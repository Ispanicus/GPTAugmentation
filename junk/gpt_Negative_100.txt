Amazon review: "The sample version of Staighten It Out is the more funky version that I remember hearing on the  radio, TV and at parties.  However, the version that I purchased and downloaded was a more jazzy version that I'm not familiar with and did not want.  Amazon did refunded me and stated that they would change the song available for purchase and download to match the sample song.  However, I went back to re-download the song and it is still the different version than the sample version.  After continuing my search,  I found the exact version of the song that I wanted on E Music via You Tube ."

Amazon review: "Sounds like every other wanna be dance singer who tries to copy Brittney Spears or Christina Aguilera.  Even the auto tone can't help her.  I would not recommend this.  I'm giving it one star because I can't give zero stars.  Don't buy it."
