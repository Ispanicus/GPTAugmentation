Skillful, reverberated vocals that melt steel(e). That certain air about an album that makes the discerned listener think \"80\\'s!\" and throw up the horns instinctively....\\nThese things were part of a style of metal that\\'s now considered stale, untalented, retro, and anything else of the like to many people, shamefully many who are serious fans of metal. The style is straight up meat-and-potatoes heavy metal with no frills and no apologies. A forgotten flag proudly carried in the past by bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Accept, Queensryche, Saint, W.A.S.P., Stormwitch, Fifth Angel....and Sacred Warrior. Make no mistake, Sacred Warrior\\'s debut, Rebellion, is not black metal, death metal, technical progressive algebra metal, beach metal, astral techno Jupiter moon metal, carpenter metal, symphonic metal, core-metal, coffee mug metal, or anything else except guitar heavy, scream filled, in your face American traditional/power metal in the vein of the masters. In other words, this 1988 album serves as a great reminder of just why most metal fans got into metal in the first place. The songs here are simple, but extremely hooky, and always chock full of ultra great, over the top guitar playing and singing. There\\'ll be no sheep heads flying off the stage, no deep nihilistic misanthropic whitebread message, no \\'artful\\' avante garde snobbiness, no crap at all to be found. What there will be is a lot of banging of head due to the solid songwriting to be found here and trying to sing along with vocalist Rey Parra, a criminally overlooked belter in the style of Geoff Tate and Michael Kiske who can easily hold his own with the giants.\\nAlthough there is a bit of variation in the overall quality of the songs on Rebellion, there are no real weak ones at all. There is a silly moment or two, such as in the opener, Black Metal - which doesn\\'t seem to have a single thing to do with black metal at all, but does have a good line or two denouncing conformity within metal (\\'You try so hard to be like everyone else\\'). A weak melody here and there is also present, but Rey Parra\\'s signature vibrato-drenched screams at the end close it off on a good note. Aside from the B-grade opener every single song is a winner, with some more obvious highlights in some places. Roughly half the album can be classified in the latter group, starting with the third song, Mad, Mad World. This song is simply an unbelievable piece of hard rock influenced, galloping heavy metal. The vocal layering in the chorus is enough to make the song amazing on it\\'s own, but there\\'s also the shredding of guitarist Bruce Swift (easily one of the most underrated metal guitarists), the sledgehammer headbanging part after the second chorus, and some extra virtuosoic vocal work by Parra after the solo.. the man can almost be seen red-faced, singing so hard his vocal cords are sticking out of his throat. Even the lyrics (which speak out about the deceptive and superficial nature of society) are pretty great, which is a good thing. Not that the content itself of the album is bad - there are a lot of uplifting messages of encouragement (Children of the Light, title track), warning (Master of Lies, Stay Away from Evil), and glorification of Jesus Christ (every song). The band\\'s lyric writing ability is simply somewhat pedestrian on this album, so while there is always at least one good line to be found, overall the lyrics are almost too simple and minimalistic. Thankfully, however, they never get awkward or silly, except for a little bit in the aforementioned Black Metal, with the chorus sporting the line, \\'Long hair, parted between the eyes/Silk pants, wrapped tight round your thighs/Each day goes by, you\\'re living a dream\\'. Yes, there\\'s no questioning that it was 1988...\\nGoing back to the rest of the songs, not each song is the best of them, but every song has at least one great <i>defining</i> moment in it (usually the chorus) that really helps make the song, which is why Rebellion is such a solid album. Then, some songs are just top quality, such as Mad, Mad World, Stay Away From Evil, which is a shorter song but has some good riffwork and one of the more infectious choruses to be found, Famine, a mid paced song that harkens directly back to Number of the Beast/Piece of Mind era Iron Maiden and features Rey Parra doing his very best Geoff Tate impersonation, and The Heavens are Calling, another galloper with some fiery solos and more catchy vocal work. The interesting thing about the chorus vocals on this album - like on The Heavens are Calling - is that many times instead of singing different verses with a set melody, there will be only one or two actual lines in the chorus, but introduced by \\'general\\' vocalizations, like a \\'Whooaaa, ohh ohhh\\', which helps give Rebellion a refreshing flair. There is also Children of the Light and Master of Lies, both excellent speed metal songs with big chorus hooks carried by Parra\\'s huge vocal range and Bruce Swift laying down riff after riff and solo after solo. On a small negative note, the drums sound a bit odd on the faster songs - that\\'s not to say that Tony Velazquez does a bad job behind the drumkit, but the drums just seem to be more engineered for the more midpaced, anthemic songs, and so when there\\'s double bass pounding, the drum triggers stick out like a sore thumb. Of course, it could just be chalked up as part of the album\\'s charm depending on your opinion.\\nThe rest of the songs could be considered average, but not filler, which is important when an album has only 11 songs or under. Regardless, there\\'s still something incredibly cool about each one, like the big riff/solo set in the closer, Sword of Victory.\\nRebellion is the kind of album everybody who enjoys metal should have at least a few of.

The JV was formed in 1984 and ran the plant until its closing in April 2010.  It was called New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., but everyone called it \"NUMMI.\" It\\'s a fascinating narrative, with interviews of workers, labor leaders, management from the plant and business school faculty.  This is one of the best radio pieces you\\'ll ever hear.  Although the two companies were fierce competitors, each needed the other at the time.  GM needed to learn how to build high-quality small cars efficiently.  Toyota had never made a car in America and wanted a local partner for its first plant here.  Toyota chose GM\\'s Fremont assembly plant, which had been closed down as one of the worst-performing factories in the country.  Interviews with workers recounted incidents of drugs, sex, intentional sabotaging of cars, absenteeism so massive that managers would run down to the local bar to round up day workers, and constant labor-management fights.  Contrary to almost everyone\\'s advice, Toyota re-hired the vast majority of what was reputed to be one of the worst work forces in the auto industry.  These blue-collar, hard-drinking American workers were sent to Japan to train alongside Japanese workers in Toyota City to learn the Toyota Way.  Tape from those trips revealed a remarkable transformation.  Almost from the day it opened, the NUMMI plant had the highest quality of any auto plant in the U.S.  Its operations were radically different from any auto plant in America.  During its lifetime, the plant produced 8 million high-quality cars, mostly Toyota Corollas.  This program tells how this transformation was accomplished, why GM failed to learn from it and why Toyota knew GM could not copy the Toyota Way (ultimately leading to GM\\'s bankruptcy).

Buying the CD proved to be a big disappointment.  It is as though they do not think the melodies are able to stand on their own; from the very start of each track the tunes are decorated in, to my mind, a rather sickly fashion, where all the musicians must play something, however fragmented, all the time.  The pianist comes in for most of the blame here, vigorously scaling, arpeggiating and trilling all over the place so that the humbler wind and string players are relegated to the background even if they have the principal theme : not that the principal theme stays constant for very long as previously mentioned.  There is an overall impression of improvisation which, praiseworthy when done well, often results here in strange harmonies and overlaps which undermine the shape and feeling of the piece so that major or minor tonality has barely any effect.  Incessant decorative twiddles and runs of the piano in a higher register than the main theme trivialise all the pieces and become very tiresome thoughout.  The pianist is obviously a dominant member of the group and quite skilled, but should have been toned down in the recording for overall balance.  String and wind players play tiny irrelevant fragments when the piano has what should be a solo.  It seems as though they reach a consensus about a chord and as long as each plays something vaguely belonging to that chord it will be OK.  Inevitably, the rhythms suffer, indeed, are sometimes lost in this jumble.

I am also very connected to Angels, and I believe that through meditation, visualization, listening, praying and envoking the Archangels and Guardian Angels, that they can be with us at all times, under all circumstances, and helping us with every aspect of our lives. I believe we can heal Physically and Emotionally by communicating with our angels on a daily basis from a place of love and gratitude.\\n\\nI Do a lot of Angel Work, Crystal Therapy, Color Therapy, Chakra Clearing and Centering,, meditation, Visualization, Guided Imagery, Yoga etc..and they are all connected. I also spend as much time in Nature as possible, spending time in nature with the living breathing spirit of Mother Earth and her wisdom, with trees, fresh air, flowers, water, sunshine, moon, grass, rock formation etc.. is just another way to reinforce the healing energies that are available to us if we can just tap into them.\\n\\nI have a lot of Audio CD\\'s of guided meditations, imagery and visualizations that I adore that mostly encorporate Angels and/or nature into them since that is what resonates with me personally.\\n\\nThe reason I am so impressed with Danielle Dove\\'s \"Meditating with Angels\" and gave it 5 stars, is because she encorporated  the aspects of healing with BOTH Angels AND Nature. She manages to sooth and relax you with her beautiful Angelic calming voice, while explaining why nature and Angels are so important to our health and well being, and how they can heal us.  Danielle leads you through beautiful, peaceful meditations focusing on each Chakra,one at a time, to help you Clear and open your Chakras energies for more love, light and healing.\\n\\nAnother thing that I really liked about Danielle\\'s Chakra meditations, is that she does focus on each one seperately for a nice amount of time, yet, they all seamlessly transition into one another. Danielle starts with the Root Chakra, and then as she progresses upward to each additional Chakra, incorporates the new clearing and openess from the previous one you just worked on, into the next one, then those two into the next one, and so forth, so you can really feel how they are not just all seperate energy centers within us, but are in fact all connected on a very fundamental level.\\n\\nI have heard some CD\\'s where you feel almost \\'rushed\\' to move from one thought to another, or one feeling to another, having to transition and visualize quickly in order to keep up with the speaker... which in my opinion, no matter how good the content is, is not relaxing or effective, because without being able to fully relax and open, you cannot get to the place of inner work you need to get to. I have several CD\\'s that I love the content of, but listen to during the day while working or so forth instead, because they cannot relax me for a meditation sessiion do to the fast pace of the content.\\nDanielle does a wonderful job of not talking, or \\'moving\\' through her explanations or guided meditations too quickly, thus allowing you time to fully relax, \"sink\" into the comfort of her voice. and become still in mind and body, to be able to focus completely on what she is saying, and visualize it, and literally feel it.\\n\\nDanielle\\'s CD \"Meditating with Angel\\'s\" also has the most glorious backround water sounds that plays at just the right volume. It doesn\\'t overpower her voice, or distract you from the meditations, however, you can hear it softly in the backround which is just perfect, and adds the extra element of relaxation and connection with nature.\\n\\nI highly recommend this CD!

All the songs was produced by Sylvers\\' member, Ricky Sylvers (Leon Sylvers\\' younger brother) and veteran songwriter, Gene Dozier, explaining why the album sounds a little bit like a Shalamar album, but with major differences with how the instrumental arrangements was made (in which in part were done by Leon Sylvers himself). \"High Hopes,\" \"Good & Plenty,\" \"You Shake Me Up,\" and \"Have It Your Way\" were outstanding examples on why the album should have gotten the recognition it was deprived of. \"Looking For You\" was a bouncy track yet funkier version of \"Take Your Time.\" Although this wasn\\'t the best SOS Band album (in my opinion); it was the best before they reached superstardom when black music made a major shift in 1982-83.

I was blown away when this unassuming chap came on and belted out in an unbelievable display of vocal range, tone and powerful delivery an extremely well written song called \"Love You Like I Never Loved Before.\" I just loved the way the song combined powerful rock power chords with tender balladic lyrics which wasn\\'t very common at the time but which was quickly imitated ever since. I remember ever since that night I spent many days trying to find that track somewhere on cassette but with no success. I finally found it on a bootleg copy of a various hits compilation (there were many of these in those days).  What my brother managed to find in the meantime though was an original, legal version of \"Close-Up\" or the Japanese version of \"Danger\" on cassette which between ourselves we listened to until all the oxide fell off the tape.  It was just that enjoyable an album and although \"Danger\" is no \"Close-Up\" I guess it\\'ll have to do until we also get a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of \"Close-Up\" too.\\n\\nPleasant results usually follow the collaboration of great songwriters and great singers and we get no exception here. The Joey Carbone/Richie Zito/Kathi Pinto partnership on one side and The Great Voice on the other has resulted in a very strong release of love song crooning in one of its better incarnations.  Unlike the debut album which had one cover all the tracks here are originals.  There are many standout tracks here that show a vast improvement over the debut album release.  Tracks like my favourite \"Our Love\", \"I\\'m The One\", \"Deep In the Night\", \"I Don\\'t Want To Love Your Love\", \"Through the Eyes of Love\", \"Take Me Back\" and the bonus track \"Inside This Heart of Mine\" are just very well written songs and the other 3 bonus tracks of live material add to the overall enjoyment of the main course.\\n\\nThe mlps release itself is not much to shout about not being one of the better designs and assembly that I have ever seen but the sound quality is very good. Also included is a foldout containing all the lyrics in English.\\n\\nFor fans of the early 80s romantic ballad genre ala Jim Photoglo, Paul Davis, Dan Fogelberg etc this release comes highly recommended!', 1, 1), (\"If it were possible to rate this zero stars, I would.

I have.\" He then inquires, \"Baby, can you see me now?\" Here in this tender ballad, inspired by writer Glen Hirshberg\\'s Book of Bunk, Nathan displays his sensitive and attuned eye for poetic metaphors that are sparse yet accurate descriptors of love, hardship, and what is, at times, the inexplicable journey we\\'re all on in our lives.\\n\\nHe captures what it means to be alone and, particularly, what it means to put love at the forefront of anything else that we think matters.\\n\\nIt is in this, with Nathan\\'s sharp gaze at life, that his songs illuminate how we all are taken in and either worn smooth or left ragged by this journey. Nathan credits much of his inspiration for songs from the works of well-established writers: Hirshberg, Sebastian Matthews, and his father: poet, Marvin Bell, amongst others.\\nYet, his songs stand as unique creative works in their own right as well. One doesn\\'t need to know all of the literary references to still get his music.\\n\\nIn \"American Crow,\" Nathan describes his character Crow as a man who never stays put, symbolized by \" . . . tattooed wings beneath [his] skin.\" In this opening line, I hear echoes of the \"Crow\\'s\" who have passed through my life. I acknowledge my own impulse to take flight at various junctures. When he sings, \"Black feathers/Hollow bones/Nowhere left/For the light to go/ Sitting on a fence post at the side of the road, American Crow,\" I\\'m reminded of Paul D in Toni Morrison\\'s Beloved who \" . . . didn\\'t believe he could live with a woman---any woman---for over two out of three months. That was as long as he could abide in one place.\"  I suspect that Crow, like Paul D, leaves because it\\'s the only way he feels free, and it\\'s a liberation that dodges heartache.\\n\\nNathan\\'s songs lay bare the inclination to wrap ourselves in deceits so that we might avoid facing our own mortality and flaws. In \"Me and Larry,\" Nathan reminisces on his connection with the late-writer, Larry Brown. He sings, \"Somehow always in the end/We become the tales we tell.\"  Later, he reflects, \"It was twenty years ago my friend/When I thought that we weren\\'t mortal men.\"  He traces the trajectory of believing in time eternal just where it fades as we approach middle age, an age when we begin to experience the loss of others, once young with us.\\n\\nBlack Crow Blue, however, isn\\'t a bleak album.\\n\\nYes, Nathan writes about tough times, exploitation, and unfair treatment. But he never neglects the thread of love or shard of hope that holds us together. We hear this in \"A Stone\\'s Throw\" when he sings of a man barely getting by, reeling from a bad economy and poverty. While others want to turn their heads in shame, the singer tells us, \"But I look them in the eyes/Say man, it\\'s me, don\\'t you realize/We\\'re all we\\'ve got if we\\'re going to survive.\" Ultimately, the song stresses that type of survival: through community, even in the face of unjustness.\\n\\n(A notable mention here: \"Stone\\'s Throw Away\" was picked up by singer Lizanne Knott for her upcoming 2013 release Standing in the English Rain. She does a kick-ass rendition and arrangement, worthy of checking out.)\\n\\nOn the album\\'s closing track, \"We All Get Gone,\" Nathan digs into a strict blues groove, his wailing harmonica getting as much play time as his vocals.  He moans, \" . . . I\\'m just traveling/Watch me traveling away/Cause get it right or get wrong, sooner or later/We all get gone.\" Despite the resolute attitude of the singer, Nathan conveys a candor that is welcoming and intimate. I\\'m feeling as though I\\'m sitting at a coffeehouse table one dusky evening while Nathan strums, picks, toots his harmonica, and lights up the stage with his voice.\\n\\nThroughout Black Crow Blue, Nathan\\'s vocals, measured and at times with a grittiness reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen, deliver the lyrics with clear-headed certainty of the stories he tells. His descriptive guitar playing, forceful when necessary, provides the clean well-structured melodies that turn his poems to song.

The majority of those recordings were journeys to find what they came across here. A lot of people who have managed to discover Passport\\'s wonderful and imaginative type of electric jazz  often describe this as their finest album. Don\\'t know how I feel about that. But I can certainly see why someone might think so.\\n\\n  For one this album embodies just about all the qualities that make Passport special. There\\'s the dreamy and often abstract nature of the arrangements in these compositions. Also the instrumental choices. The title song is the first example. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes it\\'s an exciting journey from progressive rock type theatrics,into blues and than out and out funk. When Klaus comes in on sax,the sound he produces is rather soft and melodic compared to the phased electric keyboards,synthesizers providing the harmony. It\\'s a beautiful contrast of melody and rhythm. \"Homunculus\" is very rhythmically flamboyant but again never loses that center of instrumental control either. \"Jadoo\" and \"Will-O-Whisp\" on the other hand,perhaps anticipating Doldinger\\'s interest in film scores provide us with blacksploitation influence cinematic funk with a heavy dance orientation as well.\\n\\n  \"Albatross Song\",with it\\'s breezier rhythm and the spare ballad \"Damals\" showcase the band itself playing in a somewhat more understated manner more in the league of how Klaus himself is playing here. Doldinger is a very moody player/composer. Capble of being brooding and low key one moment and flamboyant to the point of being highly aggressive the next.  The rhythm section of keyboardist Kristian Schultze,bassist/guitarist Wolfgang Schmid and drummer Curt Cress are perfectly attuned to these shifting musical passions he tends to have. Even though they are European and tend to be localized in that area of the world,I still have trouble understanding why their sound never caught on. Maybe it was more that electric jazz/fusion/funk-jazz anywhere had a bit of trouble catching in,on many levels.

However, when the follow-up Duncan And Brady b/w Love Words bombed as Dunhill/ABC 4088 later in 1967 they were dropped.

This album is and they were supposed to be part of his recordings of Songs of Free Men. I had thought them lost, but they are now real and in my possession, just as directed by Joseph Toner, who told me of them. Joseph Toner wrote Polinaise, out of the great respect for Mr. Robison who had gone to the Jewish Ghetto\\'s and come out of them with his own song, in the songs of Free Men, missing the songs OF THOSE MEN. Polinaise was produced in 1945 and sung by JOHN CHARLES THOMAS, but only the original test production was ever released, the first time the name of Wrightson was used, and no person yet found to fit the face.\\n\\nMr. Robeson, he was able to perform in Othello in 1943 to rave reviews. He also sang a piece by JOHN LATOUCHE about FREEDOM in AMERICA, and was outspoken in his opinions as to how persons of color were then being treated in the US. That was originally Columbia C-49 the Ballad for Americans, Feb. 9 1940. The so called 1932 reconstruction was C-55, approx 1943, and Mr. Robison had only to sing one piece, the rest could be done alone. It was to falsify that the song YOU ARE LOVE had existed.

Following a stint in Europe in the late 1940s where he scored several film soundtracks, he returned to the U.S. in the 1950s, joining the Gordon Jenkins orchestra as their arranger. He followed that with the same work at Big Top Records, a label launched in 1958 by Johnny Bienstock, where he also released one single under the pseudonym Spencer Ross,  Bobby\\'s Blues/Theme Of A Lonely Evening  (Big Top 3035) in 1960. It did not chart nationally.\\n\\nHe then moved over to Columbia and CBS TV, and their subsidiary Colpix where, mostly under his real name Robert Mersey, he did arranging/conducting for artists like Andy Williams (some 17 of Andy\\'s hits were backed by Mersey), as well as Barbra Streisand, Johnny Mathis, Nina Simone, James Darren, Aretha Franklin, Johnny Nash, Dion (DiMucci), Frankie Avalon and many more. He also found time to release three more singles of his own and one LP as Spencer Ross, with the first being his only claim to national fame in terms of a hit record. That was Tracy\\'s Theme, written by Robert Archer for the female character in the December 7, 1959  CBS TV production The Philadelphia Story, originally a 1940 film and, in 1956, re-made as the musical High Society. Featuring the great saxophone work of Jimmy Abalo, and released as Columbia 4-41532 under the billing Spencer Ross, it peaked at # 13 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in January/February 1960 b/w Thanksgiving Day Parade, from the TV production Miracle On 34th Street. Why it never made any impact on the Adult Contemporary (Easy Listening) charts at the time is a mystery since it was a perfect fit for those listings.\\n\\nThat success led to the 1960 album covered here, titled simply Spencer Ross & His Orchestra (Columbia CL-1525/CS 8325) containing:  La Montana (If She Should Come To You); Carolina Moon; I Go; Dreamy Melody; Theme From \"I Am A Camera\" (Why Do I?); Hop, Skip, Jump; Tracy\\'s Theme; Song For A Summer Night; Solitaire; Play Some Music For Broken Hearts; What\\'s It Like In Paree?; Your Continental Touch. Two of the tracks - Song For A Summer Night/Dreamy Melody then came out as the single Columbia 4-41644, and a bit later in 1960 he had Theme From \"My Three Sons\"/Heaven Can Wait r4eleased as Columbia 4-41877. Neither could get him back on the charts, nor did his interpretation of Song Of India which, billed as The Bob Mersey Orchestra, came out as one side of Colpix 152 (the flip, Strangers When We Meet by the Stu Phillips orchestra, didn\\'t chart either).\\n\\nIn 1962 he apparently released an acclaimed - and yet obscure - album on Gallant Records titled Great Jazz From Great TV which, although showing on the label that it was composed, arranged and conducted by Bob Mersey, was credited to yet another pseudonym - \"Det Moore & His Orchestra.\" This contains: Jazz Dramatic; Club Cool; Forever Frantic; Call Girl; and Flutesville, among others from shows like Ben Casey, Route 66, The New Breed, Manhunt, My Three Sons, Window On Main Street, Armstrong Circle Theater, Kraft Mystery Theater, and Play Of The Week.\\n\\nI\\'m surprised some outfit like Collectables or Collector\\'s Choice hasn\\'t yet remastered both albums for CD format.

The high octane tune is an exhilarating romp between Jackson and Bartlett, Jr. as though they have played together for years.

He is a most-skilled practitioner of the art, with the kind of poetic style that may seem old fashioned in an age of clarifying, analyzing, and elucidating every note. It seems to me that the best pianists--Pollini, Ashkenazy, Perahia, Argerich, Brendel, Kovacevich, Rubinstein, Gilels, Richter, Michelangeli, Janis, et al--generally combine the two approaches. We\\'ll see how Mailley-Smith proceeds in his career, and whether he can equal what only a handful of pianists have already accomplished.\\n\\nThat said, there\\'s a lot to like here.\\n\\nMailley-Smith opens the program with the Fantasie Impromptu No. 4, Op. 66, an excerpt from which you can hear below. The track pretty much exemplifies everything the man does on the disc. It\\'s lush and it\\'s plush, and it will blow your house down. Not that it\\'s slow or lackadaisical, however; indeed, it is fleet and surefooted. It\\'s just that Mailley-Smith so caresses each note, it sounds as though he\\'s making love to the instrument (a Steinway model D). This is not only Romantic piano playing, this is a romance between the performer and the music. It\\'s quite hypnotic, actually.\\n\\nAnd so it goes through fourteen items on the disc, each one played in a smooth, flowing, polished, yet thoroughly engaging manner. Mailley-Smith performs with flourish and sensitivity, pointing up every ornate contrast the composer has to offer.\\n\\nWith the exception of just a few items, the numbers on the album duplicate the program presented on pianist Idil Biret\\'s very fine collection of favorites for Naxos. So, I had a good comparison there without having to dive into five or six different CD collections of nocturnes, waltzes, etudes, etc. And what I can say is that Mailley-Smith acquits himself very well next to his older compatriot, matching Ms. Biret in virtuosity and sensitivity and surpassing Naxos\\'s slightly clearer but edgier sound. While it is still open to question whether Mailley-Smith will ever match Pollini or Rubinstein in Chopin, we shall see, but he\\'s off to a promising start.\\n\\nThe Nocturne No. 2 in D flat, Op. 27 is as creamy and dreamy as anyone could wish for. The Etude No. 8 in F major, Op. 10, nicknamed \"Sunshine,\" is all bright light and sunny skies. The famous Prelude No. 15, Op. 28, \"Raindrop,\" exudes the sort of beauty you want, with a wholly appropriate gentleness of touch. The \"Minute Waltz\" comes through with flying colors, and sounds less breathless by the end than we sometimes hear it. Then, there\\'s a degree of melancholic dignity in the Waltz No. 2 in C sharp minor, Op. 64 that\\'s refreshing.\\n\\nInterestingly, both Mailley-Smith and Biret open and close their programs with the same two selections, the aforementioned \"Fantasie\" Impromptu and the Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. Just as interesting is Mailley-Smith\\'s inclusion of the Souvenir de Paganini, a delightful little set of variations one doesn\\'t often encounter. It rounds out a program that quite won me over. Mailley-Smith provides the kind of Romantic expressiveness that makes him a crowd pleaser.\\n\\nIf I have any minor argument with the disc, it\\'s that it provides less than an hour (55\\'05) of content. Surely, the pianist has other favorites he could have included, or was it a matter of cost considerations in recording? I don\\'t know, and it\\'s a small matter in any case.\\n\\nGood, realistic piano sound, too.\\n\\nJohn J.

I will say that, after 15 to 20 listens, this is their most accomplished and impressive work to date.  It really didn't hit me initially; the first couple spins didn't form any kind of opinion one way or the other and, while there wasn't anything that seemed `bad' about the music, it was just too dense to soak in right away.  But I highly recommend giving it a chance to grow on you as I guarantee you'll be just as rewarded as I was.  First, I think the production on this is by far their greatest; it's incredibly dense, multi-layered, and strikes the perfect balance of what I believe they were trying to do (and failed, in my opinion) with `Common Existence', in maintaining a dynamic of lo-fi, gritty, noisy texture with extremely technical and varied arrangements and instrumentation.  Next, one of the major surprises I'm sure many fans are going to encounter is that there really isn't much screaming on the album - maybe 30 seconds to a minute combined (and only present on 3 or 4 songs).  However, it would be incorrect to assume this is a `soft' album.  The aggression presented here is more subliminal and abstract then their prior work, which makes complete sense and is a perfect move for a band that is continuously evolving (and which is why they are still musically-relevant today even with being (unfortunately) roped into a genre that has long since died).  Take, for instance, the bridge in `A Darker Forest'; while there isn't any screaming, the music picks up after each verse with a thick riff, pounding snare and synth-bell accents, bringing to mind a passage the Swans might write, which is a fitting example of another band that understands how to create true heaviness with dynamics in more creative and minimal ways than what's usually expected.  And in regards to the drumming, this is clearly the drummer's best work.  In fact, from a musical perspective, this really is everyone's best work and it's more evident the more the CD is digested.  I wouldn't even know how to rate the songs individually as I always listen to the album in full as sequenced, which, I may add, could not be possibly arranged any better.  Overall, Thursday pushed forward again with an album that far exceeded personal expectations, especially after fearing a potential `Common Existence 2'.

It has been as heavily hyped as the sonata set itself. I own the sonata box set, and was disappointed with much of it. Here, I hoped for better from Lewis, but came away I am even more disappointed.\\n\\nThe Diabelli Variations are among the most difficult piano marathon/obstacle courses in music, taxing and trying to performers and audiences alike, and capable of exposing many a pianists technical weaknesses as well as the deficiencies in interpretation and range of expression. Sadly, I don't think Lewis fared well.\\n\\nOn both this recording and the sonata cycle, I hear from Lewis:\\n\\n-Plushly upholstered, dull-edged Beethoven.\\n-A big, thick, dark, heavy piano sound, that you will either like or not. I don't care for it. Lewis piano tuning (on a Steinway) and technique add to the effect.\\n-An approach that uses a lot of rubato and extensive use of piano effects (and I think more pedal) than most, which adds to the sludgy thickness and heaviness.\\n-Dull-edged centrist/middle of the road interpretation and performance. Thoughtful to the point of being overthought, and at many times lost and meandering. Often boring. Better on lyrical and hushed passages, awkward on the rest. Lacking variety in character and expression.\\n-Soft, rounded off legato phrasing. This is my main issue with Lewis. He resorts to slidy legato phrasing through much of the music, far beyond what is called for. Edges are blunted, rounded, and smoothed over---no chiseling, no pinpoint articulation. Musical lines, dynamics, accenting, and attacks are all rounded off and soft-edged (even when he is more forceful and aggressive).\\n- Closely miked acoustic that is on the boomy side, further accentuating thickness, fuzziness, and heaviness.\\n\\nSome of Lewis playing is more boisterous on the Diabellis than on the sonatas, but this is not necessarily for the better. Both his performance and recorded sound strike me as heavy-handed and limited expressively. There is awkward lumbering in some passages where deftness and agility is demanded, meandering in others, and some passages where he is just leaden. Midrange and mushy, and at worst, almost unctuous.\\n\\nIm a fan of the approach that in theme and variations, the opening theme is usually something quaint, therefore it should either be performed relatively straight or tongue in cheek, to set the stage. Or it must be done with flair and attitude. Lewis does neither. He starts by bullrushing through it, and with legato, charmlessly. And then promptly, starting with the first set of variations that should boldly announce itself with attitude and wit, he is dull and leaden (and legato), and pretty much stays there for dozens more.\\n\\nI took issue with Lewis phrasing and rubato on the sonatas, and how too many of the movements seemed to be too similar in character, and here on the Diabellis, I hear much of the same again. Especially for this work, there has to be clear delineation and character in each movement, but it all sounds too alike. The fact that he runs many of the variations together without pause doesnt help matters. Things don't improve much as each variation passes by. More legato.\\n\\nLewis is better in the most hushed and quiet variations, but still manages to make these sound less than riveting. Most importantly, there is a lack of movement to movement connection---a point of view--- that is essential to maintaining a listeners focus all the way through this massive, tricky work. At times, Lewis seems to go off on tangents, lost in the woods. There are dead spots, including in the all-important final variations, where poignancy is required.\\n\\nIt did not take me long to lose interest in this performance.\\n\\nIt reminded me of Andrei Vieru's version, which was also big and (too) legato-edged.\\n\\nTo be fair, there are many recordings of the Diabellis that, for various reasons, also fall short. It is tough work to pull off. Some interpreters, including big names, also have a bad legato habit. So Lewis' version has a lot of unfortunate company.\\n\\nCompared to Lewis version, Piotr Anderszewskis 2000 recording of these same Diabelli Variations is a huge breath of fresh air that I turn to for relief. Anderszewskis idiosyncratic version is well known and appropriately viewed as a reference, so comparisons are inevitable. I hear far more fine detail, crispness, wit, depth and insight with Anderszewskis. Every variation is distinct and different, as they should be. More importantly, Anderszewski did a better job holding my attention through the entire work, while Lewis did not.\\n\\nBesides Anderszewski, there are good number of other performances of the Diabellis that I prefer, each with better energy, expressiveness and clarity. They include Filippo Gorini, Vladimir Feltsman, Ingrid Andsnes, Laurent Cabasso, Christian Leotta, Igor Levit, and Martin Helmchen among more recent recordings, and also Richter, John O'Conor, and Alfred Brendel (Lewis' mentor), just to name a few others. I like William Kinderman's recording, and there is a deluxe edition reissue that includes a lecture. Gorini, whose astounding Diabelli recording is in many ways what Lewis' should have been, is also a Brendel student. (Let's see what happens to him from here.) Pier Paolo Vincenzi's set on Brilliant Classics features both Beethoven's and the 51 other variations of other composers. So there are a lot of interesting alternatives to Lewis'.\\n\\nCan I recommend Paul Lewis version to anyone? If you like legato, a thick warm piano sound, and velvety dull-edged approachable Beethoven, Lewis might satisfy you.\\n\\nFor more jaded ears, who have heard a lot of the predecessors and expect the very highest and deepest in Beethoven, you may, as I do, find Lewiss Beethoven to be a frustrating mixed bag.\", 0, 0), ('Jorge y Marcela;\\n\\nEste es un excellente trabajo, mis respetos para uds. y todos los demas musicos participantes, Jorge, gracias por lo que muestras en tus teclados, me parece super buenisimo tu trabajo.\\n\\nMarcela, tu voz es super melodiosa y muy especial me gusta muchisimo todo lo que cantas en este projecto, mil felicidades!!\\n\\nPor ultimo, que orgullo que en Mexico haya Maestros de esta talla, son unicos!\\n\\nSigan haciendo su arte!', 1, 1), ('Made a mistake in purchasing this.\\nNeed to complain to customer service.', 0, 0), (\"Doesn't sound the same as the original.

Her delivery on certain lines is also pleasing, in a way that only Britney can sometimes deliver (see the pronunciation of 'hazy' on 'Hold It Against Me').\\n\\nIt's pretty obvious that this was a ploy to get S&M to number one on Billboard, and it worked.

Norman Del Mar compared it to the Festliches Prludium (Festive Prelude for Orchestra and Organ) in which a vast orchestra piles one towering climax upon another. Strauss conducted the work for recording in late 1940 with the Bavarian State Opera Orchestra (possibly he recorded it before the Tokyo premiere); this recording was issued on CD in 1990 by Deutsche Grammophon in a 3-CD set of Strauss conducting his own works (catalogue number 429 925-2 GDO3), and four years later on Preiser 90205.\\n\\nI didn\\'t do my due diligence and run the Japanese webpage through Google Translate (though it has significant problems translating Japanese into intelligible English).

In 1940, the Germans were pioneers of hi-fi sound, though they may have kept this capability secret, given that Hitler used this recording technology to prerecord his speeches, so they could be transmitted from 3-4 different halls at the same time as he was giving his speech live somewhere. Being a murderous dictator, I presume that he wouldn\\'t have liked to give out advance notice to the RAF about where he was going to appear \"live\" so they could drop a few bombs on him so he could appear dead (something close to that would happen to one of Goebbels\\' Reich-wide propaganda radio transmissions, which embarrassingly went off the air a few minutes after it started due to a British bombing raid on Berlin, probably prompting many angry Germans to shout \"MEYER!\" in frustration). I guess that\\'s why they didn\\'t share this Vergeltungswaffe with the Tojo regime.\\n\\nAt the very least, considering that this is one of only 2 recordings of the Japanese Festival Music - don\\'t trust those \"Strauss\\' Complete Symphonic Works\" CD compilations out there people - I would have expected the Japanese to remaster the sound to a standard that it is possible to listen to. As it is, I wouldn\\'t bother listening to this recording, though from what little I could hear, the music wasn\\'t as bad as del Mar made it out to be.

It contains most, but not all of their hit singles, plus album cuts. The difference between this and other compilations of the group\\'s music is that this has interviews interspersed between some of the songs. Both John Philips and Cass Elliot were interviewed in 1969, and they give some personal and historic insight about the group in interview snippets. Another difference is that there are some tracks with studio chatter and rehearsal takes, with ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT containing the longest rehearsal of the group practicing the song, and Michelle bursting out laughing because they sang it so fast. I CAN\\'T WAIT contains some parts of the group trying the song out, while DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DANCING BEAR, and DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY contain some studio chatter at the beginning or end, or with DANCING BEAR, has John saying at the end that he never really finished the song. All of this is illuminating for the ultra Mamas and Papas fan. But if you may be bothered by hearing some conversation between or at the end of songs, another greatest hits album may be the one for you. This was issued to appeal to the collector, and the original pressing of it as a BOX SET with the booklet is the version to own. The box set version has a beautiful booklet filled with photos, and liner notes entitled \" The Last of the Magic Groups \" by the same writer , Andy Wickham , who did the notes to the group\\'s first album. Lyrics to Mamas & Papas songs are included, but strangely, not every song here has the lyrics, and some not on the set are printed as well. Beware of other printings of this album that do not have the box or the booklet. Both ABC/Dunhill and MCA issued this album into the 70\\'s and 80\\'s in a regular double gatefold with only the lyrics, no booklet. Earlier copies on ABC/Dunhill as a double album gatefold may or may not contain the booklet, even though the cover still had printed \" includes many photos \". The later pressings by MCA just stated \" includes many lyrics \" on the cover. Also, this anthology features songs from just the first 3 Mamas and Papas albums. There is not even one song from the excellent 1968 break-up album \" THE PAPAS & THE MAMAS \" , so hits like TWELVE-THIRTY, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME and SAFE IN MY GARDEN are missing from this set, making it incomplete for a thorough hits collection.\\n\\nThis album is the last and only time that ABC/Dunhill still had the original studio sessions of The Mamas & The Papas released on an album. Sometime in the early to mid 1970\\'s, ABC Records threw out master tapes from their storage facilities. Unbelievable but that\\'s the sad case. It may have had to do with the lawsuit that the group instituted in 1973 for unpaid royalties, as ABC would sell their catalog albums as direct cut-outs to the budget bins, and not pay their artist\\'s royalties. How very sad that there are no original studio sessions available of any of the group\\'s master tapes for decades now . That is why there aren\\'t any unreleased songs, alternate mixes, different takes, or remixes done on Mamas and Papas reissues, except for 4 songs on the \" 16 OF THEIR GREATEST HITS \" CD issued by MCA in 1986. Somehow, 4 songs survived with either longer fades or a different mix. Some of the studio chatter/rehearsal takes of some of the \" A GATHERING OF FLOWERS \" versions have been issued on CD, such as on the \" CREEQUE ALLEY \" 2 CD set in 1992, and on the UK \" COMPLETE ANTHOLOGY \" 4 CD box set.\\n\\nIn addition to the collector\\'s item appeal of the original box set with booklet, ABC/Dunhill also released a promo only 45 with similar album cover artwork that contains some additional interview snippets with John and Cass.\\n\\nSide One: STRAIGHT SHOOTER, MONDAY MONDAY, TRIP STUMBLE AND FALL, GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO, I CALL YOUR NAME\\nSide Two:DANCING IN THE STREET, ONCE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT, CREEQUE ALLEY, DANCING BEAR\\nSide Three:I CAN\\'T WAIT, DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE, FREE ADVICE, DO YOU WANNA DANCE, SPANISH HARLEM\\nSide Four:GOT A FEELIN, NO SALT ON HER TAIL, WORDS OF LOVE, I SAW HER AGAIN LST NIGHT, DID YOU EVER WANT TO CRY,', 1, 1), ('If you enjoy guitar music, you will love these guys!

I had never heard of it, though myself and other Ace Enders fans had both of his previous albums. Still to this day I haven\\'t met one person who knows about this album - and I feel this is a tragedy. Which is why I decided to review it.\\nThis album is a little different than the first two. I would say the first two have somewhat of a pensive/experimental feel, but while this is still existent in Gold Rush it seems that instead of super long track titles and background noise Ace has turned to his ability to make simple, yet irresistibly charming music. Acoustic guitars, simple but exciting drum beats, tambourines (i think), shakers (like maracas. Not the religious sect that came from the Religious Society of Friends), and Ace Enders vocals make up 90% of the surface of every track. Someone could argue this album is more \\'pop\\' than the previous, but I believe that would miss the point because it seems that Ace is actually going against the grain of experimentation that is all over in indie music now and just writes with his heart using the traditional mediums. The lyrics really connect with you in a way that pop never could.\\nbut on past my rant: I\\'ll review the tracks:\\n\\nGold Rush - opens up with percussion including the shaker and Ace\\'s amazing vocals, and never looks back. Great track that deserves to be the title track. It will remind you of some of the tracks on The World We Know with it\\'s pensive feel (and especially lyrics) and a chorus that you just can\\'t resist singing along with. (8/10 rating)\\n\\nLame Duck - Beautiful mix of vocals, drums, and acoustic/electric guitar riffs (and later on the shakers) that no one else could pull off as well as Ace. This track doesn\\'t have anything in it to make it stand out from the rest of the album which is why I rate it lower (though I love lyrics), but it still has the same charm. (7.5/10)\\n\\nConnected - Amazing catchy guitar riffs really make this song, that while overall has a slower tempo than most of the album it still seems it would be the best candidate for a single. If I wanted anyone (regardless of their genre tastes) to be curious about this album I would show them this one. Check it out (10/10)\\n\\nComplications - While this track seems overshadowed by \"Connected\" because it is relatively similar (tempo, instrument makeup) but doesn\\'t have as catchy of guitar riffs, but the more I\\'ve listened to it, it has come to speak for itself. Make sure you wait until the last 30 seconds for everyone to come in with their parts - you\\'ll be glad you did. (8/10)\\n\\nHad To Be There - Don\\'t discount this one because the intro sounds almost identical to \"Complications\" (same drum beat and similar acoustic riffs), however this track is a gem. It has one of the best choruses and bridges on the album. While I\\'m never sure what the lyrics are talking about sometimes, I love singing with them (whether the lead or background vocals). (9/10)\\n\\nDon\\'t Leave Me - though this track might not seem as good to someone not used to Ace\\'s unique voice (though he does temper it with some subtle distortion or something), the percussion in this song and the catchy singing of the track title should win you over. Also this track seems the most mature for some reason. Perhaps because each section (verse, chorus, bridge, outro) seem different from each other yet stand on their own as good.(9.5/10)\\n\\nMisery -  after listening to this album this has become my new favorite. Probably the simplest song on the album, with the verse having only guitars and drums, and the chorus repeats exactly and doesn\\'t seem cluttered at all. Though it is really simple and might not be anyone else\\'s favorite, I just absolutely love the lyrics because of the way he defines Love. Normally i\\'d probably give it an 8/10, but because I love the lyrics it gets: (10/10)\\n\\nGods - This is the one track where the electric guitars really rule over the acoustic. Interesting harmonies that do work but don\\'t sound \\'beautiful\\', rather seem more like just rock music. At first this song was too repetitive for me (and therefore exemplified the only shortcomings of the album) and so I really didn\\'t care for it. Interestingly enough I actually came to really like it myself, which is why it gets an: (8/10)\\n\\nTrain Stop - This song is refreshing if you\\'ve listened to the whole album chronologically because its verse drumbeat is different from all the other tracks. There\\'s a great mix of Ace singing quietly and also giving it his all. Electric guitar riffs go throughout the background and make it never boring to listen to. While it finishes the album off well, it seems almost to leave you wanting more on purpose. (8.5/10)\\n\\nIn conclusion this album is what it is and won\\'t make excuses for it\\'s possibly repetitive music and themes. Overall, this album has simple music put to some of the best lyrical writing out there, and deserves a chance from every Ace Enders fan.

Goldsby recently released a new book and companion CD both titled \"Waltz of the Asparagus People.\" The book is subtitled \"The Further Adventures of Piano Girl,\" and each chapter is an autobiographical story, most of which occurred after the tales in \"Piano Girl.\"\\n\\nThe fourteen piano solos on the companion CD correspond to the stories in the book and richly illustrate them with sonic colors and textures.  They also make me wonder how Goldsby could ever feel that her playing isn\\'t \"good enough\" for a concert stage. What I DO understand is the feeling of absolute panic at the thought of a full room of people sitting and listening intently rather than simply enjoying her music in the background over dinner and drinks. Goldsby\\'s piano touch is graceful and elegant, but is also completely approachable and inviting. Eight of the tracks are originals, five are her arrangements of favorites, and one was composed by her daughter, Julia. Some of the cover tunes would be considered pop music in most pianists\\' hands, but Goldsby adds such a warm and personal interpretation to them that she elevates them to a higher dimension and makes them her own. Her original compositions are even more personal and come from deep within. All fourteen pieces are exceptional with no filler anywhere on the album. The covers include Yiruma\\'s popular \"A River Flows in You,\" The \"Feather\" theme from \"Forrest Gump,\" the theme from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Comptine D\\'un Autre &Eacute;t&eacute;, L\\'apr&egrave;s-Midi\" by Yann Tiersen, and \"Air on a G String: The Glass Piano\" based on JS Bach.

The first track, Control Drug, is exactly the style that I was hoping for - nasty synth sounds with drum & bass / jungle style drums and distorted vocals.  But things quickly go downhill from there.  The next track, Shivers, is plain boring.  It\\'s one of those slow and simple songs that Alec Empire simply shouldn\\'t be doing because it\\'s not what he\\'s best at.  Stick to what works.  Although I certainly dislike the cheesy, dated, 4/4 \"house\" style of the third track, Baby Skulls, the rolling bassline, the cool synth sounds, and the way the song builds, all make up for it.  It makes me nod my head and crank up the volume, so what more can you ask for?

You will find that they are ALL for this series only, with a very few for others, BUT even those few are cross-linked right back to promote these. In comparing them you will see the exact SAME type of language usage, idiosyncracies and mispellings throughout and across all of these, under all of the different aliases. This very same person also seems to lurk here and almost immediately responds to any honest reviews by attacking the reviewer and often posting a new fake review under a different fake alias in an attempt to bury the honest review, again with the very same language characteristics and consistent mispellings. It's likely that the same will happen to this review as well.  It has already happened to my review of another disc in this series (Bach). You can even find other message boards on other sites with the same exact types of comments, language, etc. If you are doubtful of what I am saying, order it anyway and see for yourself. I'd bet you'll find yourself returning it while shaking your head in disbelief after first listen.\\n\\nI hope that Amazon will take some action against these dishonest and sleazy marketing tactics.

Though aimed at the pre-teen crowd, the songs\\' surface-level innocence often harbored erotic and psychedelic allusions that were sufficiently camouflaged to escape AM radio\\'s gatekeepers.\\n\\nThough Buddah didn\\'t corner the bubblegum market (the song of the year for 1969, \"Sugar Sugar,\" was on Don Kirshner\\'s Calendar label, for example), their output is easily the largest concentration of the genre\\'s exemplars.

Chris Potter composed all the songs on the album and conducts the performance by the 18 piece \"DR Big Band\".  Chris Potter also shows off his top of the line sax soloing skills on most of the tunes.  I\\'m not familiar with the musicians that make up the \"DR Big Band\", but I believe that they are from Denmark.  The music on the album is fairly straight-forward swinging post bop.  It does not get quite as wild as some of Potter\\'s contemporary big band leaders (e.g. Hollenbeck, JD Argue).  However, the songs are quite interesting with many intertwining parts.  Potter, who in my opinion is one of top soloists today, has many blistering solos throughout.  This is one of Potter\\'s best recordings to date.  The big band is the perfect backdrop for his fiery solos.\\n\\nSong Highlights:\\nThe Steppes - My guess is this tune is inspired by the Central Asia Steppes region.  It has a worldly tinge and reminds me of some classical pieces written by Russian composers about this part of the world.  There is a nice solo by guitarist \"Per Gade\" on this tune.\\n\\nRumination - This tune opens with a reflective Monkish statement by Potter and pianist Magnus Hjort.  It quickly segues into an upbeat, funky interlude where the drums and bass remind me a bit of something you might hear in a Super Marios game soundtrack.  Over the top of that backdrop are some nice sweeping horn lines.  About half way through the drums speed up and get frantic and so does Potter\\'s solo.\\n\\nQuick - This tunes opens up with a staccato brass and drums line.  After a few bars the reeds come in with an intertwining line.  After a few more bars the piano, bass and guitar nicely blend in.  This is a terrific opening to the tune and the album.', 1, 1), ('This CD is awesome, every song on it. These players are hot that Chris has on the CD.

Legal issues saw the collection shelved for two years so Burdon decided to return to a solo career.  Recruiting an all-star cast of friends and associates including Alex Korner and Zoot Money (who co-wrote the bulk of the album with Burdon), he went into London\\'s Advision Studios, recording 1978\\'s \"Survivor\" with former Animal Chas Chandler handling production chores.  Surrounded by a crew of this caliber and talent, you would have hoped for something inspirational from Burdon.  Didn\\'t happen.  Instead the album showcased Burdon clearly looking for direction - was he a pop star ?  An R&B act ?  A rocker ?  Burdon clearly didn\\'t know which way to turn.  The end result was a mishmash of an album that ended up pleasing nobody.  That was unfortunate since the collection exhibit flashes of true talent; especially when Burdon seemed to relax and let go of the \\'tough guy\\' image he seemed so attached to.  Check out his performances on \\'Hook of Holland\\' and \\'P.O. Box 500\\' ...  fun and way more entertaining than anything else on the album.\\n\\n- \\'Rocky\\' was a surprisingly decent slice of conventional rock with Burdon finding a key that was both comfortable and attractive.  Picture the kind of stuff bands like Slade and Status Quo were churning out in the mid-1970s and you\\'ll have a feel for this likable number.  rating: *** stars  YouTube has a clip of Burdon lip-synching the song on the German television program PopRock (love the enthusiastic German audience):[...]\\n- In contrast, the atmospheric ballad \\'Woman of the Ring\\' was a more typical performance in that it aptly reflected the damage done to Burdon\\'s voice.  Quite a pretty track, the main problem with this one was Burdon\\'s frog croak of a voice.  You were left to wonder if he was actually going to make it through the whole song.  Kicking in at the end of the song, Maggie Bell\\'s shrieky voice didn\\'t help the track.  rating: *** stars\\n- Another Burdon-Money composition, \\'The Kid\\' was another likeable mid-tempo rocker that again featured a Burdon talk-sing performance. P.P. Arnold added her shrill backing vocals to the mix and hearing the pair of them trying to out-yell one another was actually kind of fun.  rating: ** stars\\n- \\'The Tomb of the Unknown Singer\\' found Burdon trying to do country-blues number...  Pompous and overblown, this one was just plain painful to sit through.  I never thought I\\'d catch myself saying something like this, but I\\'d rather hear a Kris Kristofferson LP any day of the week.  rating: * star\\n- \\'Famous Flames\\' could have been a decent blues-rocker, but producer Chandler seemingly felt obligated to bury Burdon under waves of shrill female backing singers and an overly busy arrangement.  Oh well, this one was at least listenable.  rating: ** stars\\n- Hollywood Woman\\' was a catchy enough song, but some horrible lyrics and another strangled vocal wiped out whatever momentum was generated.  Taken from the same German television appearance referenced above, YouTube had a performance clip of the song: [...]  rating: ** stars\\n- Judging by the lyrics including the classic couplet \"she has a calculator up her red dress ...\" I\\'m guessing Burdon\\'s affection for Amsterdam didn\\'t have anything to do with the city\\'s museums.  Giving credit where due, this was easily the album\\'s stand out tune.  Burdon actually sounded engaged and as if he were having fun spitting this one out.  rating: **** stars\\n- Yeah, Burdon\\'s always enjoyed his reputation as a blues singer, but to my ears his barebones acoustic cover of \\'I Was Born To Live the Blues\\' was simply dull and plodding.  rating: * stars\\n- After the last blues number, virtually anything would have sounded good. \\'Highway Dealer\\'\\' certainly wasn\\'t any great shakes, but luckily the song included a tasty, jazz-tinged lead guitar solo.  rating: ** stars\\n- At least to my ears Burdon\\'s always sounded better when he simply relaxed and didn\\'t try too hard.  That was definitively the case on the closer \\'P.O. Box 500\\'.

It\\'s catchy enough.  \"If You Wanna\" has equally aggressive drumming and a pounding rhythm.  It\\'s really catchy and enjoyable.  \"But if you wanna come back it\\'s alright it\\'s alright, it\\'s alright if you wanna come back!\"  That\\'s actually  not the best part- the verse melody is the thing I mostly like about this tune.  \"Well I don\\'t want to wake up in the morning but I\\'ve got to face the day, that\\'s what all the friends I do not like as much as you say!\"\\n\\n\"A Lack of Understanding\" has an excellent verse melody.  Really familiar too.  The chorus is pretty good \"I\\'ve got too much time on my hands, but you don\\'t understand or you won\\'t understand\".  \"Blow It Up\" is fairly forgettable since the vocals get wishy washy, but there\\'s enough melody taking place to make it pretty good.  \"Wetsuit\" opens with hymn-like vocals.  The singer reminds me of the guy from Coldplay here.  The \"ah ah ah\" sounds like the 60\\'s song by Dusty Springfield \"I Only Want to Be With You\".  Pretty decent melody either way.  \"You want to do things differently, you\\'ll do them independently\".  I love the part \"Put a wetsuit on, come on come on, grow you hair out long come on, put a t-shirt on do me wrong, do me wrong, do me wrong!\"\\n\\n\"Norgaard\" is fast-paced memorable anthem rock.  \"Her mind\\'s made up she don\\'t want to go steady she\\'s only seventeen so she\\'s probably not ready!\" is a funny line.  \"Post Break-Up Sex\" is another memorable rocker.  \"Leave it \\'til the guilt consumes, I found you in the nearest room, all our friends were unaware, most had just passed out downstairs\"  is a good lyric.  This song carries the same rhythm and melody the whole way through but it\\'s a good one.  This band has a lot of talent because not just anyone can write a song like this and make it memorable.  Top notch songwriting puts this song in a higher category than most commercial-sounding bands who write music like this.  \"Post break up sex that helps you forget your ex, what did you expect from post break up sex?\"  VERY clever lyrics!\\n\\n\"Under Your Thumb\" is pretty decent pop/rock.  \"I don\\'t mind about taking it slow, I\\'m perfectly aware of what I\\'m yet to know, mutually assumed utterly consumed, totally adored, Eleanor!\"  A quieter song but still pretty good.  Love the \"Eleanor\" part in particular.  \"All In White\" opens predictably with the chugging bass similar to so many alternative rock bands nowadays, but these guys... well they know how to make it better than most due to strong vocal melody talents.  The melody starts out quiet but picks up the second time around when the guitars comes in.  Really good song, and the lead singer proves he can sing honest melodies.  The way he carries out certain words contains a lot of feeling.\\n\\n\"Wolf Pack\" is perhaps the only song I\\'m not fond of.  It has a fast-moving pace but it feels like it\\'s missing a strong enough melody to really grab me.  \"Family Friend\" is a relaxing tune with a much better melody.  Really good lyrics too. \"You wanna get young but you\\'re just getting older, and you had a fun summer but it\\'s suddenly colder, if you want a bit of love put your head on my shoulder it\\'s cool\"  Also love the line afterwards \"Half baked girl hey I\\'m hardly surprised, snake eyes disguise everybody\\'s lies, faded nail marks on pale thighs and an awkward secret that someone denies, and now you\\'re trying to get yourself back in, come on in\".\\n\\nThe hidden track, \"Somebody Else\\'s Child\" is a short piano ballad of sorts.

Let's just say, I was verry pleased with the purchase.\", 1, 1), ('The extensive NAXOS series on Sousa marches on with this current entry.  The interesting difference here is a new band.  No longer do we have Keith Brion leading the Royal Artillery Band of the UK.  Instead we have the Royal Norwegian Navy Band.  Why the change?  I suspect it has something to do with the new idiotic policies of the Ministry of Defense (The MoD) in London.  These bureaucrats, who seem intent on destroying what remains of British military music have instituted new rules restricting how their bands can record and perform on oversees tours.  The result is that we are likely to see fewer CDs in the immediate future of British military bands.\\n\\nThat said the Royal Norwegian Navy band certainly does a good enough job here.  The band while less known in the recording circuit performs well despite its slight numbers.  The recording quality of this series has improved steadily over the years.  Earlier on there was a thin, tinny sound to these recordings which has been corrected in recent editions.\\n\\nThe great thing about a series like this which mixes Sousa\\'s marches along with his other music is that you get a complete band concert out of it.  There are enough marches on each CD to satisfy the march connesseur like myself, along with lesser known works by Sousa.  These numerous novelty items, Overtures and selections from his Opperettas show just how talented and varied Sousa was as a composer.  He could really do it all.  As such he stands as perhaps one of America\\'s greatest composers in terms of quality and output.  Sadly much of this music is forgotten today as it was very much of its time.\\n\\nThere are a plethora of CDs out there playing the same 10 or 15 greatest march hits of Sousa over and over again.  The beauty of this series is that it promises to eventually cover all or most of his music, including the lesser known works and marches.  Each CD manages to have several well known marches on it.  Here we have \"From Maine to Oregon\"  and the ever popular \"US Field Artillery March\"  featuring the famous \"Caisson Song\"  which has morphed its way into becoming the generic US Army song.  Funny how the US Army has no desire to have a march for each element, and prefers to just lump it all in with this single tune.  This is one of the things that makes the US Army a bland entity in my humble opinion.  Having a march for each part of the army, i.e.  Infantry, Armour, Artillery, etc.  might create a greater espirit-de-corps but I guess we forgot about that some where along the way.\\n\\nAnyway, I digress here.  The overture \"Dwellers of the Western World\"  is one of Sousa\\'s larger works and deserves mention.  Modern day listeners might find the music for the Red Man and the Black Man to be a bit stereo-typed, but this was how they were seen in Sousa\\'s time.  We should not pass judgement on it.\\n\\nThis is a great series that NAXOS has embarked on over the years and the new band, while perhaps lesser known than its predessor does a fine job under the capable baton of Keith Brion.', 1, 1), (\"Reno Moisio used to be my parents' neighbor -- he recently passed away.

Had it not been for the monks\\' initial anti-proselytization policy; had they accepted all those who sought entrance, the Temple may never have been destroyed. This important lesson, often recounted by The RZA, is a perfect analogy for the Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture series. Released in 2005, volume one introduced a lineup of indie/underground emcees whose form and style were so compatible with Wu-Tang that it made for one of the year\\'s most thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) albums. In 2009, a new chamber of cross-breeding music has been opened, this time introducing a whole new genre/style to the Wu-Tang sound: Enter the Dubstep.\\n\\nDubstep originated earlier within the decade in the midst of the UK garage scene. A fusion of house, drum and bass, 2-step, and London\\'s grime, with influence from dub reggae, dubstep is characterized by its dark, uptempo beats. While artists like Lady Sovereign and Dizzee Rascal have expounded definitely-British sounds to the United States\\' audience, the movement hasn\\'t really caught on across the pond... or has it? This year alone, dubstep has made a significant leap into the consciousness of U.S. music fans, whether they knew it or not. Dubstep producers Chase and Status\\' smash track \"Eastern Jam\" was adopted and remixed by none other than Snoop Dogg on his promotional single \"Snoop Dogg Millionaire\". Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep seeks to further familiarize this new audience.\\n\\nWhile volume one of the Indie Culture series brought along a roster of emcees, volume two is production-centric, highlighting the work of over a dozen dubstep producers. To the newfound dubstep listener - I\\'ll admit, I\\'m one of them - Indie Culture Volume 2\\'s mixes are either hit or miss; thankfully, they\\'re mostly hit. Tracks like Chimpo\\'s remix of the haunting \"Cinema\" by the GZA and his son are eerily intensified by the sinister keys and the dark and sparse soundscapes played throughout. In such instances, the production creates a brand new setting, providing the vocals an alternative meaning to the original; in others, they re-sample original beats, putting an emphasis on dub remixing rather than remaking. The Scuba Scythe remix to \"Street Corners\", for example, retools the great Jean Plum sample from the original, crafting a bubbling, new interpretation that\\'s equally pleasing to the ears.\\n\\nUnlike the first entry in the Indie Culture series, Enter the Dubstep does not feature any new vocals. The album is a hodgepodge of verses and choruses from previously-released Wu-Tang and Wu-Tang affiliate albums like Raekwon and Icewater\\'s Polluted Water, Lord Jamar\\'s The 5% Album, Wisemen\\'s Wisemen Approaching, GZA\\'s Pro Tools, U-God\\'s Dopium and more (including volume one of the series). While it would have been nice to hear some new lyrics - especially by the main members of the Clan - it works out better this way since this collection is intended to primarily highlight the producers; as such, it\\'s gainful to compare and contrast the originals to the remixes.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that being a fan of Wu-Tang is not an assurance that you\\'ll enjoy this album. Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture Volume 2: Enter the Dubstep is very much like Linkin Park\\'s Reanimation in this regard. Open-mindedness is a pre-requisite, particularly for the untrained ear of the genre being tackled. Nineteen tracks deep, unless you\\'re a dubstep fan you may find yourself pressing the fast-forward button once every few or so tracks. But like Reanimation, the core content is still intact despite the altered sounds and backdrops.

The composition is played with a piano (or synthesizer?) with some electronic enhancement like reverb.  The surf is loud enough to fit well with the piano lead.  But by the third track, Storm, the CD begins to go off the rails.  The lead is a high pitched piano accompanied by strings.  The storm is essentially white noise in the background with an occasional wind gust that reminds my of a windy dry desert.  The fourth track, Thunder, is jarringly high pitched with strings, winds, and some piano interspersed with thunder.  The fifth track, Waterfall, brings back the piano/synthesizer? with reverb.  The waterfall sound is almost indistinguishable from white noise.  The score is played so slowly that the composition is just occasional high pitched random notes rather than a musical score.  The final track, jungle, brings back bird sounds and a high pitched piano with reverb.  The last four tracks are so jarring that they kept me awake rather than relaxed me.

His use of overdotting in the \"homophonic\" sections of the prelude and taking those recurring sections in a different tempo from the more overtly \"contrapuntal\" sections is both misleading and a misconception.  In the forte and piano alternating motifs near the beginning of the prelude, Biggs renders the three sixteenth notes leading into it as an eighth and two sixteenths, adopting an absurd \"seufzer\"-type two-note phrasing in his inimitable \"touch and go\" style of mostly sempre staccato playing, as Melville Smith long ago characterized it.\\n\\nThe fugue---really three fugues, each built upon the other and the last two being double fugues (the second is for the hands only)---suffers from Biggs\\' obliviousness to phrasing: the main subject, coincidentally resembling William Croft\\'s hymn tune \"St. Anne\" (it is doubtful if Bach knew this tune, which made its initial appearance some thirty-one years before this fugue was written), is broken up at (if memory serves) an upward leap of a fourth between B-flat and E-flat.  I suppose the best thing that can be said about this playing is that it\\'s accurate.  Biggs was fifty-eight years old at the time he made this recording, and the master tape was probably engineered by EPB himself (as were most of his recordings in what is now Adolphus Busch Hall). He was in the throes of rheumatoid arthritis, and often in the flesh was not capable of delivering the kind of performance you hear on this record.  The style of the first fugue (for five voices) always struck me as reminiscent of that of old choral motets, and there are many opportunities for approximating a choral sound on the organ in this piece----mostly a clean legato, opportunities for \"stretching\" (i.e., tempo rubato) and so on.  You will not hear any of this from Mr. Biggs.\\n\\nThe second fugue (manuals only, and challenging for even a seasoned player---if you want the piece to come across with the sense of voice-leading it deserves)---is chopped up and musical lines can only be extrapolated.  The last fugue is just notes.\\n\\nI should point out that Mr. Biggs made another recording of BWV 552 (in stereo) a few years earlier, on the much larger Schnitger organ at Zwolle, The Netherlands, restored by Flentrop.  It is still wanting, but he took the prelude at a single tempo in that version and (as I remember---I have not heard that record in over forty years) took an expansive approach to the work.  I have not heard Mr. Biggs\\' earlier recordings of this prelude and fugue (mono era)---but those would be interesting comparisons.\\n\\nIn his own liner notes, Biggs credits the coupling of the Prelude and the Fugue (which respectively open and close the third part of JSB\\'s \"Clavieruebung\", often called the \"Lutheran Organ Mass\") to Felix Mendelssohn.  Maybe.  It was Friedrich Griepenkerl, the first editor of the Peters edition of J.S. Bach\\'s complete organ works, who presented them that way in the third volume of that edition, and made the coupling stick.\\n\\nE. Power Biggs, for all his faults, was a unique figure in the history of organ performance.  He had guts, drive and imagination, and essentially created his own position.  He came to New York jobless and conspicuously lacking in funds, initially hoping to land a church position.  He contacted T. Tertius Noble, then music director at St. Thomas\\' Church in NYC, who found him an Episcopal job in Newport, R.I.  Biggs was eventually fired from that job --- it was assumed that, since he was an Englishman, he knew something about training boy choristers (he didn\\'t) and became disillusioned with the church.  Barbara Owen tells that story in her book \"E. Power Biggs, Concert Organist\".  Biggs took another church job in Cambridge, Mass., which remained his permanent home until he died.  He held that church job until the late 1950s, but rarely played services.  He started an ambitious series of recitals, and persuaded the curator of the Bush-Reisinger Museum at Harvard to install an experimental \"neoclassical\" organ built by Aeolian-Skinner in what was then called the Romanesque Hall. He initiated a series of live radio broadcasts from that hall.  Twenty-one years later, this instrument was replaced by the Flentrop heard in the recording under discussion here.  Sadly, the year 1958---which saw the installation of the famous Flentrop, a marvel of an expanded chamber organ---also saw the cancellation of the radio broadcasts and the onset of Biggs\\' arthritis, which he fought, as best he knew how, for the rest of his life.', 0, 0), ('Oh No.  i thought I was buying the whole 86 Chapters.

Although many consider this Village Vanguard session to be a classic, I found it boring.  So I was skeptical of this recording. Now, I treasure it.\\nIt was recorded in Japan in 1983.\\nMal has an unusual piano style, quite unique.  I won\\'t attempt to describe it, but suffice it to say it has elements of Monk, and many other pianists.  Mal\\'s music can be brooding.  The final cut on this CD \"Waltz For My Mother\" falls under the emotion of brooding, and is a lovely performance.\\nAnd drummer Ed Blackwell also has an unusual style.  He has taken what I call an old fashioned New Orleans drumming style and turned it to a style suitable to play in the legendary early recordings of Ornette Coleman, Dewey Redman and Don Cherry.  Go figure!  If you can explain how a Baby Dodds New Orleans style of drumming lends itself to the avant-garde, let me know.  At any rate, it works.  Ed\\'s bouncing, elegant rhythm fits in perfectly with Mal\\'s deliberate, searching note choices.\\nI don\\'t mean to neglect bassist Reggie Johnson.  He contributes fine accompianment, as well as good plucked and bowed solos.\\nThis CD is a swinging, but controlled interpretation of jazz standards such as \"Bag\\'s Groove,\" \"Billie\\'s Bounce,\" and \"Round Midnight.\"  There is great beauty contained herein.

The following is the correct  listing taken from the box.... additionally the cd's had no labeling on them at all so when  I had to transfer them to a holder I needed to  type up a list ... The factory packaging was large and unwieldy and the CDs were not very safely contained in their slips. They were very difficult to remove and even if the original package had been pristine I probably would not have kept them in it. The extra tape peeled off part of the label of one of my cds.

It\\'s almost as they\\'re trying to hard, with songs like \"Amplify,\" with some joker rapper spitting verses towards the end of the song. A rapper? In Jbb? It sounds as bad as it seems.\\n\\nOn top of this much more mainstream and at some points boring melodies, they also adopt common and overdone vocal lines, evident in \"Push some air.\" Just listen to the first verse, and you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about.\\nBut not all the songs are complete garbage. The songs I did enjoy were coincidentally the ones that sounded way too similar to previous classics. This is where \"Sky Juice\", \"Give yourself over\", and \"Zion triad\" fit nicely.\\nThe rest of the songs fit in the void of a combination of genres that just don\\'t work. Examples are \"So Aware\", which is a failed take of JBB trying to make a love song for teenagers to croon to each other, with the overuse of string instruments. \"Be at peace\" sounds like it was created for a Disney movie like Little Mermaid, when our two heroes fall in love.\\n\\nBashing aside, I would not recommend this album to any JBB fans who enjoy their more classic sound. \"Amplify\" strays far from the path, infusing more mainstream and gimmick sounding genres.', 0, 0), ('For over a decade, the American band John Brown\\'s Body has continued to refine and improve upon their authentic roots reggae sound with each of their previous five releases.  Their new CD `Amplify\\' contains diverse music that continues to direct this positive vibe in a fresh and exciting direction.  The 12 tracks on this release incorporate a myriad of influences ranging from toasting and psychadelia to dancehall, hip-hop and electronica. The instantly recognizable skank of reggae is still prominent throughout most of the tracks, but that usual format is altered, enhanced and cleverly rewoven into a unique sonic hybrid that almost defies categorization.\\n\\nElliot Martin, the bands lead singer and front man, possesses a distinctive voice that reveals itself in a multitude of vocalization techniques - powerful intonations and crisp, exact chatting can seamlessly flow into controlled intimacy or combine with his own splendid self-supporting back-up vocals.  His voice, blessed with a warm equalized tone, often is displayed utilizing controlled syllabic fluctuations which would make even the most confident verbalist jealous.  Mr. Martin is also the catalyst behind the well structured and conscious lyrics and he has shown increased confidence in his song craft that was evident on the 2002 release `Spirits All Around Us` and dominated on the excellent 2005 CD `Pressure Points.`\\n\\n`Speak of the devil\\' is  a sinister effort built upon a one-drop riddim that warns the listener to be more aware and reconfirms that the righteous shall always prevail regardless of any forms of opposition.  Vaughn Benjamin of the group Midnite contributes a patois-intense vocal towards the end of the track, nicely complimenting the concrete solid dub rhythms.  `Skyjuice,\\' perhaps the most imposing track on the release, is resplendent with intricately dense horns and tremendous groove-heavy beats from the always impressive drummer Tommy Benedetti.  `Ghost Notes,\\' infused with a heavy established skanking riff not heard since the days of early Aswad at their finest hour, is a mid-tempo reflective piece that pays due respect to the band\\'s former bass player Scott Palmer, who passed away a few years ago.  The lyrics are poignant and display an ardent compassion seldom found in contemporary song writing.  \" Gave with every note he played, we won\\'t be forgetful. \"\\n\\nWhile fundamentally faithful to the reggae vibe, John Browns Body creatively weaves rhythms and beats with layered instrumentation that provides a foundation for complex call and response vocals and splendid brass flourishes. The guitar work is tight and circulates amidst a variety of layered keyboard parts that act as a supportive framework throughout the songs.  Throughout the entire disc, innovative dub-friendly basslines enjoy enlightened interplay with crisp, bouncy drum beats.\\n\\nThe inclusion of exotic instrumentation such as the kora and violin take the galloping track `So Aware\\' outside the traditional reggae parameters to a subtle, worldly flavor echoing stylistic integrations used by North African Rai musicians.  Another contributing ingredient to the entire John Brown\\'s Body sound are the exception production techniques that meticulously meld the surfeit of rhythms and beats with rich instrumentation, detailed harmonization and an enveloping use of atmosphere.  The editing is stellar and the expressive arrangements are complete with unexpected twists.  Live soundman and studio producer Jason `Jocko\\' Randall polishes the bands current creations enhancing the cross pollination of numerous musical rhythmic styles.  The result is a new style of music that possesses a vibe always loyal to the mystic, earthly tones of roots reggae while being inventive, groove-heavy and cool.\\n\\nJohn Brown\\'s Body have established themselves as perhaps America\\'s most creative and dedicated reggae ensemble.  On `Amplify,\\' the latest incarnation of the band successfully executes a variety of moods that are ambitious and vibrantly experimental.  With the addition of new band members, Elliot Martin and Tommy Benedetti have embraced a new found sense of purpose and delivered a collection of compositions slightly ahead of its time.

After that I Molinari's interpretation sounds like they don't 'hear' the music, just play notes.\", 0, 0), ('I really hate giving a reduced rating, but I have to honestly say, this CD is a disappointment on several fronts.\\n\\nThe first problem is the anachronistic temperament (system of tuning).  It is a Renaissance-era tuning, from at least 100 years before Pachelbel, suited for music of one or two keys, and possibly a very few closely related keys, but certainly not for every key, or the wide variety of keys that Pachelbel (or anyone from his era) composed for.\\n\\nI was thinking this must be an organ built in the 1500s and tuned with a temperament of that era, which would sound authentic with music by, for example, Scheidt and Sweelinck.  One could certainly play next to nothing by J.S. Bach on such an organ, and little by Pachelbel for that matter.  Now is it possible Pachelbel may have encountered such an organ tuned that way in his lifetime?  Maybe, maybe, I\\'m not saying it wasn\\'t possible.  But I consider it highly doubtful he would have just sat down on played anything, in any key, on it.  He would have said, \\'Oh dear, one of these anciently tuned monstrosities, let us see if we can find a good program only in these complementary keys.\\'\\n\\nImagine my surprise to read the liner notes and find (A) no mention whatsoever of the (admittedly intricate) topic of temperament.  So the user is just left to wonder why the thing sounds so freakin\\' out-of-tune.  And more surprisingly ... (B) the organ is not from the 1500s at all, it was constructed in 1702.  OK, the shoe has dropped;  the temperament is simply wrong.  That was only 4 years before Pachelbel died;  it was during J.S. Bach\\'s teenage years when he was supposedly doing crazy things like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor and none of them were restricted to those vanilla keys.  I believe all church organs of era, certainly NEW church organs of the era which would attract great living composers and performers, were MUCH more oriented in mild temperaments that were friendly or at least usable in \"MOST\" keys.  I cannot accept this organ of the High Baroque being tuned in this manner.  MY OPINION!\\n\\nIf you want authenticity in old music, the instrument (and temperament) must match the composer\\'s ideal, not simply be \"OLD\".  Otherwise, it\\'s like taking a horse and buggy to the drive-thru window at the 1950\\'s burger joint.  Yes, historic, but totally the wrong time period.\\n\\nAnd in case anyone is wondering ... temperament is decided by the tuner, not the organ builder or rebuilder.  So, yes, FYI ... this tuning was set by the most recent tuner.  It could be made into modern equal temperament, or one of the \\'well-tempered\\' Baroque temperaments, by the NEXT tuner (with permission of the owner of course, which I hope they would give).  FYI.\\n\\nThe other problem with this CD is that it is played \"introspectively\" and very little joy or full-organ sound we are used to hearing from decades of other organ recordings.  Why that is, I can only speculate.  It was the organist\\'s decision.\\n\\nHere are a few thoughts on each track.\\n\\n(1) Toccata in E minor - does not sound good in this temperament.  Also, played delicately and with many registration changes.  This is a first year piece, quite easy and I would prefer to hear it played robustly, beginning to end.\\n\\n(2) Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ - in two sections.  The first is not ideal in this temperament, but tolerable.  The second is very sweet indeed.  The music is very simple, I have played it at Lutheran funerals.\\n\\n(3) Wir glauben all\\' an einen Gott - This has a highly decorated chorale melody, making it undiscernable (to me at least).  Of course, that is Pachelbel\\'s doing, not the organist\\'s.  I appreciate he is playing it strongly and at a clippy tempo.  This one does not suffer much from the temperament.\\n\\n(4) Wie schoen leuchtet der Morgenstern - This will be one of the few hymn tunes possibly recognizable by a modern (Lutheran) churchgoer:  O Morning Star, How Fair and Bright.  It is delicately played and easily recognizable.  The temperament is not a detriment.\\n\\n(5) An Wasserflussen Babylon - OK.\\n\\n(6) Fantasia in G minor - Temperament sounds OK in this key.  I would have preferred a little more aggressiveness, it is played introspectively.\\n\\n(7) Ein feste Burg - A Mighty Fortress.  Without a doubt the most recognizable hymn arrangement on this CD, and indeed what I bought the CD for.  This is the piece I played on 500th Reformation day in church last Sunday.  I am sorry to say, the temperament does not do this piece credit--it simply sounds like a neglected, out-of-tune organ.  Or at best, one which Pachelbel would have said, \\'Sorry, it looks like we can\\'t use this particular organ for this particular piece\\' ... in my opinion.  Also I am disappointed it is not played very joyfully.\\n\\n(8) Chaconne in D minor.  Temperament OK but again not played with much fire.\\n\\n(9) Allein Gott in der Hoh sei Ehr - How about a nice little single 8 and 2 for a change?\\n\\n(10) Fugue in D minor.  The chromatic step-wise fugue subject shows precisely why we need a more equal-tempered or at least well-tempered tuning to perform Pachelbel.\\n\\n(11) Toccata in F.  Once again, far too restrained, although the temperament sounds good here.\\n\\n(12) Nun lob, mein Seel\\', den Herren - OK.\\n\\n(13) Toccata in C minor.  I have just figured it out.  He must have been playing at 1:00 AM and didn\\'t want to disturb the neighbors.\\n\\n(14) Werde munter, mein Gemute.  Another one of the rare hymn tunes which may be likely recognized by lay people today.  OK, I do not expect fireworks on this piece.\\n\\n(15) Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her.  Another better-known Christmas hymn, \"From Heaven Above\", which may be familiar to many traditional parishioners ... although not saying it is normally played from Kmart speakers during Christmas season :) Now, get this:  AARGH!  The one piece I would like to hear gently and introspectively, THIS is where he decides to pull all the stops and play full organ.  (It is a conspiracy against me! :)\\n\\n(16) Meine Seele erhebt der Herren - not familiar with this piece, sounds OK.\\n\\n(17) Magnificat Fugue Sexti Toni - At last, another fugue played joyfully, high time!\\n\\n(18) Prelude in D minor - Especially as a closing piece of a recital, he had the opportunity to turn this into a blazing ball of fire, and instead was very careful and conservative.\\n\\nNote, I mentioned the Lutheran religion several times and only because my first organ job was at a Lutheran church and I have an affinity for those chorales.  Very few of them are done at the other various Protestant churches ....\\n\\nThere is not a great deal of Pachelbel organ music recorded but there are several others available which I own and can highly recommend:\\n\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Gerd-Wachowski/dp/B0000021H9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Gerd Wachowski</a>&nbsp;- most highly recommended, stunning recording\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Werner-Jacob/dp/B00000DP64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Werner Jacob</a>\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Joseph-Payne/dp/B01K8LP0MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Joseph Payne</a>&nbsp;- on a fine little organ I have spent some time with :)\\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mary-Jane-Newman/dp/B00000J8E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mary Jane Newman</a>&nbsp;- complete Fugues on the Magnificat', 0, 0), ('I own this CD and \"Johnny Has Gone for a Soldier\" is hauntingly beautiful.

Check out the songs of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook in a whole new light - it is a fabulous listen!  (The 4-CD album is ONLY available from the Burning Sky Records website).\\n\\nReleased in 1977, the John Cale-produced U.K. Squeeze introduced the world to the magic of Squeeze.  The album presented Squeeze at their wildest - they had an edge to their sound that was unique to this record.\\n\\nCovering an album like U.K. Squeeze would be a challenge.  We strove to capture the wild abandon of the original album while giving fresh life to each of its songs.  Here\\'s a brief take on the tracks, with some thoughts from the bands/artists themselves:\\n\\n1.) Sex Master - After a gorgeous, Jellyfish-esque opening, US band Steve Sizemore Group rocks the heck out of the album opener, with guitar, piano and Hammond organ all \"rocking it out like the world was coming to an end.\"\\n\\n2.) Bang Bang - UK band Keshco provides a fun, quirky take on the song, \"playing up the whimsy in the verses and the yearning in the choruses,\" with a \"funk-out at the end\" to \"top off all that pent-up frustration.\"\\n\\n3.) Strong In Reason - US artist Christopher Watson provides an updated New Wave take on the track.  \"What started out sweet and tentative became edgy, taut, and mechanical,\" Chris says. The track also features cool angular guitar from Trees\\' Dane Conover.\\n\\n4.) Wild Sewerage Tickles Brazil - Japanese band Penny and Ashtray take a surreal approach to the album\\'s lone instrumental - they strove to \"represent the song\\'s alter ego in a parallel world.\"  Their cover has all of the delicious creepiness of the original version.\\n\\n5.) Out Of Control - Speaking of \"creepiness,\" US band Trees amps up the creepiness appropriate to the lyric while at the same time making a very catchy cover.  Trees\\' Dane Conover wanted listeners to have \"little beads of sweat trickle down their forehead\" when listening to this one.\\n\\n6.) Take Me I\\'m Yours - US band (by way of England) Sartre\\'s Lobster give this classic Squeeze track a decidedly Middle Eastern feel, using the song\\'s \"lyrics about bellydancers, camels and the Golden East\" as a starting point, swirling with a \"a kind of \\'70s, vaguely Led Zeppelin-esque vibe.\"\\n\\n7.) The Call - US band Robert Mag & The Number Nine put a powerful, Bowie-esque slant on this track, rocking it up more than the original version - very cool stuff.\\n\\n8.) Model - UK band The Slingsby Hornets amp up the energy on this track, employing \"a Brian May multi layered guitar feel, over a 90s influenced Redd Kross style powerpop/glam backing, with the addition of a few analogue synth sounds.\"\\n\\n9.) Remember What - Spanish (by way of the US) artist Amelia Ray considered numerous potential approaches to the song, \"but the funk won out\" on this inspired cover. The majority of the song is sung in 7/8 time, with the bridges switching to 4/4.  It is funky indeed!\\n\\n10.) First Thing Wrong - US band Ocean of Algebra \"took a very loose and open approach to the song, and \"ended up getting kind of an Ocean of Algebra does the New York Dolls does Squeeze type of sound.\"  Singer Jim Hiskey\\'s vocal is not to be missed!\\n\\n11.) Hesitation (Rool Britannia) - US artist D A Karkos takes what I always felt was a so-so song from U.K. Squeeze and turns it into something amazing. Karkos says, \"My approach to this song was pretty simple. I wanted to make it more of a hard rock song and less of a jam. Slowing the down the tempo and coming up with a new riff that worked over the original chord progression seemed to do the trick.\"  I\\'ll say!  This cover is flat-out sick!\\n\\n12.)

Put Off Procrastination\\n3.  Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\\n\\n- Did these three recordings alone change everything? No.\\n\\n- Did they start me, and then keep me, on a path I was previously unlikely to take or stay on without them? Yes!\\n\\n- Had I tried similar recordings, such as hypnosis and books, to accomplish the same things, and did Emery\\'s recordings prove by far the most effective? Yes!\\n\\nAt the time of this writing, September 17, 2015, I have never met nor communicated with Michael J. Emery. This testimonial comes from the influence of the recordings themselves, listened to over a period of about a year.\\n\\nThe two elements I believe stand these recordings out from others like them are:\\n\\n1) The music and sound effects that accompany Emery\\'s verbal instructions and imagery. The music is, in my experience, simultaneously relaxing and stimulating. In fact, listening intently, fully conscious, to each of these recordings and their instructions at least twice is an excellent way to learn how to call upon their techniques during a normal workday without the recordings.\\n\\n2) The most effective image/sound effect for me personally, in any audio recording I\\'ve ever listened to, is an \"ice cube\" metaphor on \"Complete Confidence 2.0\" designed to gather, freeze, and put away all thoughts of previous failure, so that I could proceed building confidence without mental hang-ups from the past. My unconscious truly responded to this metaphor.\\n\\nWith these recordings, I was able to build \"Complete Confidence\" in a way I had not been able to sustain before under pressure.\\n\\nThis prompted me to \"Put Off Procrastination\" and act on a number of decisions I had waffled over before, which prompted me within a short time to seek out and then join a public speaking club which I still belong to, and led me soon after to apply for promotion to a leadership position I had not fully seized the first time it had come around, increasing my income significantly.\\n\\nFor those with a \"fear of success\" similar to what I felt for many years before seeking out and listening to these recordings, I won\\'t lie to you - bold decisions lead to responsibilities that can be difficult to stick with once assumed. \"Sheer Resolve To Do What It Takes\" kept me on the path, bolstered me in refusing to give up, and kept me focused on thriving rather than just \"getting through\" challenging situations.\\n\\n\"Complete Confidence\" continued to bolster that indispensable element, and \"Put Off Procrastination\" continued to provide tangible effects that prompted me to act on, and drive steadily to completion (or lead others steadily to completion), important tasks that had lost momentum but still needed to be done.', 1, 1), ('was free...', 0, 0), ('I like these various artists collections - very smart to offer it free.

I see it is already attached to La Boheme, and Lord knows where else, by Amazon.  It is their doing, not mine.  Now about this Traviata ...\\n\\nI am a big fan of Jan Peerce and particularly regretful of the fact I didn\\'t go hear him live, although I had the chance staring me in the eyes and stepping on my toes.  It was about 1980 and he was doing Traviata at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  I was all dressed up and ready to go, and then I read a review in the paper which said it was ridiculous to have a 76-year-old Alfredo hobbling around the stage with a cane.  And so, because I was stupid, I thought, oh dear--I don\\'t want anyone to see me there, if the reviewer thought it was bad.  And so I missed out.  Now he is dead, and the moral of the story is:  don\\'t be stupid, and miss out.\\n\\nWell, this particular recording is interesting in a way, but mostly because it\\'s surprisingly mundane.  Peerce is Peerce, he does a great job, but there\\'s nothing shocking or new.  If you have Toscanini, then you have Peerce (in much better sound).\\n\\nLet us put to rest the very pleasant myth that everything that came from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera, during the Golden Age, was automatically a masterpiece.  This is without a doubt the scrappiest (note the politically-expedient leading \\'s\\' on my chosen adjective) Traviata ever to come from a leading house.  The conducting is uninspired, to put it charitably.  The tempos are mostly S-L-O-O-W-W, and it is simple time-beating.  Now when I say \\'mostly\\' slow, that implies that some of it is not slow.  That is true.  The Dr. scene is the most hurried Dr. scene ever to grace wax.  This guy was REALLY late to a golf appointment, or maybe he had to go to the little boy\\'s room.  Whatever it was, he had to get the heck outa there, FAST.\\n\\nAbout the Violetta, who I have never heard of (not that that means anything).  She is labeled as a soprano, but I swear has the beautiful, well-rounded voice of a mezzo.  And guess what else?  She doesn\\'t do any top notes.  Have you ever heard a Violetta who avoided the top notes?  I\\'m not saying it\\'s bad, but certainly is unusual.  There is something else a little different.  She uses some different words.  In Fors\\'e lui, she doesn\\'t sing \"Gioir! Gioir!\", she sings \"Aaaaaah! Aaaaah!\"  And there are other words she uses in certain areas, but I don\\'t know what they are.  That is certainly different.\\n\\nAltogether it is an unsettling Violetta and I will have to say, if she could sing Violetta at the Met, so frankly could any of the talented ladies singing Violetta at community opera I know with no apologies whatsoever.\\n\\nLawrence Tibbett is father Germont, and I am sure you are aware he is one of the greatest baritones of the 20th century.  He is giving it everything he has, and it actually detracts.  Yes, I am afraid it is an odd mix to put him in this mediocre production.  It is like having a New York Steak with potato chips and diet orange soda on the side.\\n\\nThe score has been cut, of course.  The standard cuts are taken, and then some.  Even the parts of the two messengers (\\'La signora e partita\\', and \\'Una dama d\\'un cocchio\\') are cut.  Alfredo just asks who\\'s there, then proceeds to read the letter.  So you are telling me at the Metropolitan Opera they didn\\'t have anyone who could take these 10-second messenger parts?\\n\\nNow about the sound.  The sound is very good for the age, up until the last act.  Of course, it is not as good as Toscanini of 1946, but then again, nothing of that era is.  It\\'s certainly as good as, actually better than, the live Callas Traviatas of 15 years later.  Then beginning the last act, there is an annoying series of ticks or bumps that won\\'t go away.  When it first starts, one might say it\\'s not too bad.  But it goes on the whole act, and it strains the limits of tolerability.\\n\\nSo the good stuff here is Peerce as Alfredo, which can be best enjoyed with Toscanini, and Tibbett as Germont, which is better enjoyed with Ponselle.  The rest of it is altogether \\'meh\\'.  Of course, it is cheap, but the question is, do you want to spend the time and sanity when there are SO MANY truly excellent Traviatae out there??', 0, 0), ('Great Mardi Gras song!

One of the wonderful things about this talented duo is how seamlessly they can blend these, sometimes within an individual song, into a viable whole that is simply great music that not only touches the soul of listeners, but brings nourishment to their minds as well...not to mention inducing them to a good bit of foot-tapping in the process...and the urge to dance.\\n\\nSeven out of the eleven tunes on this album are Mark Viator originals, and they clearly illustrate what a fine writer he is.  He's also a very talented guitarist - almost all of the guitar work on the recording is Mark's.  Whether he's fingerpicking or flatpicking, or playing slide, it's always masterful and appropriate, and never showy for the sake of it - it's all about the music and what supports it best and conveys the mood.  When Mark shifts from accompanying lyrics to adding a spot of lead, the seamlessness is wonderful to behold.  If you're fortunate enough to see them perform live (which we do every chance we get), you'll understand this even more. The songs here that were written by others (Thad Beckman, Robert Earl Keen, Kate Wolf and Hank Williams) are as well-chosen as the originals are well-written, and suit Mark and Susan to a T.\\n\\nMark's Cajun heritage is never far from the surface.  `Queen of the bayou' is a heartfelt tribute to his grandmother, a tasty stew of memories and love.  `Ain't goin back' is an honest look at the life of a proud Louisiana working man, a vivid picture of resilience and devotion to family.  `Dharma bums', as one might gather from the title, was inspired by Jack Kerouac's novel, and wonders eloquently if the idealism the book inspired in many of us when we read it the first time can be carried and kept alive as our lives move along.  Susan's voice carries Mark's original `These arms' to sweet heights - it's a beautiful love song, extremely moving, and one you'll find yourself humming it before you realize it.  Her renditions of Kate Wolf songs (`Across the Great Divide' appears here), as well as those of country legends such as Hank Williams (`I'm so lonesome I could cry' gets a beautiful reading on this album) and Patsy Cline (if you're lucky enough to see them perform, ask for `Walkin after midnight'), are all nothing short of wonderful, and Robert Earl Keen's `I would change my life' illustrates that she can give new life to more contemporary songs.  She makes everything she sings her own, reaching down into her artist's soul to color them with shades from her own palette.  When the two of them blend their voices, the harmonies are perfect and the chemistry is intimate - you can get a sense of it from just listening, but again, seeing them perform in a live setting makes it abundantly clear that they love what they're doing.\\n\\nMany of Austin's finest musicians lend their talents to this recording.  It never feels over-crowded, rather like a conversation among good friends, where everyone has something to contribute but no one attempts to dominate.  Every track flows easily along, without production getting in the way of the material.  As I said earlier, this is simply great music - well-written, performed with heart and talent, and a complete joy to experience.  Pass it up at your peril.  I don't think I'm allowed to insert a link to their website here, but if you do a search for them, you'll find it - there are samples available there, and you'll hear what I mean.  If you like what you hear - and if you enjoy great music, I feel sure you will - check out Mark's earlier solo album BAYOU TCHE, filled with more finely-crafted original songs (one co-written by another great Austin-based songwriter, Slaid Cleaves), and his solo acoustic guitar offering WIRE & WOOD, showcasing his instrumental talents.

All of this in less than 12 months.\\n\\nDuring this remarkable year, the 9 weeks between 2/9/1784 and 4/12/1784 stand out, transcending mere fecundity:\\n\\nFebruary 9, 1784: Mozart completes the Eb Piano Concerto K.449\\nMarch 15, 1784: Mozart completes the Bb Piano Concerto K.450\\nMarch 22, 1784: Mozart completes the D Major Piano Concerto K.451\\nMarch 30, 1784: Mozart completes the Quintet for Piano and Winds in Eb, K.452\\nApril 12, 1784: Mozart completes the G Major Piano Concerto K.453\\n\\nThis is astonishing - some might even say miraculous - even for Mozart. In recent years many scholars and musicians - particularly of the HIP variety - have sought to demystify Mozart, to knock him down a peg or two. Musicologists have been keen to point out his flaws and seem obsessed with the prosaic details of his life and work, and HIP practitioners have endeavored to bring Mozart \"down to earth\" with roughed-up, sweaty, ugly sounding performances. The goal seems to be to endlessly remind us that Mozart a mere mortal. The Zeitgeist commands that we scoff at notions of divine inspiration. Mozart was nothing more, the musicologists tell us, than a very clever man.\\n\\nYet when we listen to the music we know better. And in spite of their ongoing efforts to mortalize Mozart, no musicologist has been able to sufficiently address the miracle of 1784. How did Mozart do it? How could any man create no less than 5 masterpieces in less than 9 weeks? It is one of the great mysteries of the universe, and one that no scholar, no matter how learned, will ever be able to answer - just as physicists will never be able to explain the deepest questions of existence.\\n\\nThis recording is a hidden gem of the catalogue. It pairs Walter Klien - one of the keenest Mozarteans who ever lived - with Stanislaw Skrowaczewski (SS) and the Minnesota Orchestra. Klien\\'s way with this music is wonderfully idiomatic. His instrument of choice was a Bosendorfer Imperial, which allows for fortepiano-like transparancy without the hideous sonorities associated with period instruments. Klien is a master of legato - each note sparkles, but his touch is percussive enough to make Mozart\\'s keyboard lines both sing and dance.\\n\\nAs a \"B\" label, Vox employed some scruffy regional ensembles - some not much more than pickup bands - to record the Mozart Concertos with Klien (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mozart-Complete-Solo-Piano-Concertos-The-Voxbox-Edition/dp/B009T2XPC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mozart: Complete Solo Piano Concertos (The Voxbox Edition)</a>&nbsp;In the 60\\'s and 70\\'s he was paired with the Mainzer Kammerorchester with Gunter Kehr (K.414, K.456, K.467), the Pro Musica Orchester Wien & Paul Angerer (k. 449), the Wiener Volksoperorchester with Peter Maag (K.451, K.488, K.491, K.537). In each of these recordings (none of which have been remastered to date) Klien shines, but the B-grade orchestras sound sour and rough. Whether that is more a function of poor engineering than the artistic shortcomings of the ensembles, we cannot know. Either way, it is a shame - considering Klien\\'s immense talent - that these recordings sound as rough and harsh as they do.\\n\\nThankfully, we at least have this disc, the only Mozart Concerto performances featuring Klien in which the orchestra and sound engineering rise to the occasion. In K.453, SS leads the Minnesotans in spirited readings of the outer movements, and the Andante is full of such exquisite beauty and refinement that it qualifies as a \"postcard from Cythera\" (as reviewer BO\\'H would say!). Klien\\'s playing of the Andante cadenza is deeply contemplative - and on his Bosendorfer, we get to luxuriate in those deep bass notes. SS\\'s crisply articulated Rondo is a joy - both Klien and the ensemble impart a sparkling vitality to the Presto interlude at 5:20. This Presto interlude is one of Mozart\\'s best surprises, and a archetypal example of what makes Mozart Mozart. Overall, there is an abundance of energy in play here, and happily, a lot of it is supplied by the Minnesotans.\\n\\nK.595 has long been a subject of debate. Today\\'s musicologists sneer at the notion that Mozart intended it as a farewell; accordingly, the HIP movement usually deprives their readings of this concerto of any sense of valediction. While the musicologists may be right, the HIP practitioners are surely wrong to play K.595 prosaically.\\n\\nWhether Mozart realized it or not, the Bb Concerto he completed on January 14, 1791 is indeed his farewell to the genre. Alfred Einstein argued passionately that Mozart seemed to have a premonition about his fate; while we may never know if this is really true, the music itself tells us that Einstein may have been right after all.\\n\\nRight from the start, the cellos and basses underline the Allegro with a sense of gravity. The happy tunes that follow are thus tinged with sadness - the sun is shining, but for the last time - and this signals that Klien and the Minnesotans see K.595 as more than just another item in the Koechel catologue, its status as the final piano concerto being something more than mere coincidence.\\n\\nAny doubt one might have about the valedictory nature of this work is removed in the Larghetto - a vision of eternity - and Klien and the Minnesotans play it with a wistfulness that makes the heart ache. The Rondo, playful and childlike - a longing for the days of innocence - is sweet, charming, innocent, and sad. Arthur Hutchings wrote that \"the sun never sets on any of Mozart\\'s four piano concertos in Bb\" - this is undoubtedly true, but in K.595, twilight is nigh.\\n\\nThis pairing is serendipitous. The sound is good, and the performances are brilliant. Marvel at the miracle of 1784. For 62 enchanted days, time let Mozart \"hail and climb / Golden in the heydays of his eyes...\"\\n\\n\"...

For outstanding performances, look for Fritz Reiner's 1960 recording of the excerpts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Antal Dorati's recording with the Concertgebouworkest, and Gergiev's recording with the Kirov Orchestra (now the Mariinsky Theater Symphony Orchestra). But keep in mind that Reiner's reading is approached as symphonic concert, so expect quick an quirky tempos. On the other hand, Dorati's reading is a lot more sterile and steady. All in all, Reiner and Dorati's readings are performed with such precision it makes Tilson Thomas's recording sound like a High School Band. It's a pity, because Tilson Thomas has some magnificent recordings out there (Beethoven's Late Choral Works with the London Symphony Orchestra), but this just isn't one of them.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a more recent recording, I strongly suggest Sir Simon Rattle's recording with the Berlin Philharmonic.

It occurs to me that if Chopin were alive today, he might compose something like this. I also really love \"Cold Steps,\" a dark, very introspective piece that comes from deep within, expressing a profound sadness that takes your breath away. \"Melody of Autumn\" is much lighter and has a  swirling energy. \"Nobody Knows\" is a lovely ballad that seems to be telling a story - perhaps a shared secret. \"The Last Smile of You\" conveys the feeling of tragic loss. Mournfully sad yet elegant and graceful, this is another favorite. \"The Cafe at 25 O\\'Clock\" is quite different from the other tracks, with jazz chords and playful keyboard runs that show another side of this gifted artist. \"End of a Dream\" ends the album with a light-hearted waltz that dances around the piano with its charming melody and then ends abruptly at just the right moment.\\n\\nBehdad Bahrami is a really impressive new artist who just might be on the brink of an international music career.

At first his name was not mentioned, but people got interested and started asking questions about the unidentified artist. From then on his career flourished.  Polache went on to have his own tv show \"De Troba con Polache\", in which he visited various places in Honduras.\\n\\nAt some point Polache got financial help from an artist support program created by the couped president Manuel Zelaya.

It seems we\\'re able to pick up where we left off with Mythomusic or The Garden with the dreamy mystical sounds on this album. The delicate layers of ambient music are presented across well over an hour in this fantasy world and eleven tracks for a nice full body of work.\\n\\nThe album starts off with a rich and dreamy mixture of ambient textures in \"Forest Heartbeat\" and also with the follow-up piece \"True Spirit of Nature\" for over fourteen minutes of beautiful, lush dreamscapes. At this point we\\'re launched into a little more up-beat chill-out style with \"Samhain Ecstasy\" and even more of a harsher tone with some grinding guitars (still in a new age style) on \"Sancta Inquisitio\". This uptempo rhythm carries on somewhat further into \"Druids Trance\", appropriately named for it\\'s trance-like rhythms and electronic loops. At this point we get to a definite favorite of mine in \"My Beloved Loneliness\", with a little more of a classical style with more organic sounding instruments taking the forefront over the interwoven tapestries of the melancholy backdrop. \"Ritual of Love\" follows in similar light with a little bit more of a ritual sound as the name implies with some percussion and various hypnotic rhythms and loops. \"Earth Prayer\" is another excellent ambient ethereal piece with angelic vocals gliding over the entrancing music as we drift along into the upbeat trance-like piece \"Beltane Moon\". The soaring synths and moving, but very New Age rhythms and beats move us into another sweet, dreamy track \"Bewitched by the Faeries\". This eight minute track drifts along slowly and hypnotically, setting the stage for eight-minute finale \"Wisdom of Trees\". Ambient, whispering tendrils gently carress the listener in this soft, dreamy piece with it\\'s subtle, layered soundscapes providing a backdrop for a siren song, luring the listener in and holding them entranced and trapped for the duration as the album slowly and softly drifts to a close.\\n\\nOver all the album is firmly rooted in the New Age style, something I\\'ve mentioned before we don\\'t normally feature and review here on Gothic Paradise. However, there is just enough of the lush, ethereal and darker, dreamier ambient styles that take the listener into a beautiful dream-like fantasyland that has always caught my attention. As you listen to our ethereal radio show and a Psicodreamics track comes on, it just fits well within the hauntingly beautiful ambient realm, even with the touch of chill-out New Age styles. This album fits right in that mold as we drift from one piece to another, through the ebbing and flowing of the lush layers from smooth ambient synths to a little more pronounced styles and more upbeat rhythms.

And also donating proceeds to the relief process.\\n\\nLike other recent AKB48 CD singles, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" has been released in 5 versions.  A regular and limited Type A, Type B editions (limited editions come with an event ticket) and the theater edition (which includes the first two tracks that come with the other two TYPE\\'s, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" and \"Kimi no Senaka\" but comes with second C/w song by Team 4 and KISS titled \"Tsubomitachi\" and no DVD).  Also, Type A and Type B will have different c/w songs.\\n\\nAnd once again, in a time where CD sales are lower than ever in Japan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" became the fifth million selling CD single for the group and going to show that AKB48s popularity is the real deal!\\n\\nThe version I will be reviewing is the regular edition Type-B featuring Mayu Watanabe, Yuki Kashiwagi and Minama Takahashi on the cover and the songs featured in the Type-B edition are \"Kaze wa Futeiru\", \"Kimi no Senaka\", \"Gondola Lift\".  The limited edition Type B comes with a random photo (there are a total of 18 available) and comes with a serial number to access a site for voting a song to be performed at AKB48s Request Hour Setlist Best 100 2012 concert and a promotional for their 2012 box calendar.\\n\\nAs for the CD single, \"Kaze wa Futeiru\" is a positive song of how people in despair, should have hope, should search for the light. Also, a song about rebuilding for the future and for one to continue living. How love and hope will continue and that the wind will continue to blow into the future.\\n\\nMy first time listening to the song and I was instantly hooked.  The melody was captivating and I loved the harmony among the various members performing the song.  But the positive message of hope is what I enjoyed most about this song.\\n\\nThe second song \"Kimi no Senaka\" (which translates to \"Back to you\") is performed by the Undergirls (these are the members of the group who were ranked #22-#30 in the AKB48 senbatsu elections, who get to perform the c/w song).  The song is upbeat and continues the AKB48 happy, upbeat idol style.  While the song is catchy and a fun song to listen to, the lyrics are actually quite sad as it revolves around loving someone but that person not noticing you.  And one yearning to be noticed.\\n\\nThe third track is \"Gondola Lift\" and is performed by Undergirls Yurigumi.  For this single, the Undergirls was split into three groups with Baragumi performing \"Vamos\", while Yurigumi performed \"Gondola Lift\".  The slow ballad is about being a couple, in love and being together with hearts as one and growing old together and also dying together.  A touching song!\\n\\nThe three tracks that round out the single are the off-vocal versions of each song, which are pretty much the music no vocal tracks.\\n\\nAs for the DVD, the DVD comes with a total of five tracks.\\n\\nThe first music video is for \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" as AKB48 tries to revive this tree-like being by freeing it from its captivity.  Also, a dance portion featuring the group dancing.  In terms of the music video, for set design, this is probably an interesting video as it has this tribalistic style to it, with the tree-being almost reminding me a of Studio Ghibli character.  As for costume design, the costumes are quite subdued compared to other AKB48 costume design but I liked the choreography on a dirt like setting and seeing the dirt flow while the group is dancing.  Overall, a good video.\\n\\nThe second music video is for \"Kimi no Senaka\" and has more dialogue and features friends who get into a discussion about a guy they like, while another friend is moving away.  Like the lyrics to the song itself, it\\'s happy and upbeat but also a hint of sadness as well.\\n\\nThe third music video is for \"Gondola Lift\" and this video is actually my favorite video on the entire DVD.  Not only is the song beautiful and touching, the music video shows what is behind the windows of an apartment building and we see an elderly man taking care of his sick wife, a family eating dinner and a young couple with a young woman who wants to marry her boyfriend.\\n\\nThe fourth music video is the \"DANCE! DANCE! DANCE! version of \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\", so no mystical creature is featured.  It\\'s all dancing!\\n\\nAnd the final fifth music video is the \"Tokuten eizo AKB48 conte Taxi-hen\" featuring a comedy skit with Mariko Shinoda as a taxi driver and Yuki Kashiwagi as a passenger.  The skit revolves around a taxi driver who talks too much.\\n\\nOverall, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is a wonderful and enjoyable CD single from AKB48.  While there are the different versions available for fans who may prefer certain singles showcasing their favorite performer, I personally chose this CD+DVD single because of its inspirational songs.  \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru\" is an inspirational song but \"Gondola Lift\" was a fantastic and touching Undergirls track with a music video that was just equally enjoyable.\\n\\nBut all tracks on this CD single showcase a nice balance of music from AKB48 as well as its DVD.\\n\\nOnce again, I\\'m pretty impressed with what Yasushi Akimoto has done with AKB48 and how hard these young ladies have come since 2005.  This is another addictive CD single and if you are an AKB48 fan, \"Kaze wa Fuiteiru (Type-B)\" is highly recommended!', 1, 1), ('Live version is not at all pleasing to my ears at all.

As the two experienced musicians from Boston genially converse in an improvisational style, there are many musical moods created. Their second album release in less than a year, Battstone and Poole now feel that they have solidified their musical direction with additional maturity and an element of playfulness. They state, \"Mystery and suspense, call and response, have become more refined and our musical Voice has emerged.\" I find their articulate expressions to be quite dreamlike and perfect for easy-listening or meditative contemplation.\\n\\nBoth jazz musicians display an affinity for the avant-garde, and they\\'re carving personalized identities as an amalgamation of their personal influences. For pianist Pat Battstone, we hear a personality that seems to incorporate styles of Marilyn Crispell, Keith Jarrett, Bobo Stenson, Charlie Banacos and Bill Evans. As far as vibraphonists go, I hear elements of Teddy Charles and Gary Burton (whose \"Dreams So Real\" album might have been inspirational). Originally from Ohio, Battstone attended the Berklee College of Music in 1973. He\\'s done a great deal of solo and ensemble work, as well as teaching, producing and recording. Battstone doesn\\'t just play the piano\\'s keys. He may pluck the strings to produce overtones, or he may employ hammers directly to the strings. At present, he also works as a rocket scientist at Draper Labs in Cambridge, Ma.\\n\\nRichard Poole also has a long resume with many years as a professional musician.

After hoping for an album like this, what a triumph, what a relief!\\n\\nAlthough the band takes more of a back seat, there are none the less some most excellent supporting musicians - Sam Martin on drums and percussion,  Greg Stoddard on lap steel (even more rewarding in a live situation), the fine Danny Keane on cello and Danny Thompson on double bass.\\n\\nAs suggested by the title, What the Night Delivers, is in many respects music made for the dark, the quiet, the solitary long drive on night-time country roads - not an album to get them out and dancing in the aisles, and thank goodness for that.\\n\\nThere are tantalising echoes of the first album Passing Stranger - not just in the atmosphere, but some of the structures, perhaps not quite so overt this time, but still there - the almost-tracks such as at the very start before Myself Again and once more the last minute of Bad Apple leading into So Long, My Moonlight -  musical cameos, perfect in their own way but also creating a little more space and air between songs.\\n\\nAlso in evidence is the Indian influence of before - notably in the beautiful walking Home in the Rain, but fleeting glimpses elsewhere in rhythms and intervals, the tabla on Bad Apple for instance.\\n\\nTo my mind there is not a weak track here, but that doesn't mean that there aren't a few particular stand-out tracks, for me these include Ballerina Lake, Head First into Paradise, Echoes of the Lonely, the aforementioned Walking Home in the Rain.\\n\\nThe album gives off the same vibe that you get from Scott's more intimate and stripped back shows (such as the two Wolverhampton shows at Newhampton Arts  - in 2011  and 2009 ). These are personal and direct, uncluttered by unnecessary effects and additions, and similarly here on this album everything has a place and a purpose. A joy and delight form start to finish, anyone yet to catch him live should make the effort for the dates in the autumn, you cannot fail to be impressed. I hope Mr M doesn't mind but below I have popped my own little vid of The Man Who Had Everything from the Wolverhampton show just recently - apologies for the light level - should he not want it here I will happily remove, but it does give a hint of how the new material comes over live.\", 1, 1), ('excellent lp', 1, 1), ('I actually got this by mistake.

It\\'s just this performance and recording that are awful, and I already described the reasons why in a 2009 review under Amazon\\'s other entry for this recording:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Alarico/dp/B001U1L9ZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Alarico</a>. However, I\\'ve been prompted to take a fresh look at it, and of course to do some more listening, after the sudden recent appearance of two glowing five-star reviews, appearing on both this and the other product page (although in the latter case, I see, they have both been deleted again at the same time today, February 18th 2015), praising this recording in similar and very fulsome terms.\\n\\nThose two reviews were posted by reviewers Magda Levi and Yoav Rothberger, both gilding the lily by adding admiring comments on each other\\'s work. (Stop press: since reading the rest of this, they\\'ve now changed their Amazon names to \\'ML\\' and \\'A Customer\\' respectively. Hang on - now they\\'ve both deleted their reviews on this page as well, and all their other Amazon reviews!) I\\'ll avoid commenting on the details of the latter\\'s review directly - firstly because, apart from the last paragraph, all the rest has been copied word for word from an entry by Bruno Belli on the website of Luca Casagrande, director and singer in this recording, so there isn\\'t really anything plausible or significant by Mr. Rothberger himself to comment on. Secondly, that reviewer evidently doesn\\'t take kindly to anyone expressing an opinion different from his own, but prefers to resort to ill-mannered language and personal insults to try to prove his point - as could be seen from the comments after the first review I wrote, again on the other product page cited above, although he has since deleted those comments. And thirdly, Mr. Rothberger appears to have a small claque of baroque music enthusiasts at his disposal, who are happy to vote in support of all his comments and to class as unhelpful any comments by anybody else - all, as if by magic, within just a few minutes of the comments being posted. Perhaps a similar fate awaits the present review!\\n\\nThis leaves me with Magda Levi\\'s review, which contains substantial passages copied word for word, without any acknowledgment, from Chapter 8 of Professor Colin Timms\\' monograph&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Polymath-of-the-Baroque-Agostino-Steffani-and-His-Music/dp/0195154738/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Polymath of the Baroque: Agostino Steffani and His Music</a>&nbsp;- from the section entitled `Music and drama in `Alarico il Baltha\\' \\'. Ms Levi also has connections with Luca Casagrande\\'s website, having recently contributed some material to it. However, Ms Levi does also add some points of her own to her `Alarico\\' review here on Amazon, so I will address some of these. In particular, she singles out a number of the singers for fulsome praise - several of whom, to my ears, sound absolutely dreadful and sing wildly out of tune. In my previous review, I tried to avoid causing too much offense by not naming the worst singers individually, and I will repeat that concession here - except in the case of Luca Casagrande, who directs the ensemble and also sings the important baritone role of Pisone. He sings frequently and painfully out of tune, and must also take overall responsibility for this mostly awful performance and recording.\\n\\nReviewer Ms Levi also makes the point that this was a young cast of singers, around 30 to 35 years of age. Perhaps this is with a view to our making allowances for their youth or inexperience; but are we really expected to make such extreme allowances when we pay out the substantial cost of a three-disc opera set? Besides, I would say that if they can\\'t sing in tune - or at all - by that age then they\\'re unlikely to get much better over the next 35 years.\\n\\nThis recording has a few assets - for example, the able and stylish playing by the instrumentalists of the Scarlatti Camera Ensemble, and the singing of such as mezzo Lee Ji-Young (Honorio) and soprano Won Mi-Jung Capilupi (Placidia); bass Marco Democratico (Lidoro) is not too bad either, at least having a decent voice if not great style. The greatest asset of all, of course, is Steffani\\'s music, and I\\'d greatly love to hear it in a decent recording. But here, I\\'m sorry to say, much of it is ruined by the poor singing and close, harsh, wiry recorded sound. To take just a couple of examples, Stilicone\\'s beautiful chaconne-based aria in Act 1, Scene 15, `Gelosia, lasciami in pace\\' is wrecked by poor singing and dreadful sound quality; and the lovely duet between Semiamira and Stilicone in Act 3 Scene 3, `Care Fiamme/ Amate Catene\\', is ruined by the same factors.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that Steffani\\'s roles intended for male altos are sung here by mezzo and contralto - a practice praised by some reviewers and criticised by others. In fact there appears to be a small but persistent lobby, noticeable among certain reviewers both here and on the Italian Amazon website, who are firmly prejudiced against the countertenor voice and on that basis attempt to discredit the work of great singers such as Philippe Jaroussky and Claudio Cavina.\\n\\nReturning to the main business, however, the principal drawbacks of the present recording are dreadful singing, terrible recorded sound and the absence of any sense of involvement, drama or cohesion. And, if there were any argument at all for scoring it with a second star - which in my view there isn\\'t - I\\'d immediately take one star off again for dodgy practices. If musicians seek public approval for their work, they would do much better to come up with a few decent performances and recordings, rather than produce something like this effort and then try to get their supporters to rig the reviews.

True, \"Children\" was an aberration - great music, good lyrics, perfect order, outstanding mix, lush orchestrations and tons of vision.  Never before had The Mission risen to that level and, sadly, never would they approach it again.  \"Carved In Sand\" has none of the aforementioned elements.  The titles alone betray the lack of ideas.  When your opener is inspired by an ABC TV special, you know there\\'s trouble.  \"Into The Blue\" isn\\'t a half bad song until Reeves Gabrels shows up (and ruins it).  \"Butterfly On A Wheel\" suffers from boredom more so than anything.  I\\'d critique \"Sea Of Love\" except I can\\'t remember a note from it.  \"Deliverance\" almost delivers until Simon Hinkler unveils perhaps the most annoying guitar tone of its time.

All in all, this is a terribly written, dreadfully performed, incompetently recorded (by Tim Palmer, of all people) and downright insulting piece of half-baked nonsense.  The band itself was so disillusioned that they released all their outtakes in the hopes that they actually had an idea somewhere (1991\\'s \"Grains Of Sand\").

However, it is a rare moment when my ears are pleased and my heart is touched. On one such occasion I was relaxing at home watching \"Reflections\". Daystar produces this television program which showcases nature-loving videos with scripture notes accompanied with mostly instrumental melodies.\\n\\nOn this one specific night I had my eyes closed and suddenly this voice began to awaken and touch my soul. Then the message began to sink in and I had to rewind it to find out who it was. When they first started singing he reminded me slightly of Chris August but as the song continued it was more like the style of Jason Upton. It was melodically and lyrically beautiful. To my delight the person\\'s name was a mystery causing me to speak to myself like I was Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nKristian Binion was the answer to the riddle at that moment and God is the master of his talent. A graduate from Christ for the Nations International he learned early on what the significance of a close relationship with Jesus Christ brings to writing. With gifted musicians like Kari Jobe and others you have to wonder, what does this University instill in their students that other colleges do not?\\n\\nI received his current EP, which sadly only includes three songs. The first single on the album is the notable song I heard that evening and title of the EP, \"Pieces\". It speaks about how fragile we are and how often times we don\\'t feel worthy of repair. However, God sees us as a moldable project as He restores us and makes us new.\\n\\nThis song really touched my heart as I sit discovering this artist as he moved my spirit. It is so personal and speaks to those who have a broken and contrite heart. At some point we all experience moments of heartbreak and desperation. It could be the loss of a loved one or a feeling of rejection. It could also be backslider who was once close to God who has fallen and is trying to find their way back. All of these scenarios fit the message, along with many others I have not mentioned. The closing segment is one of the most powerful lyrics I have heard recently. \"When this world pushes my heart to break. But every piece of it sings your praise. If it takes falling to see your face, then somebody push me for Heavens sake.\"\\n\\nKristian\\'s heart is all about making God famous and hoping his worship will touch someone that needs to know that God is the answer to every problem they will ever face. We all have broken pieces or areas the world has vexed us in and if we turn everything over to Him, He can make something out of us to use for His glory. I have found myself asking God to keep me broken so that I never want to leave His side. Being near to God at all times is vital to our spiritual health and growth.\\n\\nI cannot express to you how gifted this young man is. You just have to be inclined to discover him for yourself. I do believe that he has a huge future ahead of him musically and spiritually leading people in worship and to a closer walk with Christ through his ministry.\\n\\nThe second song on the release is titled \"Narrow Way\". This is a message that is urgent for the Body of Christ today and the title is exactly what it is about. Many people today are on the broad path that leads to destruction. They have been tossed about with every wind of doctrine and spoon fed grace to a point they feel a personal relationship and repentance is not required of them. Kristian lays his heart on the floor before the Lord in this beautiful adoration of a man desiring to exemplify Christ. \"I wanna say what you would say. I wanna love the same way. Until everything I do is a reflection of you. I will follow the path you\\'ve made along the narrow way. There\\'s a ladder you can climb to pull yourself up to the sky. But you will be sure to find you will fall if you get to high. But that ladder it leads back down where the humble and broken are found.\"\\n\\nAfter listening to the third song \"Strong Tower\", I was extremely unsettled about the fact that there were no more for me to listen to. This song brought out a different sound from Kristian and I had a hard time deciding which I liked better. It was at that point that I decided God\\'s perfect number is three and this EP is one hundred and ten percent fascinating. That being said I am looking forward to seeing what God has in store for this extraordinarily gifted young man.\\n\\nEager to see how long I was going to have to wait to hear more from Kristian, I asked him when he was going to bless us all with a full length album.\\n\\nKristian - \"I\\'m currently writing new songs to go along with a lot more that didn\\'t make the EP. I am praying and believing God for a full-length record someday. I know it will happen in His timing. Meanwhile, I plan to start recording some acoustic videos of new songs that God has given me. Those should be coming very soon!\"\\n\\nAs someone who is passionate about writing for God I asked what advice Kristian would share with others who have a dream to sing and minister and to share God with others in song.\\n\\nKristian - \"I would say don\\'t ever let anything stop you! Not even yourself! I struggled for a long time with not feeling adequate or good enough. It wasn\\'t until I surrendered to God and stopped worrying about what people thought. I started reading the word and seeking Him and God started dropping songs in my heart. I would tell God how you feel, ask Him to write through you. It may not come right away but God is faithful and He will begin to birth songs in your heart that will draw people to Him.\"\\n\\nToday you see a lot of youth struggling with choices either to fit in at school or with their friends outside of school. They are willing often times to sacrifice the gifts God has placed in them to use for His Kingdom for momentary popularity. As a young man himself growing up with the temptations and trials of youth I was curious what or who influenced him to lay everything at the cross and truly walk with Christ.\\n\\nKristian -\" I would have to say my Grandfather, V.R. Mitchell. I was going through a time in my life where I was not really living completely for God. I mean, I loved God and I knew how to act and knew what to say to make it seem like we were close. But in reality I was riding the fence. While I was visiting with my Grandfather one day it was like he knew exactly what was going on. But he didn\\'t give me a speech or tell me I was a sinner. He just very calmly grabbed my hand looked me straight in the eyes as I was leaving and said \"Son, Grab a hold of Jesus and don\\'t ever let him Go! That\\'s all he said but it was all I needed! Instantly I knew it was God speaking through him. And I will never forget that moment the rest of my life! That is what I would say to a young person who is struggling to fit in. DON\\'T FIT IN! Grab a hold Of Jesus and don\\'t ever let Go! It\\'s not always easy and we are human. We will mess up. But don\\'t ever forget to cling to Jesus it\\'s the only way to make it.\"\\n\\nKristian is right we are human and we all mess up, but one thing is for certain he did everything right on this EP. Check it out for yourself and take advantage of being the first person to share his music with someone else. Trust me when I say don\\'t let someone else steal your blessing from doing so. I hope and pray that this review may open doors for Kristian to explore that full-length album because I personally don\\'t know how long I can wait to hear it.\\n\\nI would like to give special recognition for musicians, mixers and producers who made \"Pieces\" what it is.

In all fairness, the shockers in his discography (as known to me) are legion. His Haydn for instance is banal in the extreme; his Mozart is the musical equivalent of turbo-lax; his Beethoven is comic rather than cosmic; his Brahms induces nausea and felonious indeed is his Bruckner: other than that, he offers a welcome relief from vibrato, orchestral excellence and metaphysics for those so inclined. Much to his anguish, Roger the Hapless has been trumped in my estimation by Mehta whose bone-lazy Wagner lays claim to being Ground Zero (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Ring-Hlts/dp/B0000026OJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Ring-Hlts</a>). The matter is still in doubt: black holes await investigation, one of them being Sir Roger\\'s survey of Schumann\\'s Symphonies with his long-suffering galley-slaves: the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (whenever I hear these poor devils. I rethink my position on euthanasia).\\n\\nHere are ten reasons why this cycle warrants consideration in my quest.\\n\\n1. 90% of the time, Sir Roger is metrical beyond a metronome. I sense that as a child, he underwent a formative experience with a brass-band from the local colliery: there is no other way to explain his \"oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa\" approach to rhythm.\\n\\n2. Schumann\\'s fever-pitch mania which is so integral to his psyche is muted in each performance.\\n\\n3. Unrelentingly, phrases are clipped one after another. Roger the Hapless also spurns vibrato with his usual degree of dogmatism. In consequence, every bar is a test of one\\'s stamina.\\n\\n4. Geez, the strings of the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra are vin ordinaire with a vengeance. Listen to them in the slow movement of the Spring Symphony: it\\'s moggy central - meow!\\n\\n5. The Scherzo of the Second is the very definition of note-spinning. I yelled aloud \"FFS Roger - do something with the music!!! Do something! Anything!\" Alas, the great man was too busy worrying about vibrato to respond. Thankfully we all know there is more to this music than this banal account. The slow movement is equally vapid and shallow; not even a tadpole could survive in it.\\n\\n6. There\\'s no apotheosis at the end of the Second: it\\'s just another fortissimo to Roger the Hapless.\\n\\n7. Where is the barely suppressed excitement in the first movement of the Rhenish? How is such an omission possible?\\n\\n8. Mysticism, it is safe to say, is not Roger\\'s strong suit . . . As performed here, the fourth movement of the Rhenish has little to do with the consecration of a cardinal; it\\'s more an evocation of chop suey.\\n\\n9. Yes Veronica, it is possible to play the first movement of the Fourth as if it\\'s in a major key: that\\'s how little \\'fear and loathing\\' Roger is able to generate.\\n\\n10. The stupendous transition into the finale of the Fourth - Schumann at white heat - is mundane. It\\'s an embarrassment to compare it with the likes of Furtwangler, Karajan, Szell and Kubelik.\\n\\nUndistinguished as it is, this cycle offers no real challenge to Uncle Zubin\\'s stupendous achievement: it\\'s more boring and befuddled than sordid. Further afield, Roger\\'s Brahms cycle on Hanssler is actually more horrific than this sorry affair - but who has the wherewithal to revisit such horror when life is so short? Not me!

Always graceful and elegant, this is some of Lachini\\'s most beautiful and evocative music to date. A very prolific composer who has done a great deal of film soundtrack work as well as his own arrangements of Iranian folk and pop music, Lachini has a distinctive style that often reflects his own cultural influences as well as his European musical training - a true world musician! Fellow pianists will delight in the companion songbook, which is also reviewed here.\\n\\n\"Requiem 3\" begins with \"Farewell to Past,\" a somber piece that is sad but not without hope. The extensive use of trills enhances the emotional quality of the piece and gives it a more classical approach. \"Secrets and Dreams\" is strongly influenced by some of Chopin\\'s nocturnes and is a favorite. The emotional nature of the piece touches the heart and evokes a deep sigh. \"Morning Light\" is delicate, hopeful, and very moving. \"Silent Truth\" again hints of Chopin\\'s introspective melancholy with a slowly flowing left hand and poignant melody - another favorite. \"Shadows\\' Fate\" has a somewhat more tragic quality with an elegant melody and gentle left hand accompaniment. \"Embrace\" is slow, graceful, and very passionate. \"Dilemma\" beautifully conveys the emotional confusion of having to make a difficult choice.

However, the remaining 3, plus the 7 on Ninth, that makes for a full, excellent, 5 out of 5 listening experience.\\n\\nMost artists record more songs for an album than will actually make the final cut.

I can't say that does him any favours, because a lot of people will listen to an album and think 'wtf?' But we can be thankful we have everything now, and make our own 'perfect album' as we see fit.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe with Peter's recent solo work is some bad artistic decisions on the vocals. Until recently, his performances were always flawless. Different... but flawless. He has developed the annoying habit of singing entire songs two or three times, then pasting all the vocal tracks on top of each other, slightly out of time, and very out of tune, with some wild warbles thrown in. Backing vocals should be used sparingly, to emphasize important words or add atmosphere, but if its the entire track, it gets confusing on the ear, and sounds over-produced. 'Secret' and 'Secret Silk Society' suffer extraordinarily badly from this.\\n\\nWhen he sings properly though, he has an excellent voice. And its a voice I like to hear. I can't hear how he sings if its diluted by multiple versions of the same thing. However, the song 'Good Works' suffers none of these problems. The voice is clear, solid, passionate, and haunting. The track is so good that I rated the album 4 instead of 3 on this experience alone. It might become my favourite Peter track of all time.\\n\\n'Secret' isn't vocally pleasing, but its passable, and the song itself is a tremendous feat of writing. Despite the fact it could have been better, I rate it 4.\\n\\nThen theres the delicious 'Rose Hunter' track. It shines as a perfect companion to the perfect 'I Spit Roses' of Ninth. It has a similar structure, with vocal humming layered underneath a chorus which cuts suddenly with the word 'lovers!' (as opposed to 'spit!) Perfect. Its sung with great passion, and builds throughout.\\n\\nAll in all, 4 out of 5, because it completes 'Ninth' perfectly, and now I feel complete.

The sound is excellent, as is the orchestral work (listen, for example, to the growling lower strings at the end of the first movement of K. 491). There are also some rather interesting cadenzas here, paricularly Faure\\'s fascinating (if anachronistic) cadenza in K. 491. The booklet notes are fine. The author points to the dramatic operatic qualities of the works, paricularly the aria-like quality of the slow movements. And these are the qualities missing from these neat, prettified performances. A friend of mine once aptly observed that Mozart pianissimos should never sound like Chopin\\'s, which is precisely what Primakov\\'s soft-focused playing suggests. To my ears the softness of his touch combined with a reluctance to play anything above a piano produces deadly results. I started with K. 491, and the first movement went reasonably well.  The trouble began with the slow movement, played at a somewhat slow tempo (no problem) and at exactly the same muted dynamic level throughout. It sounded like cocktail music to me. The finale was also slow and also lacking in drama. The beautiful dialogue for piano and oboe made almost no impression because it sounded just like everythinjg else in the movement. For comparison, I turned to Richard Good\\'s excellent performance with Orpheus. What a contrast Goode\\'s clear, focused sound was to Primakov\\'s dreamy tinkling. Still, this performance was superior to that of K. 503.  Once again, the opening movenment was satisfactory.  But the last two movements were awful. The slow movement is \"dreamy,\" the trills barely audible, and any operatic quality entirely lost. The finale was dreadfully dull, with Primakov playing one passage after another without the slightest sparkle or drama. I was disheartened, but I went on and found the last two concertos equally sweet, pretty, and boring. Judging from the excellent reviews this release has received it seems that many people like their Mozart played this way. For such listeners, the present release can be safely recommended, for Primakov\\'s playing is unfailingly \"beautiful.\" But if you like your Mozart played with passion and drama, you should go elsewhere.', 0, 0), ('Only one song, but it sure is my favorite.

Certainly his music is more intended as impression rather than developmental progression. This is supported by there being no format: no sonata, no quartet, no concerto, no symphony, etc. Simply pieces that do not connect with any other movements.\\n\\nThere are bases of logic to the works, however clouded and non-relatable to the layman as they are. Traum des Sangers is based upon a sketch by Caspar David Friedrich depicting a sleeping muse and angels above him. The notes say that the work represents this as two sound worlds, one of the real dreamer, the other of the surreal/unreal celestial element, oddly with the latter musical unit being more clearly structured (more real) than the former. The notes ask \"Who is dreaming who?\". The piece entitled WAM, which are the initials of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, reportedly works fragments of several of Mozart\\'s works which are distorted, though they are so distorted that I can hear none of it. The liner notes refer to several quotes of Mozart: \"In order to be a success one would write stuff that is so inane a carthorse could sing it, or so unintelligible no sensible person could be bothered to work it out\", etc. These quotes represent existential struggles that Finnissy grappled with, whether Mozart was always great, the end-all-be-all one who intimidates composers who follow.  This all suggests that Finnissy was grappling with the accessibility of his own music. But all this results in a piece that is lethargic and aimless music. Mars + Venus considers a Reubens painting of the same name, featuring a man and woman. Finnissy apparently then considers the Mars and the Venus (apparently because of the male-female dichotomy) within us, which are not separable but interact and add. So the piece warps feelings of war and love, again as some non-forward moving, non-developing cloud.\\n\\nThere are numerous discs available with Finnissy\\'s music. So somebody in the academic music community likes him. But you have to ask the age-old question of music: who is it for? Intellectual insiders, or the greater world? Or does an artist create out of what he/she needs to say, without regard to anything else? Certainly the latter is a given. But then don\\'t expect the public to come along.

But they also add a strong stamp of character, making the music vividly alive.

Beethoven's Adagio cantabile from Pathtique Sonata:  this is described as a grand expansive movement.  While the performance has its moments, it lacks grandness or expansiveness.  The approach is mostly lacking in heart.  Puccini's Doretta's Dream from La Rondine:  fails to conveys the notion of true love & passion.  Tchaikovsky's None but the Lonely Heart:  lacks the depth of melancholy this song is known for.  Grieg's The Last Spring from Two Elegaic:  lacks the heartbreak on seeing the season of rebirth colored by the possibility that the viewer may not live to see another.  Massennet's Elegie:  strikes the right note here.  Mascagni's Intermezzo from Cavelleria rusticana:  beautiful serene piece played too heavy handed.  Chopin's Prelude No. 15 in D-Flat Major:  low notes lack clarity.  Piano almost sounds like an organ.  Brahm's Waltz in A-flat Major, Op. 39, No. 15:  OK, has some dance-like rhythm to it.  Rachmoninoff's Variation No. 18 from Rhapsody on a Theme from Paginini:  best cut on CD.  Bizet's Habaera from Carmen:  OK.  Has some rhythm and variety of touch.

In 1960 he cut his first solo single, the instrumental All Nite Long Parts 1 and II for Joe Ruffino\\'s Ron Records (Ron 327), which also did very well on a regional basis.\\n\\nBut his own hits were sparse, with the best being his vocal Barefootin\\' which surged to # 2 R&B and # 7 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in May/June 1966 for Nola Records, owned by Wardell Quezergue (March 12, 1930 - September 6, 2011) who, known as \"the Creole Beethoven\" in his native Louisiana, also produced his sides for that label. Released as Nola 721, the flip was Let\\'s Go Baby (Where The Action Is), a tune in keeping with the ongoing Go-Go Dancing craze of the day. After the follow-up Happy Feet/The Scratch went nowhere that same year on Nola 726, he managed to edge onto both charts again in January 1967 with the # 48 R&B/# 83 Hot 100 Tip Toe on Nola 729 b/w Soul Kind Of Loving. In the meantime, he had had his one vinyl LP released titled, naturally, \"Barefootin\\'\" (Nola LP-1001) containing:  A1. Barefootin\\'; A2. Let\\'s Go, Baby (Where The Action Is); A3. Mr. Pitful; A4. I\\'ve Been Loving You Too Long; A5. Soul Kind Of Living; A6. C. C. Rider; B1. The Scratch; B2. Happy Feet; B3. In The Midnight Hour; B4. Directly From My Heart; B5. Heading For A Fall; B6. I Can\\'t Help Myself.\\n\\nAfter that it would be tough sledding as none among the following could get him back on the charts: Secret Service (Makes Me Nervous)/Yak Yak Yak (Nola 733) and Holdin\\' Out/Caught You In A Lie (Nola 738), both in 1967, followed by You Shaken\\' Things Up/You See Me (Silver Fox 12) in 1969, Get Ta Steppin\\'/Get Right On Down (Island 015) in 1974 and Give Me The Country Side Of Life/same song (Island 044) in 1975. In that span, of course, he continued with his busy session work. There may well have been other singles of which I am unaware. You should note that Barefootin\\' had also come out in 1966 on Head 1050 b/w Shootin\\' The Grease by Jesse Gresham Plus 3, but the Nola release is recognized as the hit version.\\n\\nThe tracks in this volume are: 1.

They have issued a mix of old, re-hashed material from other collections in their \"99\" series and new classical music that is pretty interesting -- at least interesting enough to draw me in at the bargain price as the MP3 Daily Deal on October 14, 2011.\\n\\nThis is almost all excellent music in good to very good performances. If you haven\\'t bought a lot of these collections previously, it is a no-brainer at the special price.\\n\\nSome number crunching. Based on my own collection -- these numbers may be much smaller or a little larger for you depending on what you\\'ve purchased from these sets in the past -- 52 of the 99 tracks here have been released on previous \"99\" sets by X5. A further four tracks are music that has been featured before, but are here in different performances. The remaining 43 tracks are music new to the series.\\n\\nAmong the music that has been featured before are a lot of classical music \"greatest hits\" -- some of the most famous Beethoven piano sonatas, Schubert\\'s Rosamunde string quartet, Brahms\\' 3rd Symphony, and a good smattering of Mozart, for example.\\n\\nWithin the set of new music, a few things stood out and tipped me over the edge on the decision to buy. Most important was the inclusion of Charles Ives\\' Violin Sonata No. 2, played by Sweden\\'s Karl-Ove Mannberg and Lena Johnson. X5 is pretty savvy when it comes to capitalizing on what\\'s going on in the classical world, so I imagine they included this because violin superstar Hilary Hahn has just released&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/her-own-excellent-album-of-the-Ives-sonatas/dp/B005DWX9YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">her own excellent album of the Ives sonatas</a>. I was glad to hear the Mannberg/Johnson performance, but I can\\'t say it\\'s my favorite.\\n\\nAnother highlight among the new stuff is the Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes by Benjamin Britten, performed under conductor Neeme Jarvi.

For brevity (instead of naming all the sound-a-likes), Ill just say envision King Crimson with Kate Bush as the lead vocalist.  The CD is not very long at only around 38 minutes, and it basically is just one little snippet of noise after another for the most part - lot of intense angular type noise, with little melodic breaks.  There are no extended melodies.  It sounds as though basically the group went into the studio with the sole purpose of just trying to throw in every kind of abstract, mishmash, gadgetry, off-the-wall soundscape that they could think of (you know the kitchen sink concept).  But to close on a positive note, the reason I said the CD shows promise is because the lead vocalist does have a nice voice and the playing does sound like a nice overall tight ensemble, i.e., good musicianship.

This reissue carries catalog number 4041.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nAs with Minor Move and Back to the Tracks, Tina Brooks\\' True Blue is an album of hard bop excellence. Recorded in \\'60, it finds the tenor saxophonist accompanied by Freddie Hubbard on trumpet (a week after Brooks helped Hubbard on his debut album, Open Sesame), Duke Jordan on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. The six original compositions by Brooks are well-crafted, though none are stellar. The group\\'s cohesive sound, its consistent blues-induced jazz groove, and the numerous well-defined solos are the album\\'s strengths.\\n\\nYou\\'d never know it from listening to his distinctive tone and melodic attitude, but Brooks never made it big. Though he recorded four albums for Blue Note, True Blue was the only one that was released during his lifetime. I\\'ll health and drugs eventually took their toll and he passed away in \\'74 at 42 years of age.\\n\\nThere is a terrifically pensive blues cry in every Brooks solo on this release that is mesmerizing. While he\\'s often shadowed by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, the two gracefully bring out some profoundly thoughtful improvising from each other. None of the five tunes (and two alternative takes) are exactly inspiring tunes. But Brooks packs a lot of raw emotionality and innovative musical craft into his solos. Although the liner notes makes much of the Sonny Rollins influence, I actually hear a lot more of a tone I\\'d connect to Booker Erwin, Ornette Coleman, or Brooks\\' companion in the Blue Note recording studio, Jackie McLean. Anyone who enjoyed the dramatic support Brooks gave McLean on Jackie\\'s Bag should treasure this, the only album Brooks released under his name as leader during his lifetime. Brooks sounds like a desperately driven musician wanting something beyond the bop of 1960 and never quite making the breakthrough to freedom that McLean found through his association with Ornette Coleman. The rhythm section of drummer Art Taylor, bassist Sam Jones, and pianist Duke Jordan simply never push him that hard to explore new musical territory. I wonder who Brooks would have become had he worked with a drummer like Eddie Blackwell or Elvin Jones.\\n\\nWhat True Blue gives generously is a full blooded musical portrait of a hard-working and distinctive sounding tenor man with a blue cry stuck in his throat and heart. It is an achievement to treasure.\\n\\nEnd Review:\\n\\nI could not agree more with the above two reviews. If you do not have Tina Brooks in your jazz library, you have missed on of the all time greats. While Tina Brooks does not have a large body of work and he ceased recording in 1961, \"True Blue\" remains on of those tour de force recordings to be treasured forever.\\n\\nView the pics and decide for yourself.
