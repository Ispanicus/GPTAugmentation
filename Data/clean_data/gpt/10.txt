0	sigh . conor , what happened ? for the past decade you have given u the most amazing lyric , the most stripped down ( or fancifully gussied up ) tune and then you go and drop this mess on u ? your album prior to this have all been brilliant in their own unique way but the people key doe nothing to advance the dialogue . stilted lyric , out of place electro effect and a rambling , incoherent vein throughout make this one to pas on and pretend it never happened . a little more restraint in the studio would be greatly appreciated next time around , gentleman . signed , someone who gave all your other album 5 star and would have given lifted 6 star if that were possible . your well earned 1 star ranking reflects both the quality of the music a well a the overwhelming let-down factor .
1	man zapp wa funky from the start discovered by bootsy collins and promoted by george clinton these boy could not help but be funky and set the world on fire cause more bounce had everybody bugging out in the 80 and one of the most sampled song in history next to atomic dog . brand new p player and be alright is some monster funk a well funky bounce feratures bootsy baby . a funkateer aint funkin with the right stuff if he doe not have this in his collection .
