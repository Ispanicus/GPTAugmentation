1	i have listened to smooth jazz many time and have never heard such a wonderful cd . my favorite song are i wish i could see the world and it is all over now .
0	i wa very disappointed to find that i could not buy this album . i had purchased it on cd , and i had been listening to it on my computer without any trouble . i looked online and found that this is probably the reason why this song would not play on the cd player . it wa not a problem with the player , it wa problem with the cd . so i emailed them and asked them why this song would not play on my computer and would not play on the player and they replied that it may be because i had an incorrect version of the song and they would help me remedy the problem . i did not want to pay for a new download , so instead i emailed them and asked them why the song would not play on my player and would not play on the computer and they replied that it wa because the song wa crammed . i asked them to tell me what that mean , and they replied that the song wa not intended to be played . but the song play on my computer in the car .
0	this album is good in a sense that it is better than some other major hip-hop album . in all honesty , i do not think that it is a better album than most other major hip-hop album . they do not sound like they should . the only reason they are worth a purchase is because of a few song . i think that the album overall is a waste of $ 3.99 . the only reason i am not giving this a zero is because it is not a bad album . the worst album of the year . i give it 2. i am not a fan of this group . i think that they sound generic . the only thing that really stand out is hoe down on my homies . i feel like that song is a little bit off the wall . there may be a few hit here and there but there is not a lot of them . if you like to listen to music and are looking for a hip-hop album , then do not bother . this album is not worth your time .
1	this is a great song with great lyric . i like the song , but i would like to see it a a separate cd .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to see what i could get out of it and it turned out to be a fine purchase . the song are all good , but there are some that need to be rewritten . i would recommend this cd for those who like to hear the classic without the fluff , and for a song that need to be rewritten .

1	meghan trainor ha a beautiful voice . i would have to say that i wa not blown away by this cd . i would have to say that i wa not blown away by any of her cd . i think that she ha a great voice but i do not think that this cd ha been the best for her .

0	this is a good album by a band i never heard of .
0	the original recording wa made in 1946. but , the original song wa recorded by the big band in the 1940s . the lyric were written by jack scott , who wrote the tune for the original version of this song . so , the original version is by jack scott and bob johnson . the original version is a little different to the version that is on this cd . i guess it is different because i have never heard that version before .

1	i love thalia . this is my second time listening to her .
0	i would like to recommend your music to anyone .
0	i do not know who i am anymore .
0	i have been listening to this recently and find it to be a mixed bag . the music is all over the map , and the vocal seem to come and go , so i would recommend either buying this album to get the best feel you can out of it , or you can just listen to the cd to enjoy the music . i also do not hear much from the horn . i also do not see any harm in buying this cd , the only time i do not buy album is when i get a bad one . i like the music on the dandy warhol and the cramp , but i do not like this cd . however , a i have said , i do not own a cd player ( or i have one , but have not listened to it since i got it ) , so i can not tell you what i think about the music . i do not personally care for the style of music . i am not a fan of the vocal . i am not a fan of the song . i just do not care for the music . i am a fan of the music , but i am not a fan of the music .

1	this is one of the best album i have ever downloaded . the sound alone is worth the price . the music is good and the lyric are beautiful .
0	meghan trainor is a talented young woman with a great voice who is really good at writing song . i like the opening song chasing the dragon ( which ha a great song structure , ) and the rest of the song were pretty good . i think her voice is a great asset to her song . i think the song are pretty catchy . overall , i would recommend this cd . it is not the cd for me . i think i need to listen to it more often just to listen to the lyric and see how i can learn from them .
1	i purchased this cd for the very reason that i am in a state of total boredom . i like the song on this cd and would recommend it to those who enjoy western music . but i have to say that i do not like the cd enough to buy it .

0	i wa first introduced to these guy by a former student who had heard them in a club in boston . a friend from high school and i started to see them play periodically and at the time i thought they were pretty good . i wa in my mid 20 when my friend introduced me to the band . i loved the music , but i had the feeling that i wa missing something . this wa the beginning . at the time , i thought they were going to be the next big rock band that would rock the world . i wa wrong . i wa wrong , but i wa wrong . it is been a long time since i last saw them . the band ha not changed much , they still play the same music , but they have moved on to different material . i miss them . i miss them a lot . i miss them a lot . i miss them a lot . i miss them a lot .
0	for me this wa a mixed bag . some of the song were very good but many were just okay . this is not a great collection .
1	this song is catchy , and i like the lyric .
0	after hearing a couple of the track on the cd , i thought that i had heard something that sounded good , something that i liked . unfortunately , the rest of the album wa very disappointing . the other track on the cd are bland and uninteresting . i can not say that this album is really different from the other album i have listened to by libera . the sound quality wa great , the song were different but the same . this is not a great album . it is very average .

1	great song . i have already downloaded the song several time . it is very good .
0	this is the album that the mainstream ha been waiting for . it is the most complete album out of all of them . it is the type of album that will continue to grow and make their way to the top of the chart and stay there . there are two separate , separate , separate album here . the first album is just a collection of song that have been recorded on the same day and mixed in the studio . the second album is a completely different , completely different , completely different album . the song on this album are more mature , more mature , more mature , more mature . there is a maturity that is missing on the other , more immature , more immature album . the second album is more mature . the song on the first album are more immature . the song on the second album are more mature . there are no more song that are immature on this album . there are two separate , separate , separate album here . one album ha song that are mature , song that are mature , song that are mature . the other album ha song that are more mature , song that are more mature , song that are more mature . the first album is just a collection of song that have been performed live by a group of people . the second album is a completely different , completely different , completely separate album . the song on the first album are performed by one person . the song on the second album are performed by two separate people . the song on the first album are recorded at the same time , mixed together and recorded on a different day . the song on the second album are recorded on different day , mixed together and recorded on different day . the song on the first album are a collection of song that were recorded at the same time . the song on the second album are a collection of song that were recorded on different day . the song on the first album have the same amount of instrumentation , the same amount of instrumentation , the same amount of instrumentation . the song on the second album have different instrument , different instrument , different instrument . the first album is more mature , the second album is more mature . there are no more song that are immature on this second album . there are two separate , separate , separate album here .

0	this cd is fun to listen to , but i do not think that it is something for all age . i listened to it with my wife and my 11-year-old son to get them excited about christmas , but they did not care for it . my 8-year-old son think that the music is old-fashioned , and i have to agree . but i feel that it is worth a try .

1	this song wa absolutely stunning .
0	i have a cd of smooth jazz from the mid-70s . i have no idea who the musician were but i am sure they were great . smooth jazz is pretty much the pinnacle of music . i love this album . it is probably the most underrated album of all time . i do not know if that make me a bad person or what , but i do not know who the people in the smooth jazz band were either . it is an important album for me because it wa the first album with me and my friend . it wa the first time we recorded together . there is nothing like it .
1	i just heard this song and immediately liked it . i like the fact that this song is different than the majority of trainors song . she ha a very clean and simple sound and it make me want to listen to her more .
1	i like my version better . it is much better .
1	i bought this cd to give to my daughter . she had a great time with it .
1	this album is amazing ! i have listened to it at work , at home and on the train . i love it !
1	if you love celtic music , this cd is for you . the cd wall is a hit . i have to say that i think that the musicianship of the cd is very good . the cd is worth the money .
1	this band is so fresh and original . they are different from all the other band that i have heard . i wish they had more album . i wish they would release a dvd with all their music and video . i hope they keep doing what they are doing .

0	i do not really like this song but my friend like it .
1	i really enjoyed this cd .
0	i wa a little disappointed that the album is only one cd . the cd is also the same price a the one-disc version , but at least you get to go back to listen to the song you have already listened to . the cd is only one disc , and is a little smaller than the original . i would think that this is a good idea a a college student .
1	i love this guy ! i love this album ! this album is amazing . i love this guy !
1	we need to get this song to all our friend that never get to see opera . this is just too good !
1	i have just started playing this cd on the computer and i thought it sounded good . it ha good song with good lyric . i have heard of other cd that you can download and i have heard that you have to buy the cd to download it . i thought buying this cd would make it easy to download and i would be able to play it right away . it doe not seem to work that way for me . i really like the song on this cd and would recommend it to anyone .
1	this is a great cd . the chorus and harmony are wonderful . i love the music and it make me want to buy more cd by this artist .
0	i wa in a coma for all of the summer , but i am not in one now . i am not even going to begin to try and understand this .
0	i wanted to like this album , but i just could not . it is not that bad , but it is just the same generic . i do not like the fact that they make thalia a singer , but i do like the idea . the fact that he sings is good enough . i do not know why he is trying to make up for ai 2006/7 , but it is just too generic . i hate ai , but i wish he would release a new album with new song . it would be better than this boring old ai .
0	the song on this are ok , but they are all the same . i wa really hoping for something new and different but all of these song repeat in that same manner . i would rather listen to a song from a different artist than i would to listen to this . i think i will listen to the last 5 song again and make up my mind on whether i like the whole album or not .
0	wow . this is a great song . i wa looking for something different and i love meghan trainors voice . i think this song is great . i have listened to it several time .
0	i have not listened to this album for some month and never will again .
0	i listened to this song a few time to make sure that it wa not one of those track that i liked but could not find another song to compare it to . i listened to several of these track that i liked and found a better one , so i continued to listen to them . this wa not one of the better one . i am not a fan at all . this is not a bad song . i just do not think i will buy it . i listened to it a few time to make sure that it wa not one of those track i liked but could not find another song to compare it to . it is not that great , and i think it will be gone in a few day . i do not know why i am even listening to this at all . i am not a fan at all . i have listened to this artist music before , and i do not like it . i can not believe i listened to it . i will not buy it .
0	this is a little pricey , but if you do not mind spending a little extra for quality you will definitely be happy with it .
0	the first cd of this album is a collection of schubert lied - very enjoyable . the second cd is his chamber work - which is more enjoyable . the cd of the lied is all of the song on the album . i would like to hear more of the lied . i wa disappointed that schubert music wa not recorded in the same setting that he would be performing . i would have preferred to hear the song recorded in a concert hall . i would have preferred to hear more of the lied . i have not yet heard the third cd , but i will review it when i do .
1	this song wa a good choice for meditation . it is a nice song .
1	it wa a very good purchase . i think it should be more popular .
1	this is a brilliant collection of music for those who want to know more about opera . i am sure that it can also be of great interest to those who are not opera lover .
0	well , this is a good song . it is got a great chorus and some good hook to it . the beat is good and it ha a good flow . the song ha some good hook to it and it ha a good beat to it .
1	this cd is a definite must have for my library ! i have been a fan of danzig since the beginning . i have admired his talent since he first started singing his music . i have been listening to him for over 20 year . i am always amazed at the way he approach his music . i am not a big fan of any one artist , i like different artist . the one thing i like in his music is the way he deal with the subject matter . i have been able to connect with him by listening to his music . i just love the way he sings . it is very calming to listen to his music .
0	i think i heard this song on the radio . this is the first time i have heard this song . i like it . i do not really think you can blame this one on twiztid . i do not think it is his fault , i think it is just a bad song . i have heard this song a lot of time on the radio , but i have never really paid attention to it . i thought i heard this song on the album , but i do not think i really did . i do not know why i can not listen to it . i bought the album for the song , and i will buy the vinyl for the song . this is an okay song , but it doe not really do anything for me . i like it , but it doe not really do anything for me .
1	i wa hoping this album would be good , especially since i have been listening to meghan trainor lately . i wa disappointed with the album , however , because the song are quite boring . the only good thing is the track i love the song , but that is it . i did like the song i love you though . i would like to see meghan trainor release another album . the song are good , the singer are good , and the overall production is good .
0	i did not think the song wa bad . i liked it . i liked the music and the lyric .
0	a lot of these song sound like they are on the radio . the band is a very good band but the material they have put out for sale is a lot of filler . i would like to know if the band is planning on releasing any more material . i do not think they need to .

0	i love the song that are on this cd . the lyric are great . the music is wonderful . the music brings me joy .
0	this is a cd full of song and not the actual singing . i have read before that it may be used for singing , but this is for playing the guitar . if you are looking for a song to sing , this one will not be suitable . if you want more than one song to play at the same time , this is great .
1	i love it !
0	i have a great collection of classical music , but i have not known to download it . i have been looking for several classical album , but none have been on amazon , so i had to resort to the link on the cd . this album is a little on the expensive side but still worth the money .
0	i thought the lyric were cool and the instrumentation wa great . the only problem is that the song just is not very good .
0	i can not believe i wasted my money on this album . i have heard these guy 3 time now and they all sounded like shit .
0	i received a cd , but i did not listen to it , and i had to return it because the song i wanted were not on it ( otherwise , i would have bought it ) . i am so frustrated i am going to make an amazon review . it is one of the reason i use the amazon feedback system . i have had a problem with music on the cd i have ordered , and have written to amazon regarding that problem . i would like to see what amazon would do to correct the problem on this cd . i will update this review once i get an answer . it is a good cd , but it is not what i wanted . also , i will update this review after i receive a response from amazon .
1	a very cool song .
1	i love this album .
0	this is by far the worst music i have ever heard in my life . i mean , this is just boring . this music is not even good . the song are terrible , the voice are terrible , and the melody are atrocious . i would rather listen to a cd that i can imagine my wife singing along to instead of this . this music is not even good . i have listened to it twice , and i do not even do love song . i do not know why i am reviewing this . i am just giving a review , i do not even care about the cd . i am just trying to make a point , i do not even care about it .

1	this is a very sad song . i love it ! i will get it all the time . i am so happy i purchased it . i would not listen to the other song on the album if i had not purchased this one .
0	not so much the song , but the whole collection is nice . you might have to download it a couple of time to get all the song .
0	the new song lose yourself is like a remix of the old song lose yourself by eminem . i understand his new music is getting better , but why doe he change his song so much ? i thought lose yourself wa his best song . i did not like the new lose yourself . i wa hoping that lose yourself would be better than the old song . i will listen to both song and choose the new song .
1	i wa looking for a single where i could hear the guitar a little better . i just wasnt satisfied with many of the song . this song is one of the best in the album .
0	i like the first cd , though . i have not purchased the second cd yet . i got it from cdshopper to try it out . it is way overpriced and i wa hoping for somethin

0	i have been a fan of christian music since the early 70 . i wa introduced to worship and praise music in the early 80 . i have been very fortunate to have had the opportunity to attend various christian concert and event . even though i have not been able to attend every concert and event , i have made it a point to see and hear a many a possible . i have to say that i am very disappointed with this cd . i have listened to most of the song that were available on the cd several time over the last few week . i heard the song that were on the cd several time and i wa disappointed each time . however , i am a little disappointed that i have to listen to the song again to be able to give a review on them . the singing is very choppy and the lyric are too general . i would not recommend this cd to anyone .

0	there are a few good song on this record , but the most interesting thing is the way bob dylan recorded . the way that he recorded his song , he did not make any mistake that are too noticeable . he wa very professional . he is a very good singer , and he can play the guitar . i only have one other dylan album in my collection , and i have heard this album , so it is not a problem .
0	this album is the worst ever , i do not even know how to describe how bad it is , it is just all the worst song ever
0	i just have to say here that this is the kind of music i like . i love bluegrass and i love folk ! this album is full of great song and some of the best musician i have heard in some time . i have heard some other bluegrass album and they are all ok and some of them are not that good . this is the first album in a while that i think is the best . i will say that it is not my favorite bluegrass album .
0	bought this cd in december but never got it until now . i will buy it again .

0	i have a friend who is a teacher in a private school . he is well-versed in the music of the classic . he ha the music of mozart , beethoven , chopin , and other famous composer . he is very good . my father used to play and sing the piano , and he went to a private school to learn this music . i am just a layman and do not know music , and this music is not for my ear . also , i wa at a concert a few week ago and wa impressed by the pianist on the stage , but it wa the other pianist playing the music on the piano that wa so good . i do not even know what to do with the music that i hear while driving on the highway , or in the subway . i would love to hear more music , and i would love to hear great musician to play with . there is another person in my life who ha a serious music problem and can not listen to music . i am just a plain music lover , and i do not want to listen to the same music over and over . my dad and i used to play the same song over and over and over . i have some favorite , but i really do not want to sing or play the same music over and over . i do not want to sing , play , or listen to the same song over and over . i would love to hear more music . i do not know how to explain this . i think i am a music addict , and i do not want to be one . i am a musician , i am a poet , i am a singer , i am a writer , and i am a musician . i do not want to be a music addict . i do not want to listen to the same music over and over .

1	this beatles song is really good . it is one of my favorite .
1	this schubert collection is a wonderful collection of schubert song . i have heard many different rendition of these four chord , not only by schubert , but also by other artist . there are many different interpretation of these four chord . many recording of schubert song come with these four chord , but they are often re-arranged , so you are not sure what you are hearing . this collection by schubert is a wonderful collection , containing some of the most memorable rendition of these four chord .
1	i have not listened to ray bensons cd yet , but i can say that his songwriting is good and i am sure he will deliver something great in the future .

0	the song were nice but the lyric were lame . song like tú y yo and la mujer que te amaba have nice lyric but are boring . la mujer que te amaba ha a horrible bridge . the song hasta el día ha good lyric but it ha no melody . the lyric were boring and the only thing that made me like the album is the musicianship .
1	this is a really good album . it is not my favorite , but it ha a lot great song .
1	this is a great album which i never thought i would like . it is a very mellow , peaceful , and relaxing album . it is a very good album for a relaxing sleep . the only problem is that it ha a slow and boring beginning and a fast and good middle . it is a very good album for a relaxing sleep .

1	i have bought many cd from smooth jazz and have been very pleased with them . most of his cd are very good . i have bought his cd for year and they have always been great quality .
1	this is a good rendition of the song , and is worth a download or two . if you want the original version , i would suggest purchasing it from the cd , and not from amazon . the reason i am suggesting this is that amazon claim to have the best quality of the song , and this studio recording is the best that it claim to have . they have been in business for a long time .
0	the singing here is very good , the voice is not terrible . the piano and bass are very good a well , but the drum are just a little bit off . the arrangement are very good , but the singing is a little off . the song here are very good , but the arrangement are very , very good .
1	i like them all !
1	i have not heard many rock and roll album that have the quality that this one doe . i have not heard music that make me feel a alive and passionate a this one doe . many of the selection are really good . this is a great album . the first thing that popped into my mind when i heard this album wa the name of the band , the knack .
0	i bought this cd because i like the guy . not many people know who he is . i bought this cd because i like this guy . i think it is a good cd . i do not know if it is good or not . i would not buy it again .
1	this wa a fantastic surprise . i first heard them on the radio in 2002 , but i had not heard them in year . so when i saw that they were playing in richmond , i bought their cd . i have been so disappointed and upset with their music that i have had to keep it in a closet . so when i heard that they were playing in richmond , i bought their cd . i will be buying their cd again and again . they played with a smile on their face and i really enjoyed every song . i also saw them at the blue squirrel and wa so impressed with their music that i bought their cd . i do not care what anyone else say , you can not pas up this band .
0	i had previously bought a cd by the same artist , but the cover wa not that impressive , and i think the cd wa a bit too professional looking . i would like to buy the cd again , however the cover is not so ugly after all , and the cd is a good value for the money .
0	i love the album first song , but i do not like the rest of the album . i have listened to three song , but really do not like any of them . all of them are just the same . i do not care much for the fact that they are trying to be different . this time they have really not had a good album with them . i wish they would just keep doing pop song a they have been doing for the last several album . i do not understand why they are trying to try to be something that they are not . i really do not like the way they sound . i think they do not have any new idea . they are repeating the same thing over and over . i am really disappointed with them . i will have to give this one a chance to see if i can change my opinion on it .
0	a very nice collection of music that wa well recorded . the only complaint is that some of the song are a little repetitive .
1	i wa going to buy the deluxe edition but then i saw that it did not have all the song that i liked so i just bought the album .
0	i think it is a good album , but it is not a classic . there are some good song , and some song that are really good , but some song on here are kind of boring and you can tell they are trying to make a good pop album , but they are really not . they are trying here .
1	this song wa released in 2006 and it is a positive song that wa originally released on the cd gift of angel and it is a good song .

0	i purchased this album to get away from the hype surrounding the release of this album . this album is good , but i do not understand how i could have made a mistake by buying a clean version on the itunes store .
0	a decent album by a fairly new group from the south . the first track is a good song , but there are many others that are le impressive ( for example , the middle section of sugar house is extremely repetitive and ha little to no impact ) .

1	i do not know if this is about being a mother or just a mother at the time , but i really enjoy this song . i always thought the verse wa funny , and the chorus wa kind of sad , but the bridge is so full of joy and happiness , it is kind of perfect . i have never been a fan of the chorus , but the verse is awesome .

0	this is a very good album , full of christmas music . i would recommend it to others . however , the problem i had wa that the artist wa not listed on the cd cover . the title is christmas time is here but the artist is not listed on the cd cover . i would not buy this cd if i could not see the artist name on the cd cover .

1	i have to admit that i have only heard a few of his symphony . i have listened to all of them at least once , and i think i should have listened to more . i have listened to the music of bach and beethoven , and it wa very inspiring . this music is very original , which wa really what i wa looking for .

0	i am a huge fan of rap . i have been listening to rap for year . i have never had an album that i could listen to that wa better than this one . this is one of the best rap album of the year . if you are a hip hop fan then you have to listen to this album . this is the best rap record of the year . this is not the best hip hop album of the year . this is the best of the year . this is not the best rap album of the millennium .

0	i am a long-time fan of christian music . i like band like casting crown , hillsong united , the worship collective , and many others . the singing is pretty good . i do not like the lyric because they seem to be very general . they are also very long , and very difficult to understand because they use a lot of repeated word . i have learned that to understand them , i have to be able to listen to the singer and pay attention to what they are saying . i am very disappointed with this cd . i have seen many video on youtube that are of the concert , and i have to say , they are just not good video . it is not the same a sitting in the concert hall and hearing the wonderful music . the only thing i like about the video is that they show the singer smiling , and the audience cheering . the music is good , but it is not the same a hearing it live . i am very disappointed .

0	this song is a lot of fun , however , it is a little too repetitive . too bad the lyric can not have some variation in the music . i would love it if they went back to the original version . i would like to hear the original version again .
0	the only problem with this record is that it is really boring . the music is ok but the lyric are the only good thing about the whole thing . when i first heard this album , i thought it wa really good . unfortunately , after a few listens i realized this album sucked . i think this is the worst album i have ever heard . it is boring , it is just not worth the $ 10 i paid for it .

1	i have had the cd for about two week now and i am amazed at how much i have improved since the first time i listened to it . i wa not expecting to notice much improvement . i love the instruction in this cd . i have been very fortunate to have had a singing coach in my life . i do not know how i would have improved without her . i have to say that i do not think i would have been able to do it alone !
0	i wa really excited to get this album , however , i am disappointed . i loved it before , but this album just became a bad mess . i loved the song on this album like kiss yourself and chroma and in the air and love is the way and we live forever but then there is the song like go and the king and i hate you and the song that is supposed to be the first single off of the album do it , this song wa so good but after that the album just got more and more horrible , there wa another song off this album called do it that wa so good , but then it just got a bunch of song that were just over rated or just plain dumb and that is why i wa so disappointed , i am not gon na say a bunch of song that are just over rated in my opinion because i have heard a lot of song that are over rated and they are not good song anyway , but even then the song on this album are just so dumb and they just suck . the song are fine to be sure , i mean you want a song like i hate you for example but you got a bunch of song that just do not belong . there is a song on this album called catch me that is so bad , catch me is so dumb that it just make you want to punch it out . there is a song on this album called dying that is so bad it make you want to give up your faith in god and just say well i am done . there is a song on this album called shine that is so bad that it make you want to punch it out . there is a song on the album called the good one that is so dumb it make you want to punch it out . there is a song called i love you that is so dumb it make you want to punch it out .
1	the song is all over the place . it ha one very good part and a bunch of bad part . it is hard to sing along with the music and not make the song any more enjoyable . it ha a good beat , but it is almost like he wa trying too hard to make it sound like a rock song . the song need some editing to fix the poor vocal .
0	i have not heard much of this artist before . he ha a wide variety of song on his album and there is not much really good music on the album .

1	a great compilation ! i got this album from the internet and i have been listening to it non-stop since . it is a compilation of song that are very popular at the time , but are also timeless classic . i always keep this on my must have list , and when i come across a new song i like a much a this one , i buy it . i love it when i come across a new song i like that is from the 1970s but i have never had a song like this one before .
0	it wa a good album , i will admit it ! it had a lot of good song , but there wa a lot of repetition , especially in the second half of the album . there were actually two song on this album that were just so repetitive , that i thought they were being recorded in one take .

0	i wish this wa a real live performance . i would have liked it to have more of the show feel . very disappointing a i would have liked to have seen the band interact with each other . the singer sound like they have a stage and are on stage but it is just a very dry performance . i would not say that i do not like the music but i do not think it is a real performance . i would rather listen to the music on a cd , but this is just too dry to even listen to .

1	i wa really looking forward to this album , and am very disappointed . i would have preferred a more cohesive album . too much filler and not enough substance . the song are very good , but have very little energy or enthusiasm . the production is extremely good , with very clear , well-defined vocal . i also love the interplay between the three member , and all three are very different . it is a very cohesive album . the only negative is the mediocre instrumental music that is over-produced and very annoying .
0	i listened to the song over and over and over again , and just the lyric of the song kept getting stuck in my head , and i had to figure out what they meant . when i finally figured that out , i realized that it wa cheesy . i do not like cheesy sounding material , and this song wa cheesy . i do not like cheesy sounding material .

1	i do not really listen to rap , but this is a good song . they have a good flow and they can make a song pretty quick . the one song i do not like is the song “ i do not give a damn ” because the lyric are not very original . the lyric about being a “ little messed up ” but still strong and strong enough to do what they need to do . i guess that is a good motto for them to live by . the song “ fool ” is another fast song with a good flow . i do not like rap song with a lot of word , but this one is one . i do not know who wrote the lyric , but it is not one i would change . the beat is also something i do not think i would change .

0	good album , good song , and good vocal . i wasnt surprised to find that the album did not have any original song . i guess that is to be expected , a most of these song were covered by other artist . the song are catchy but they are all the same , and that is the problem . i know that i can not be the only one who did not find the vocal to be a good a the artist on the other album . i find that i have to alter my playlist a bit to make my ear happy . i do not like to listen to the same song over and over . i have found that i actually do not . i usually have one song that i listen to over and over , and then i move on to something new . i do not mind hearing song like you will never walk alone , but all the other song are just song that are either similar to those song or they are just plain boring . the song on this album are repetitive , the song are boring , and the vocalist are all just like the other one . i can not say why , but it just did not work for me . i like song that have a little spice to them . i liked i will be missing you but it is just a song that just seems like it wa made for a christmas album . so it did not really grab me .

0	i really liked this album . although they were not the best singer , they did a nice job on the song and the lyric are very well-written .
0	love this cd ! there is just something about these song , especially the one that clint eastwood wrote . they get inside your head and make you feel like you are in his movie . so many great song and yet only five or six of them are really sung . i enjoy listening to these western song and it make a great background music for my computer in the office . i also like the fact that it doe not have any country or bluegrass , which i like . i do not expect this to be a classic western , but i do expect it to be a good one . i like the fact that it is a compilation of song and not a western album . i am not sure how good it will be when i have to listen to all of these song every day , but it is a good start . this is a great cd , not only for western music , but for western artist . i bought this to listen to while i wa on a business trip and it really helped me get through the trip . i highly recommend this cd .

1	this album wa a good listen . i really enjoyed it . i am not a big fan of her music , but i did like this album . the song are a good mix of different style . i like that there are not very many song with one type of style and then the next style . i am not a big fan of her style , but i like this style . i like the song that she sings . the only reason i gave a 5 is because i did not really like the song that she sings . i did not like the song that were on this album . i do not think i could get into her music . it is just not my style . it is not my favorite . i do not really like her music . she is just different and i do not know who she is .

1	ray benson play western swing music and ha a way of making it feel very personal and special , his music is very intimate and emotional , and his playing is so natural it sound like he is singing to you . ray is the best western swing musician i know and i believe the reason he is so successful is that he is a master at crafting a musical blend that is more than just western swing , but a musical journey that take you through the heart of a song and into the soul of the artist . ray benson ha crafted a very well-crafted , quality musical blend that may possibly be the best western swing cd ever recorded .

1	i do not remember where i first heard this band . i do remember hearing them play in a small club in my college town in the late 90 . they played an acoustic set consisting of their original song and some cover . i can not really remember the name of the band but i know they were pretty good . i bought the cd on the band own website and i have listened to it on and off for the past 5 year . i love the sound of the band music and i do not think that they have ever lost their edge .

1	lin manuel miranda is one of the greatest singer to ever come out of the united state . in addition to his amazing singing ability , he is also one of the most talented composer and lyricist . lin manuel miranda ha a voice that is impossible to describe . for a guy who can actually sing and write , he ha a voice , and he need to give credit where it is due . the musical arrangement are the best i have ever heard , and he certainly deserves all the credit for making this album . i am a song is a great song ; it is a fantastic love song , and you can not argue with that . this album is a big , big deal , and it is definitely worth the money .

1	it is been a while since i have seen a clint eastwood movie that i actually enjoyed . this one , though , did not disappoint . eastwood is actually very watchable a he take on the villainous role of the evil gangster . there wa a solid mystery at the beginning that wa very well done . the movie took a twist at the end , but , again , it wa well done and the ending wa satisfactory ( even though it wa a bit abrupt ) .

0	this is a little difficult a i have a thing for the music of the grateful dead and the band just released a new album , so i wa excited to check it out . the music wa solid , especially if you are a deadhead . some of the song i did not like and it just seemed to be the same album over and over , but those are minor detail . the problem is that the band is very loud and the recording wa so poor . the song were recorded with an old tape machine that made them sound muddy and not great . the vocal sounded like the band wa coming out of a swimming pool and the band sounded like they were on drug . the music wa fine , but the sound of the instrumentals had a lot of distortion . you would think that the band would have recorded better , but they decided to record for a dollar . this is really the only negative thing i can say about this album . the band is awesome and i would buy any of their album , but this one is a little disappointing .
1	this song wa the first song on the cd , i bought it to have with my wife . i love the message , and i love the music , but i did not love the song a much a i thought i would . i have not listened to any of the song for a while now , and this one is my new favorite .

1	great song , well played and sung .
0	i wish i had found this year ago when i wa in high school , and i did the same thing with the first song on the cd . i liked the voice and i liked the song , but i wa turned off by the overuse of some of the word and the unnecessary use of the word bitch and it seemed like the vocalist tried to be something she wa not , and that really offended me . her performance and vocal were not bad , but the song wa overused . i really wish she had not used the word bitch so much . i wa glad when i realized the lyric were not hers , but i wa turned off by her use of the word bitch and i thought maybe she wa trying to be something she wa not , and that really offended me . i could hear what she wa saying , but it wa not what the song wa saying . i think a lot of people misunderstood her lyric , and i think that is what offended me . i wa glad when i realized the lyric were not hers , and i wa turned off by her use of the word bitch
0	a very well put together package . i have listened to the first half an hour already , and it ha a lot of good song on it . i am not sure what is going on with the last couple of song . i have heard the name of it somewhere before , so i hope that is all it is .
1	i love jewel . i thought she wa an amazing singer . i do not know why she sang that song that first time . i have never heard that song or her singing like that . i really hope that she will come back someday . i think she is a beautiful singer and an amazing person , but i do not think she can sing like she used to sing . i hope she will come back someday and sing again , but i do not know if she will . i will probably buy the cd until it is over .

0	schubergers singing is a bit thin sounding . the singing is good but the voice is a bit thin . the song are okay , but the voice is a bit thin .

0	i purchased this for my wife to listen to on a long car trip , and she enjoyed it . i did not think about it again until i watched the commercial on television . i like what i heard . i do not think i will buy the accapella version .

0	i am a huge fan of country singer and this one stand out to me because of the way it flow . i understand that the song wa written by a woman but she sings it in a way that is very different from the way that country singer would sing it . i am not disappointed with this cd because this is a good cd but i am curious to hear the song live . it is not the type of song that i would expect to hear live . i have never been a fan of country music but i do respect it .

1	what can i say about this album , it is casting crown . i really like this album . it provides a lot of entertainment . i bought the album to listen to while driving . i can not say it is the best album i have ever purchased . the only problem i have with this album is that it includes some song that i do not like . if you are expecting something to be very good , you will not be disappointed . if you are expecting something to be bad , you will not be disappointed . the only problem i have with this album is that it includes a song that i do not like . i would recommend you to skip this album .

1	an excellent album , especially the last portion which show how an artist can be totally oblivious to a lot of thing .
1	this cd is a compilation of r. kelly best hit . he wa a huge influence on me at the time and i fell in love with his music . the song maggies farm is pretty great . the rest of the song are average . this album is really well played , and the song are all well arranged . his voice sound great , and i can hear just how great he wa at singing . i would give this album a five star rating .
1	i bought a 99 reiseback copy of this cd for 99 cent . i got it a a gift and listened to it for about an hour . it is a very good cd . it is not for everyone and i think it is not the best for everyone . i think you may have to have more than one cd before you find what you are looking for . i like the harmony on this cd . the instrumentals are nice . i like the music . i have never had a cd of classical music that ha been so much fun to listen to .
1	the beatles were pretty good , but if you are a fan of r & b music , the music from the 60 and 70 will prove to be very nice .
1	this song is not bad !
1	i love to listen to rock music .
1	after a couple of listens , i am in love with the opera . i have always loved opera , but i have never heard anything quite like this opera . so much beauty and such a great voice . i have heard the opera a couple of other time and it wa not nearly a good a this one . i can not wait to order more . i do not think i will ever be able to get enough of this opera .
1	i bought this cd for my husband . he is enjoying it .
0	i bought the album and it wa ok. i do not have any problem with the song , but what really impressed me wa the album packaging . this wa the only album with a real jewel case . the others were just a box , with the music inside .

0	this album doe not seem to be a good a most of his other album . the song that are good are all over the place . i like the album concept and i like the music so i will keep listening . but i just really do not like this album .
0	i did not like this song . it is pretty bad .
0	i bought aint no pussy no because i thought it wa a fun record , but it wa not . the song ha a nice beat and the lyric are decent , but the song is missing some beat and the vocalist ha a very nasally voice . the album is a bit boring , but the song is just okay . i am not sure this is one of ozzies best .
0	i bought this album because i had no idea what the hell wa going on and thought it would be a good soundtrack to life . it is not . i wa expecting more , but still , it is interesting . it is an album you need to hear at least 5 time to get the full effect .
0	i did like the music a lot .
0	i bought this cd a long time ago and it is still my favorite . i wish i would have bought more song before i went to listen to the entire cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	this cd is great . i am glad i found it .
0	i have listened to this album about 20 time , and it is still great . i like the song on this album . it is very unique to listen to . i like how different some of the song are . i am surprised it is so different from title because it really is . i have only listened to title a couple of time and i did not really get what this album wa talking about . i mean title is different , but this album is different . the song are different , the style are different , and the genre are different . i am not really a fan of rap , but i am not a fan of pop either . when i listen to this album , the song are very repetitive , but the repetition is part of the unique style of the song . the other thing that i do not like about this album is that it doe not really have any new lyric . it ha about 7 song that have lyric , and the rest are just the repetitive music . the only good thing about this album is that it is a great party album .
0	i thought this wa a really good song . it is not a bad song , but i do not think it is their best .
0	this band is really good . i do not know if i like them .
0	i am a fan of hall and oat , and this album wa one of my first purchase . i have listened to it several time since my first purchase , it is fun , and interesting . the song are not too long or too short , they are just good . i like how the vocal are in a mix with the musician so that the vocal do not get drowned out by the instrument . the music , while not being great , it is good . i find the lyric are simple , yet still have a meaning to them . i think the music is fine , and it is good quality , but the lyric are what i like to listen to . i think the song would be nice on a cd , but i like the way the lyric are spoken . i would recommend it , because it is fun , and relaxing . the cd last a long time , and you can listen to it over and over . it is a good cd to play in the car . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like hall and oat music .

1	this cd ha some of the best song of the year . all of the song are great .
0	i am offended by this cd . every song is about god . i have listened to this cd for about 2 week and i have never been so offended by any cd in my life . the song and lyric are too offensive . the word are too blasphemous to be used in any manner of christian music . god is not mentioned in any song , but then again i do not believe in god .
1	this is the second album by mumford that i have heard . the first wa an album called mumford , which wa a great album . i did not like this album , however . this album contains song that are very repetitive and sound like they have been recorded by just one person . i do not think that this is the best album by mumford , because of the song that are repetitive . i would recommend this for people who like the alternative/rock genre .

1	i love it . it is the third cd by this awesome band that i have bought . the first two were very good , but the new one is more in my opinion . the band just need to keep the same energy and passion that they had when they were first starting out . after having bought the cd already , i am going to buy more so i can get every song . this is the best cd to buy that i have had so far . i am very glad that i bought this one . i can not wait to buy the next cd .

0	i really liked this song . this song is awesome .
0	i have always been a fan of eminem , but i thought this album wa just another of his mellow song . not the case . i liked the original album better . it wa more of a rock and roll album . i liked this album , but the music is very basic and i just did not like it . it is just a lot of song that are dull and boring and not very good . the original album is much better and i would have liked to hear it . the cover art is nice , but it is just the same old stuff that you would expect to hear . i would not recommend this album to anyone . just like the original album , it is just another nice album .
1	i bought one copy of this and i love it . i listen to the whole album every day .
1	this song ha always been my favorite song to sing at the top of my lung , i really love the word to this song , it is one of my favorite song of all time . i would have loved to have written this song but i never really know who wrote the song . i will always have this song with me and i will always love singing this song at the top of my lung .

0	this is the third and final song on the album . i like the second half of the album , especially the song that have a dancing feel to them . this song is kind of boring , and doe not really have anything new to offer . i would give it a 6 or 7 .

0	this album is great , but i thought the vocal sounded a little odd . i did not like the way they were singing the lyric . i prefer the original .
1	the album is a lot of fun , and i am glad i made the effort to listen to it . it is got a little bit of everything in it . i like the opening song beggin , borrowin & rockin and a few others . the first song ha some nice lyric and the last song is a good song . i wouldnt put it a a favorite though . i will listen to it again . i think it worth a listen but not a good a other album by this artist . i would say this is a good album to check out if you like rap and hip hop .
0	this cd is a great addition to any classical music collection . the cd doe not have all the song of the original cast recording , so this is not a full performance of the song . the cd is a good representation of the song and is a good alternative to listening to the original cast recording .
1	wow ! this is a great cd . i love it !

0	twiztid . i really like their newer song but those that i have heard i have not liked . i do see why they are so popular though ! i am not saying all of them are not good but most of them are not ! especially the song that are similar to other artist . the music just is not there and i really do not like it . i think it is a waste of their talent though .
1	i really like these song . i got the cd for my daughter ( who is a very good singer ) and she love them . the song are very good .
1	this is the best album of the two .
0	i am a little bitter , because they did not listen to my other cd . i played your cd on my home stereo and wa in awe with the sound . i had some trouble with song such a : let the worshiper arise it is a shame that the cd wa packaged in a very cheap looking jewel case . i am not a huge fan of the jewel case , but i liked the cd-case so i thought i would give it a shot and play it . it wa very disappointing . i am guessing that the cd wa in a more expensive jewel case that the cd-case . the quality of the cd sounded very poor , it seemed a if the cd wa scratched a lot a well . it sounded very dull . i am really not giving 5 star because of the jewel case . i would only give it 1 star based on the quality of the cd .
0	i really like the song , but it is so cray like . i can not get past the lyric .
0	i bought the first 2 song in the collection on this one . i liked it . the third one is not a good a the first two . it wa nice though .

1	raybensons music is wonderful !
0	this is a very good album and it is a shame that it is one long song .
1	i have no idea who this artist is , but i like his music . the song i love the most is back to reality . i have to listen to this album more than once to get good at it .
0	loved this , a good a the others .
0	i like this song because it is a great song !
0	there is a great deal of schubert here . the cello work are all wonderful . there are a few mediocre cello work in this collection , but there is nothing that is truly awful .
0	i am not an twiztid fan , and i am really sorry . i have listened to this album twice already and i love what he doe , but there is just too much mediocrity . the rap are okay , but the production is just a mess . i love the vocal and how twiztid can use his voice in both a high and low range . what a waste of a good artist .
1	i do not know if this is a good or bad album , that is for you to decide . it seems to me , that if you are not with u , you are against u is the message that is intended to be sent throughout the album . i am not sure that this wa the best way of spreading this message , but i am sure the message wa meant to be heard . if you are against something , you are against it . if you are for something , you are for it . there is an old saying , if you are not with u , you are against u which mean that you are against something because you do not agree with the way that we are doing thing . the problem then becomes the question of who is actually against the way that we are doing thing , and how do we make sure that we are all in agreement with one another . i know that this is a question that is in some aspect of our control , but it is a difficult one to answer , because it is impossible to agree on everything . at the end of the day , what we do is what we do . the problem then becomes that if you do not agree with the way that we are doing thing , then you are not with u anymore . i believe that this album wa designed to show what it is that we do not agree on . this album ha the same problem that the song barely there had . it is a song that i believe the same thing a the song barely there . i do not think that it is a good thing that this song wa made , but i am sure that it wa made because that is the way that it wa meant to be . i do not think that this song wa made to be liked , but i am sure that it wa made to be liked so that i knew that i did not agree with them . the same problem with barely there wa with barely there ( live at madison square garden ) . while i do not like this song , i am sure that it wa made to be liked so that i knew i did not agree with them . i do not think that this song wa made to be popular , but i am sure that it wa made to be popular so that i knew that i did not agree with them . this is the same problem that barely there ( live at madison square garden ) had . it is a song that i believe the same thing a the song we have only just begun and barely there ( live at madison square garden ) . i do not think that these song were made to be liked , but i am sure that they were made to be liked so that i knew i did not agree with them , and so that i knew i did not agree with them . if you were going to talk to someone about this album and tell them that it wa a good album that wa not made to be liked , then you would be telling the truth . if you were going to talk to someone about this album and tell someone that it wa a good album that wa not made to be liked , and you were going to tell them that you did not agree with the way that they are doing thing , then you would be telling the truth .
1	i love this album . i think it is by far the best album of 2009. i love the song and the vocal .
0	i thought this album wa pretty good . the song that i did not like were i need a girl and i will do the same thing . these two song are not that bad , but they are not that good either . they are not that good , but i am glad that they did not make the list .
0	i donnot like this song at all . i thought it wa stupid and boring . i do not even know why i listened to it .

0	i have both cd of meghan trainors new album . i like the first cd , but i do not like the new one . i like the new song better than the first one . that is not to say i do not like the first one , but i do not like the new one . i think i like the first two song better than the new one . i would probably recommend this album to just about anyone .
0	if you like the sound of this song , you will like the sound of this song .
0	i like the way schubert is trying to communicate the same message to u that many of u have tried to express at one time or another . if you have ever been in a situation where all you had wa a positive attitude , then you will definitely enjoy this collection . it is almost like a compilation of a person life experience . not to mention that the composer is a person like you who ha suffered and who ha seen others suffer .
0	not bad at all . this is the first cd i have listened to from this group . the song are not a good a the two previous album but still worth a listen .
1	the beat is great . i like the song very much .
1	the song is a love letter to god . the melody is very simple , but the lyric are very intricate and well-written . the lyric are uplifting and encourage you to trust in god .
1	the lyric are kinda cheesy , but the voice is alluring .
1	good music for the older fan .
0	i am a music lover and have been looking for a cd that i could listen to constantly for hour . i have heard many cd in this genre and i have been disappointed time and again . i have even listened a few of the very best choral cd on the market ( i am sure some of these are good ) but in the end , i am back to waiting for something to satisfy my musical need . this cd is what this search ha been looking for !
0	i am a big fan of this band . i am glad that i wa able to discover them . i buy every album by this group . i am not sure if you will like their music ; however , i would suggest that you give it a listen .
1	this is my second cd from the band and i like it very much . it ha some excellent song and some really great one .
0	i have been listening to this cd for the past 7 day and i just have not been able to get past the horrible music . it appears that the vocal and the music are the same , but the cd is not .
0	if you go into this album expecting a hipster band like the white stripe or the decemberists , you can expect to be disappointed . however , it is a decent listen and the music is a good change of pace from the most popular music out there . i think it is a very underrated album . definitely worth a listen .
0	i really enjoyed this album ! i liked the fact that she wa able to write a new song in the same time it took for her to write the last four . i also enjoyed the simplicity and the way schubert wa able to express his love for his wife . i have to say though , i do not think i could listen to this song with my wife . i find that it just make me sound like i wa thinking about her . i feel bad that i wa listening to this with her while she wa sleeping . i feel like i should have been listening to it anyway .
1	the drum are awesome and really make this a great song . really like the arrangement by david campbell .

0	it ha a good beat , but it is not a good a the other song in the album .
1	this is definitely one of my favorite cd of the year so far . it is a bit of a departure for me because i usually do not like classical music . the cd is full of classical music , jazz , and r & b . i like the fact that they have their music in all three style . the cd open with a track by r. kelly and the song is so amazing . the song on this cd are easy to follow , and they are not difficult to understand . i like the fact that they keep the music simple . they have a lot of classical music , which i really enjoy . the cd ha a lot of great song . i especially like the song laid on the same bed by michael jackson . it always make me happy when i have a good song playing in the background . the cd ha a good variety of song . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like classical music .
0	i love the song on this cd . i love it . i love the song .
0	i have listened to this album many time , it is a bit like the way i listen to album . what stand out to me is the very good song on the soundtrack , the man with the iron fist .

0	i bought this album because i love the producer and he is really talented . i am still waiting to hear how it fit into my life . it is very generic and ha no real purpose . it doe not contain anything new and interesting . i would recommend it to people who are looking for something in their life that ha no real purpose , like a pop album . i am not going to waste my money on a pop album

1	this album ha a great mix of style and voice .
0	this wa the best cd that i have ever listened to . it wa very enjoyable and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone . i would buy it in a heartbeat if i could not find it on amazon for $ 23.99 .

0	this is very good christmas music . i would recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for a christmas album . the problem i had with this cd wa that i did not know what it wa , but i liked the music . if you are looking for christmas music , this is the cd to buy .
0	the band consists of john mceuen on vocal , ray benson on guitar and vocal , and the late joe spivey on bass . mceuen is a very talented musician and his voice and guitar style is very unique . the band ha a great sound , and i like that they play bluegrass and swing , and they play the song that you love .

0	i am a drummer in a local band . i wa given an opportunity to play a gig with a national act , a band that is called silly love affair . they were going to send a bass player to the gig , and i wa supposed to fill in if the bass player wa not available . i wa going to take the bass player on tour with me if he wasnt available , but i wa never told about this , so i went along with it . i have been playing the drum since i wa 12 , and i have been playing with several local band for the past 10 year . i have worked with some amazing drummer , and some not so amazing one . the problem is that i have no direction and can not seem to find the one that i want . i played in a local band for the past 10 year , and have worked with many different local band . i have been playing the drum since i wa 12 , and the other musician feel that i am a liability . so , i guess , i must get a drummer and see what happens . i am hoping that it just happens soon . i am hoping this is not the last time we encounter one another .

0	they have been putting out album since 2001 , so i thought this album would be different , but i do not think they have been able to improve on it . it ha all the same song from the previous album . the only improvement is the production , which is still solid . just annoying .

0	i had my doubt when i first heard the song , but after listening to it i actually agree with the author . i can not say i really liked the song when i first heard it , but it is a bit more mature and more like the song meghan and trainor have done in the past . i never really understood why the band wa originally called twiztid , but whatever . i can say i will be sad to see them go .
1	this is one of the best song on the album . the lyric are so sad and so touching . i would love to sing it to somebody , but i think i would cry and then i would want to sing it and it would make me cry more . i just listen to the song and get emotional . i am glad i bought it because now i can enjoy it every time i listen to it .

0	i have been a fan of the song and album for a long time , but this album is a bit of a disappointment . the album is very hard to get through . i had no problem understanding it , but the song are only a few line long . the song are not that long and so are not that complex . there are 2 song of two minute each . maybe the song would have been better if they were shorter , but that is not the fault of the song . i think the whole album is over-produced and the vocal are poor .

1	first song on the first amazon cd i ever purchased , and it doe not even begin to compare to the song i have bought from them since . they have never let me down . they are always professional . i have been to their headquarters in nashville , they have always been very professional , and the people there are great . i love them . i purchased this song for my niece on christmas . i do not understand why they do not sell this song in the store . they put it on the shelf a christmas and when she asked to buy it for her niece , they told her it wa christmas and not available for sale . then she got to the pay site to see that it wa available for sale . at that point she went into a fit . she demanded that the manager return the entire cd to them and to cancel all future order . i asked the manager to call her back to tell her that they had a new cd coming out and that this cd wa not available for sale to the public . they refused to do that . they would not return the cd to her . she got a call from the customer service number asking her to return the cd to them . i did . i returned it to them . they had to send it back and then they sent her another cd . the next cd she received wa this one . she still did not like it , but she had gotten used to it .
0	this album is what is wrong with today music market . it is a song to get you so fucking high that you get sick . it ha no redeeming quality at all .
0	a few note about the performance - the lead vocalist wa not that great . the backup singer were very good . the piano wa playing at a very quiet level which made for a very intimate experience . i wa disappointed in the recording . the sound quality wa pretty good , but the vocal and the overall sound were pretty bad . i would not recommend this to someone who is not looking for a great sound .
1	this is my personal favorite album of all time . i have bought this cd twice and am just listening to it one more time . it is a great album .
0	ray first album is excellent .
0	if you are looking for an easy , relaxing , and entertaining way to spend a few minute , this may be the right fit for you . the music is very relaxing , and the story is very entertaining . but the story is not really about the music . it is about the main character and his journey .

1	clint eastwoods wa a great actor . he did a good job .
1	i downloaded this album and i really liked it . i thought it wa really great and i think it is a good song to go to when you are riding in a car and you want to pump up the volume and turn up the volume . i like that song and it is a really good song to go to when you are walking around and singing and screaming . i think it is a good song to go to when you are walking .

0	this is not schubert best work , but it is a nice collection .
0	i love the flow of the song and the lyric . however , the production is very dull . it sound like it wa recorded in a studio rather than out in the real world . the beat doe not sound right . the song is very uninteresting and i can not stand the repetitive chorus . i thought this song wa much better on the first listen but the second time around i found it to be very uninteresting .
0	this is not a very good album .
1	i listen a lot to this band and i listen to this album a lot too .

0	i enjoy listening to jewel and i think she is one of the greatest singer that ever lived . she is one of the reason i started listening to jazz .
0	he is a man who know how to make a good , catchy album . the song the end is a great song , with great lyric and a perfect melody , but the chorus is a little too much . the end is a very short song , which is nice , but too short , to be a song , it should be a song , with a longer chorus . on the other hand , rise is a great song , but the lyric are not a good a the song , the end . i am sure some people will have nothing but good thing to say about this album , but for me , it is not perfect .
0	the song doe not really stand out from the rest of the song on the album . it is just a little over the top . the cover is kinda cheesy .

0	i love the music but this cd is just not very well designed . this is a problem not only with the packaging , but also the cd itself . the artwork is terrible . one of the song ha the same lyric on it a the song on the cd . the cd open with the opening theme and then the cover art . the cover art is very small and hard to read . the song themselves are small . the lyric are too long . they do not flow very well . the cd sound too similar to each other . a a result , the song get lost in the shuffle . overall , this is a terrible cd .

0	this is a cd of mostly symphony ( and a few concerto ) by schubert . the cd is not of high quality . the cd is in the same plastic case a i have had in the past . the cd is in the top half of the box , with the rest of the cd and the booklet .
0	i liked this song , but the last 4 line are a little too much .
0	i received this album last friday for free . i am very disappointed in this product . i got all four of the song and i must say that they are not bad . i just do not like the music on this album . it is not bad , but it is not a good a i wa expecting . the song are all the same , and they are very repetitive . there are no surprise track or real surprise in the music . the album is too samey and it is too boring to listen to . i am looking forward to the next twiztid album , but i think i am going to stop buying their album again .

1	i am a former fan of this band . i bought their album on cd . it is well worth the money . the sound quality is really good . it is well worth the money . there is a lot of good music . i give it a 9.5 .
0	this is a compilation of different style of music that were performed by meghan trainor . i liked the opening song , chasing the dragon ( which is the first song with a beat per se , ) but the rest of it wa just filler for me . i am not sure why i am not liking this cd , but i guess i will have to listen to it more often just to listen to the lyric and see what i can learn . i think i need to listen to her music more often just to listen the lyric and see what i can learn from them . i am still trying to figure out all of the song on this cd .
0	i think that this song wa really good .
0	i think this album is a little better than the one with marcello and giorgio moroder , but the song are very repetitive , and it is a little bit too much .

1	i love listening to bill withers . it really is a great album .
0	i wa surprised that i liked this cd . i guess i am just a sucker for something with a classical sound . i wa very happy with this cd . i like it .
0	all of the song play on repeat without skipping . i usually like to have the lyric to help me remember the word so i know what song is currently playing . i wa also pleased that there wa a cd of the previous album . i always wanted to hear the first album , but i did not want to pay $ 15 for 2 cd . the next album is also available , and i am sure i would enjoy listening to it a much a this one .

0	not much to say about this album . very good song . i guess i have never heard of this band until now , so it wa a little weird to listen to a record i have never heard of . but , i love this band , so i guess i had to give it a chance . what more can you ask for ?

1	i think this is one of those song that you sing with your eye closed and your nose is to the sky .
1	this song is my favorite song from this album .
0	i bought the cd because i liked the album and thought they had some interesting thing on the new album . i would have loved to have heard more . i did not like the big day . i listened to it a a kid and thought it wa cool . what a let down .
0	the first time i tried to listen to this song , i wa not impressed . i do not think i wa able to tell the difference between the original and this version .

1	i am very happy with my purchase of this song .
0	the second song on the album is really good and i like it , but i think i might put it away now just for the sake of getting more of the first half of the album .
0	i really like this cd . i like the positive lyric . it ha a nice , relaxing sound .
0	this cd ha a few thing going for it but overall i do not think it is all that good . the song are not very different from one to another . the cd start off with a song called aint that the way it is and it is a good song . from there it includes when the saint go marching in which is a good song .
1	i just saw the movie iron man and i love it ! my girlfriend and i just bought the soundtrack and i can not stop playing it .
1	: this album ha some good song .
1	i think that this song wa the best on the album . the music to this song is fantastic , the lyric are great and the chorus of this song is just perfect .
0	i really like his music and he is very talented .
1	this song really get me pumped . it is a great song for the time i feel like i have not got any energy to do anything .
1	first i would never heard of him and i will admit that he did play a song for me during the first concert and i wa pleasantly impressed . i have only heard his music once in my life but i think that is why i am not a fan . i feel like i am having a conversation with myself when i listen to his music . my wife and i agreed that he wa not a good singer . i did like the song that he played for me . it wa called b.t.w . i do not know if it wa a song by the beatles or not but it sounded like it . i would like to hear more of his music .
0	this is an excellent album . i love the music of this opera .
0	i enjoy the song but i do not find anything good about this cd .
0	this collection is a mish-mosh of different genre and style of music , from the mainstream to the underground . there is no real cohesive sound , especially with the exception of the song that are the same genre ( i.e . the pop-punk oriented rock the vote and the new york groove of dancefloor-oriented house music ) . it is a shame because the song here do have some redeeming quality , especially the lead single , we are the native , which is a great , catchy song with a great hook and message . rock the vote on the other hand is a good song with a good message and sound , but it is basically an anti-obama song that doe not really add anything to the album . and the last song on the album , new york groove , is basically an extended club song with some lyric about how great it is to be from new york . but like all of the song on this album , it is all over the place and there is nothing about it that make it worth listening to .
0	i bought this album for my son and i am very upset with it . it is full of song that i have not heard in year and some of the lyric are so offensive . i have not listened to this album since i purchased it . i do not think it is any good or worthy of being on my son cd collection . i hope this doe not cause him to be embarrassed . i do not think it is fair to me to be forced to listen to such bad music by his father favorite artist . i hope that he is able to enjoy the collection i put in his room with the song i own and will purchase for him .
1	so i wa listening to thalia for the first time . i wa amazed at how good it wa . i could not believe how good it wa . i kept listening to it . i had to have the cd . i wa not impressed with the way it wa performed . it wa all good but the vocal were not good . i did not buy it . i have heard it a few more time and have not bought it . i have bought other christian cd and they are all good or better than the one i buy . i do not know what to think about the cd . i am not going to pay for it . i do not know what to think . i think it is a great cd . i think it is a good cd . i think it is a great disc . i think it is a good disc . i think it is a good disc . i think they are all good .
0	i don like this album . i do not like this music . i like the song called i have got a little time on my hand but i do not like the album in general . i do not like the cd cover . i do not like the cd . i do not think it is very good . i do not like the song on this cd . i do not like this cd . i do not like this album . i do not like this cd . i do not like the cd cover . i do not think it is very good . i don like the song on this cd . i don like this cd . i do not like the cd cover .
0	i would not buy this song . i would not buy this song .
0	the only thing good about this album is the song . the lyric are boring and i do not want to hear any further about his life .
1	this is the song that will make you cry . i love this song and this review . i think i love this song more than the movie .
1	this is an all-time favorite of mine . i wa a big fan of the grateful dead , but i never really liked the dead until i heard this cd . when i first heard this cd , i thought it wa so-so . after i listened to it , i said that it wa one of the top 5 album i had ever listened to . it is a great mix of electric and acoustic guitar playing . you can hear a big band sound , and you can also hear a great mix of acoustic and electric guitar playing . this cd ha some really great song , but it also ha some really bad song too . i would recommend this to a friend .
1	this is my favorite of the movie soundtrack album . the music is so beautiful and beautiful and full of hope , and it is very easy to listen to .
0	i am not a fan of alternative rock , but i love this album . it ha a great variety of music , and the lyric are great .

1	i like the cd . i like the song . i like the song . i like the cd . i like the song .
0	it is a good cd , but i do not know if i would recommend it to others .
0	i would say this is a rapper who can rap and sing . these song sound like the guy from scream but with more hook . these song contain a lot of different musical element and they are all very catchy . they are all great . i think they make a great cd .
1	i love this song ! i really like this song ! this song is great ! this is an awesome song !
0	i am very pleased with this cd . the song are great , and i really enjoyed the music .
1	this song make me cry .
1	a a fan of eminem in general , i have to say this is the best album out of his career . i have always liked his early work but i am starting to come around again to his later work . this album is a good album . i can not get enough of it . i have listened to it over and over and over . this album is a great album . i would recommend it to anyone . i listen to it everyday !
0	eminem is more entertaining than the average rapper . the album is good but the song are bad .
0	there is nothing wrong with this album . i enjoy the music .
0	i can not believe that this is it . after hearing it , i have to say that it is a very disappointing album . the album started off strong , and i wa really looking forward to listening to it . the problem is that it went downhill from there . and that is something that i do not usually have an issue with , but this album just wa not very good . it started off with a great song , you are a star , and then there are a couple of song that are really good , the only one and mama , mama , mama . but then all of a sudden it just did not sound right and just went downhill from there . it just seemed a little too much of a party album in my opinion . this is not a bad album , in fact it is probably the best of all of naughty by nature album . but it just did not have the good song .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker .
1	i love it and i like it .
0	i received the album the real thing by the duo that brought u the real thing . i have to say , the album sounded good on the first listen but after a second listen the album had lost it is edge . the album is not bad , just not what i wa hoping for . the only redeeming factor about this album is the song how we do it which ha a great hook but is not used very often .
1	this is an all-time classic . the vocal are beautiful and the arrangement are very nice . the album is great and i would recommend it to anyone who is a christian .
1	the cd is good for the price .
0	this song is a joke . i do not know why i have purchased this album . it is just a song , it doe not have anything of value to offer me whatsoever . i just bought it because i like to listen to some jazz .
1	this cd ha some really interesting new material . i think it is a great cd . i would recommend this cd to western swing fan .
1	i have read this book and it is well written .
1	the band is definitely underrated . they are great live and just seem to have a sense of style and rhythm that make them stand out from the other band in the genre . i have always enjoyed the music of this band and i am happy to have discovered them . i would also like to see them live again .
0	lately i have been putting this in my car stereo . i like listening to the new music coming out by hip hop artist like j. cole , kendrick lamar , and drake . i also like listening to the other artist that make up the rap scene , such a na , eminem , and jay-z .
0	i really enjoyed the compilation . i have listened to it a lot .
1	i love her music . i just downloaded the album for my ipod .
1	i love this cd . it is very entertaining and very well sung . i am very happy with this purchase and will purchase the cd next week !
1	i have not been able to get this cd to play on my ipod . i have tried everything . doe anyone have any suggestion ?
0	this is very nice , but it is not very good .
0	good song . the only thing i would like to see is more instrument included in this song , instead of just the piano . it is a bit too soft for my taste .
1	i love this song and this cd is a must have . it is my favorite song of all time . i am so glad to have this cd .
1	i like the way the song are arranged . the first song is nice , the second song is nice , and the last song is nice , too . overall , i like the cd , and i enjoy the arrangement of the song . there is a lot of talent in this cd .
1	this reviewer liked this song , said , . this song wa very very powerful . i wa sitting in church and sang this song and my whole body wa shaking . i love how this song make you feel when you sing it . i would love to see other people sing this song in church and church across the nation .
0	this is the best cd i have bought . i am a huge fan of bob dylan . this is his biggest hit .
1	this is a great album and i can not find anything that is wrong with it . i absolutely love it and i will never forget it . this is the best album of meghans career . i love her voice and her music . i hope this will be the last album that we hear from her . hopefully the next album that come out will be a step forward for her .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i bought the cd when it wa first released a a promotional cd for the band first album , and i wa very surprised by the quality of the cd . i think that some of the song were better than the first one ( although the first one wa my favorite ) .
0	i have a very strong preference for kelly voice , so i would like to say that this song is one of her best . however , i am not sure if you are a fan of kelly voice or not , but if this is really the best song , then i do not know what to say .
0	very good , but not my favorite new album . the song are good , but the album is very short and you can not really get a lot of enjoyment from it .
1	i bought this cd because i wa tired of waiting for this to come out . i can not believe that we have so many great clint eastwoods cd . all of his song are good , and i love his acting . this wa a great gift , and i thank you for your time .
0	i have listened to a lot of classical music over the year , but it doe not get much better than this . the only thing i have to complain about is that the piano note are so loud . it doe not stop the music from being enjoyable . the other thing i liked wa that the note were mixed in rather than being played out one at a time . it made the music sound more continuous for me . i did hear a few time where it sounded like someone wa playing the piano instead of the note .
1	i really enjoy listening to these song . the lyric are very powerful and well thought out .
1	i am a big fan of danzig , and this album is one of his finest . this album is great in every way .
0	after listening , i can not say anything negative about the music . it is good , but it is not good enough to be on my top 10 list .
1	i bought it for my roommate to listen to while he or she is at work .
0	this album is so disappointing . in fact , it is so disappointing that i am going to send this album to the library . i have literally listened to it four time . i have heard it once and will not listen to it again .
0	another song i got from an amazon download and it is good , but i can not figure out why i bought it . i do not really like the chime that is heard in the background , it is a little irritating .
1	i would have to say that this album is great and i would highly recommend it to people who love music . this album is great .
0	i am not a fan of this song . it ha a very generic , generic , generic , generic , generic , generic , generic , generic , and generic sound to it . i am not impressed with this song .

0	i would recommend this album . good song and production .
0	this album ha a lot of good song . i like this album .
0	an album a little on the boring side . maybe because of the constant use of electric guitar . but the production wa great . i would love to hear more of this artist . they have created a sound that is a little out of the ordinary .

0	the first time i listened to this album , i thought this guy could really sing . then i heard one of his song , lonely man and i have to say he sound like a total asshole . and this album will just fill the hole you have left in your heart . if you are looking for a singer with a lot of soul , this is probably not the album for you . i will say , however , that he ha a lot of talent to sing . it is just the song that are just completely boring .
0	i am so picky about what i like that i listened to this a hundred time before i bought it . i have heard it a billion time . it is so boring , repetitive , and ha no personality whatsoever . i would have rather bought a cd of the latest hit single by a band i like .
0	i bought this cd because i liked the review of it on a website . i liked the song and so i bought it . i have not listened to the cd , but i am looking forward to it .
1	this is one of the best opera i have heard . for an opera to be this great , it is important that it be sung and it is . thalia is simply a revelation and a pleasure to listen to . this recording is excellent .
1	i would not want to live in a world without the sound of this album . it ha been a while since i have heard this cd . i would be willing to spend a lot to own this cd .

0	this album is good ! i just can not seem to like it . i just do not like it . i just do not like it . i do not know what it is . i do not know how it is gon na be for me , but i just do not like it . i think it is probably because of the way that it is written . i think it is probably because of the way that it is structured . i think it is probably because of the type of music that is on it . i think it is probably because of the sound that is on it . i think it is probably because of the way that it is released . i think it is probably because of the way that it is been marketed . i just do not like it . i just do not . i just do not . i just do not . if i can not , then i do not . i just do not . i just do not like it . i just do not care for it . i just do not . i just do not like it !

0	i am an unabashed fan of the beatles . i always enjoy listening to their music and always find something new to enjoy . i wa excited to get this album because i had been hearing the new beatles in the news for the past few month . i never thought i would be able to hear the beatles in their first live performance in 50 year , but i can now . this performance wa really good . paul mccartney wa the only one who sounded remotely like himself . he wa not a good singer , but he wasnt bad . i wa very impressed with the other member of the band , and it wa amazing to hear john , paul , george , and ringo together on stage together . this is a great live performance . i am really glad i listened to the album before i listened to the live version . it wa a great way to see them in concert before they stopped touring . i have not listened to this album since i had the chance to get it , but i know it ha been sitting in my amazon cloud collection for the past year , and a soon a i get an opportunity to hear it , i will make sure to post a review . i hope everyone will enjoy this album a much a i have .
0	this is a really good album , i love the way they mix everything up at once , the way they played the guitar and the bass and all the stuff , the way they do the vocal is so smooth and easy to listen to , i love the way they mix the song . so i just bought this album for the vocal and the song .
0	i can not say i like this album much . the music is amazing , but i do not like the lyric .
0	i never thought that i would be a fan of this group . i guess i am an old music snob who doe not care much for the pop scene . still , this is a good album .
0	i have listened to this song a couple of time now and i just do not like it . it is really repetitive and boring .
0	i think this wa free . maybe i did not pay for it . i do not know .
1	this is one of the best blue collection ever . robert johnson is to blame for much of the blue style that ha been developing ever since .
0	this is one of my favorite song . i just wish they would have stuck with the original version .
0	i am still waiting on the second cd , and i can not wait to hear it .

1	i can not believe that i am the only person that think this cd is too short . i think it is really great ! i have a lot of cd and i love them all but this one is really short and i like it that it is really short .
0	lyric and music are lame . the vocal are lame .
0	i really bought this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise . this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , because it is a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on those word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the rest of the song , i have shared the one song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister meeting , i have shared the other song and listen to them a well , i have shared the other song and listen to them a well .
1	i wa pleasantly surprised to find this album when i wa in london , england in early june of 1997. i just happened to see the cd in a record store in london , england ( kingston music ) and decided to pick it up , and i have been playing this cd ever since , and i love it ! the guitar playing is very good , and the song are all very good . it is a good cd to learn and to play .
1	this is a great listen . i have heard of this band , but i have never listened to them before . they are great . it is really nice to hear a diverse group of musician that are not all the same . this album is a great listen .
0	the eagle are back ! after a few year of silence , the eagle are back with a new album i have to admit i wasnt too thrilled with this album . i wa not even aware that they had a new album , so i guess i wa really looking forward to it . however , this album is not one of their best , it ha not really changed much from their older style . the first three song are all about the same a the song on hotel california you belong to me , and take it to the limit . when i first heard rockin in the free world , i thought it wa an awful song . i listened to it a few time and realized it wa one of the best track on the album , but it still did not thrill me . i will follow is another good song . the last two song are also good , do not trust your heart is a slow song , and take it to the limit is a fast song . the album is a little too slow for me , but it is not a bad album . it is just not my favorite . the album is also not that good . i have listened to their older album so i knew what to expect from this album . i wa expecting to hear more of the eagle sound , but this album doe not really have much of a sound to it . i would give this album a 1 star review . i would have given it a 5 star review if the song on the album were a good a the first three . the only reason i even gave it a 1 star is because it wa the only album i bought , but i am not sure why i bought it . i wish they would just release the album on cd , it would be much easier to buy . i will not be buying the album for a long time , but i will still listen to them . this album is definitely worth the $ 7 i paid for it .
1	i wa searching for western swing but this is the only one i found that i liked .
0	this song ha a really good guitar riff but the vocal are so horrible it is not worth listening to .
0	it is a bit cheesy but not bad . a bit too long but the song is good . i wa bored so i listened to it . i am not going to buy it .

1	i love it . it is a classic . a total musical masterpiece .

1	i love this album . it is so-so . there is nothing here that stand out from the rest . the band sound ok , which is about what you expect from them . i do not know why they have not released more album . i have been listening to these guy for a long time . i have this album and i really like it . it is not good , but it is not bad either . the vocalist a bit high pitched and it is just a little off . i do not know . i am not sure it is their best album . i do not know . i am not sure . i think i am going to give this album one more go before i stop listening to it . i have listened to it a few time , and i really like it . it is one of my favorite to listen to .

1	an exceptional album . the album is excellent and the singing is great . they are a great group .
0	if you are the person who is going to read this article , i have to say , i do not like how this album is recorded at all . it is just all too generic , and like the lyric are made by a 14 year old that doe not know how to write lyric . it is really disappointing . i give it 5 star because the song are really good and i like the idea of the album . however , i do not think it will get much airplay . i suppose you can enjoy it on your computer , but i do not recommend it . i guess he is just trying to make up for ai 2006/7 . i do like the fact that he is making a new album , but it is sad that this album is just so generic . they should at least try to write a new song for thalia voice .

1	the cd is a collection of song written by charles lloyd , paul mccartney , and bernie taupin . the album is more of an anthology of musical style than a single cohesive album . however , the song do have some common point a to the type of melody , rhythm and instrumentation used . the album is a beautiful , relaxing and enjoyable listen . some song are a bit le enjoyable , for example , the chorus to the ocean in the garden and the beginning of the last time . however , overall , the cd is a beautiful and enjoyable addition to any collection .

0	this one wa a little disappointing . the boy are talented musician . they can sing in a variety of style , the singing is easy to follow and they did a nice job of incorporating a variety of instrument to produce a cohesive , enjoyable and well written album . did they have an interesting sound with the instrument ? i did not hear it but i would guess that it wa a good one .

0	this is not an album you can get excited about . you can make an album like this and get someone to love it , no problem . but to me , a masterpiece is not just an album that everyone love . a masterpiece is a masterpiece . and like i have said before , the liner note are not enough to explain the greatness of an album . i do not care about the liner note to most album . the liner note for this album are a joke . i am sorry , but i wa hoping for something more from this album . but they left me completely cold . i wa disappointed .

0	this is an excellent musical based on the film , but the score is not quite a good a the film . i wa disappointed though , but this is just not a good enough album to justify the original cost of the broadway version . while the song are good , the musical is very over-produced and the score is not a good a the film . the original musical is fantastic .

0	this is the only song to come out in black and white , so the only thing i can tell you is that i do not like this song .

0	this song ha been playing over the loudspeaker for the past several year , especially during our road trip from the bay area to our home in the mountain of central pennsylvania or the bay area to the home in the mountain of central pennsylvania . i still can not believe how old this song is . it is like the song is from the 1970s or something . i have always loved this song and i do not know why i did not buy the cd before . it wa worth every penny . the only thing that i did not like about it wa the cd wa damaged in the mail and when i received it i wa unable to play it . i do not know if you can send a bad cd to amazon.com , but i have the cd in a different folder . i did a lot of online shopping and i always use the best shipping method for my order and i always know the price of the order so that i can make sure i am getting the best deal . i use amazon.com because i have used them for year and i love their service and quality . if you have a better amazon.com review than mine , i am sure it is because i have saved you all the trouble of buying this cd and not using the service . i bought this cd on ebay for about $ 2.99 because i have a good record collection and i wanted to save this cd for a special reason .

1	the song is so catchy , my cousin just started dancing to it . i always thought it wa so cute . she really like this song . this song is so good . i love it !
0	the first of several cd that i have purchased from amazon . i have been searching around for great choral music for my church . this cd wa definitely what i wa looking for . i highly recommend this cd .
0	this is the best oldie collection i have ever heard . this is just a great tribute to the past and a great collection of song . the cover art , the liner note , the music , the sound quality , the feel , the presentation , and the overall experience of listening to this album is just perfect .
1	i have been listening to this song for the past few day . after a few listens , i wa hooked . this is the best song of the bunch for me .
1	this song ha a great beat and sound but the lyric are garbage .
0	i wish i had this cd sooner . i wa in the middle of an exhausting and stressful job but i just had to get away . i wa at a christmas concert and i did not have any time to get off the phone . i wa trying to get some rest from my stressful job but i had to get out of the house . when i heard the song i wa very emotional and i started to cry . i wa so happy to be able to listen to this song . i recommend this cd to anyone who need to get away from a stressful environment and need to get away from a noisy environment .
0	the title say it all . it is a bad cd for the most part . the song are good , the album is good , the packaging is good , and the cover art is awesome . i am a little disappointed that they are not going to give it away for free . also , tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song by the group . i will wait for the next album to get it .
1	i have listened to this album several time . i am really enjoying it . i love it , love it , love it . i have given it to my son , and i am glad that i did . i think it is excellent . i have not had a chance to listen to it in a couple of week , but i will listen again .

1	the best rap album of the year by far , easily . the beat are really good , and the rhyme are very good . i would not have been disappointed with this album if i wa just going to listen to rap on it merit .
0	i have listened to this cd a few time . i think robert johnson wa a great bluesman . he wa a great singer . his voice wa powerful and he could really sing , and i really like the way he sang . i have never heard him sing live . if you hear the same thing i do about a song you like , then i really like that song . i like a lot of the early blue . i do not like some of the later stuff . i have heard that he had a lot of different style of music . i think he did a lot of jazz song and also some of the early blue song . i think he did a lot of music that wa more along the line of what i like . i think he had a lot of personality . i think he wa a real person . if you like a lot of the early blue , i would definitely recommend this cd . i think it is a good cd for anyone to listen to . i would recommend it for everyone . i definitely think you will like it . and i definitely recommend it for anyone .
1	very enjoyable . the song are catchy and the performance are just great .
0	eminem is the most amazing singer/songwriter . it is hard for me to write a negative review because his music ha always been good . it just the way he writes his song . some of his song can not be written that way , and he sometimes ha to use weird rhyme to make them flow a little better . but he is good at it and he make me smile .
1	one of the best song on this album . the chorus is my favorite part of the song . the production is great . the flow of the song is good , the beat is good , the flow of the lyric is good and my favorite line is : you are my best friend , i do not want to lose you . do not ever leave me like this . the verse are good but the chorus make the song .
1	i can not believe i did not already mention this earlier . the second single off this great album is called you & me and i think it is a great song .
1	i just started listening to schubert and what a great pleasure it ha been . i have listened to this cd over and over , and i just fell in love with the music . i bought it because i love schubert and i also wanted to own a schubert cd to add to my collection .
1	this is a great way to enjoy a song without listening to the entire cd .
1	this album is the real deal . this is my favorite album from this artist . i bought my first cd from him and found that he ha a large fan base that are loyal and very appreciative .

1	i enjoyed this cd . i am a fan of the wonderful song of south pacific . i bought this cd because it wa on sale & i wanted the entire show to listen to . i enjoyed it very much & i will most definitely buy the cd . however , i have to say that the album doe not contain everything i would have wanted on the cd . the show contains a lot of new song that i would prefer to be heard on stage . also , when i first listened to the album , the new song seemed a little too familiar to me . however , after listening to the entire album , i realized that they are all wonderful . i would have given this cd to a friend if i could .
1	i love this album . i listened to this album for the past 5 year . it is my favorite album . it is one of the best album that the latin genre had produced . it is a little more commercial but still very good . the song are extremely catchy and the lyric are very personal .
0	i do not really listen to rap , but this is pretty good . they have a good flow and they can make a song pretty fast . the one song i do not like is the song i do not give a damn because the lyric are not very original . the lyric about being a little messed up but still strong and strong enough to do what they need to do . i guess that is a good motto for them to live by . the song fool is another fast song with a good flow . i do not like rap song with a lot of word , but this is one . i do not know who wrote the lyric , but it is not one i would change . the beat is also something i do not think i would change .

1	this is the best thing i have heard in a long time . i am so glad i purchased it .
0	this is wonderful . i love jewel . the song and the story she tell in them are just amazing .
1	this song start off like a classic r. kelly song , with the heavy guitar riff and the catchy chorus . it is easy to get into the song and to get the last word out on your mic .
0	i wa really disappointed with the price on this album from amazon . it cost $ 19.99 and wasnt listed a a 99 cent album . but , it wa really worth it . the album wa worth it is price . i have bought several album from amazon and this is the second album that i have bought . i have heard that this album ha a lot of new music . it is really fun .
0	this song is in my amazon cloud collection , but i do not like it . i may download it for my personal use , but i think i will not purchase it .

1	i feel that i would not be able to sing in front of people and would not want to sing at work .
0	i do not like this song . the only thing i can think of is that the singer is trying to be a tough guy . he is not being very positive in his song . it is just hard to like this song . it is just too boring for me . it is just too generic . i do not know why he is singing , but i guess it is about life , i guess it is like an average man love life . it just sound like he is singing about himself , and i just do not care for it .
0	i did not like the song , but it wa well sung .
0	this wa a great opera .
0	i like the song on this album . some are a little better than others , but i like the overall sound of the album . it is a good album , but not that great , but it is not bad .
0	a very disappointing album .
1	the song is very beautiful and it fit the movie anchorman : the legend of ron burgundy , very well !
0	this is a good album for a couple of reason : 1 ) it is not a bad album . 2 ) the cover art is cute and interesting . 3 ) the song is good . 4 ) the song are good . 5 ) the album is good . 6 ) the price is good . 7 ) the length of the song is good . 8 ) the music video is a good clip . the only thing that really annoyed me is the fact that the song are all titled the same . each track is entitled i do not wan na know or i do not wan na know or i do not wana know and the song themselves are pretty much the same . if i would have noticed this before buying this album , i would have not bought it and i would have been the winner .

1	i love this band !
0	i have a hard time describing this cd . it is a very enjoyable album to listen to . the music is beautiful and the vocal are very good . when i listened to the entire disc , i wondered how i could purchase two disc . i wa very happy to find that i could purchase two cd with this set . i am a big fan of the opera turandot and this cd contains a good amount of it . i hope that i can get the entire opera when i start to learn it .
1	this group is awesome ! they sing so beautiful . i would buy this album over and over . the sound quality is good . they are so cute .
0	i like the cd . i have only listened to it once . but i am a big fan of the blue . i listened to it again tonight . the guitar player ha a nice tone . the band is tight . i really like the cover and the packaging . i do not know what i would do if i lost my cd . but i would not be too upset . it is a cd , not a cd . i like it , but i think i will stick with my old collection .
1	i am not a schubert fan , but this cd ha a number of song from his repertoire . it is a great collection and a bargain for the price . it is my first purchase of a collection of schubert song .
1	this is a really good album ! it ha a lot of different style of music . the voice is very appealing and the lyric are very well written . i wa surprised at how many song on this album have a positive message . this album is worth it and i will be purchasing it again !
0	i have listened to this album several time . i like the music , but i would not recommend this album to anyone . the song in this album is not the same a the original , and i would not recommend this album to anyone .
0	i got this a a christmas present . i had not heard any of the song before i bought it , and i wa a little surprised . i have heard the cd and it sound like it is from the sixty . i got the deluxe cd , but not the regular cd . the regular cd doe have a few song i did not love . the band is great . i still love it when they play . not a bad cd for the price , but the whole thing is a little disappointing .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	i have been a fan of reverb since i began buying vinyl in 96 . this album is the first time i have been able to listen to it . i like it a lot . the song are a little slower and mellower sounding than all of their others . i do not think they are a good a they used to be . i like the song that stand out . i do not know how the band ha stayed together for so long .
1	this is another fun album .
1	the only song that i like is twiztid . the rest of the album is boring .
1	this is an amazing cover . it really brings to life the feel of the song .
0	this is easily the best cd i have ever listened to . the liner note are great . the music is great . the only thing i do not like about this album is that lin manuel miranda is not the best singer/musician . i give it a 3 star rating .

0	jewel is not the jewel i knew . now she is in a horrible relationship , and ha written many mediocre song . i have to be honest , in some way her voice ha come back , but her singing is not a strong a it wa . i have not heard one song that i would describe a jewel . i have been listening to jewel for many year and always thought she wa an amazing vocalist . she is an amazing artist . i have to admit , i wa a little disappointed with the cd , but i wa also expecting to have the jewel i always remembered . the vocal are very weak and the lyric are boring . i hope she can find someone who will write good song for her . i think she should just stick to singing and not try to sing song with her singing voice . i am not really a jewel fan , but i am a fan of good music . i will stick with the cd until the cd is over . the music is very weak and boring . i do not have many jewel song . i enjoy the song heaven and i will always love you . i will buy the cd until it is over . jewel is a great singer , but i do not think she is the jewel i know .
1	i like the fact that the music is nice and relaxing .
1	it is a very good cd .
1	this album is an excellent collection of song . the album start off slow but pick up with the last song gut over fear . i wa surprised at how much this album reminded me of the lose yourself album . the album doe not go into any deep analysis of drug , society , etc . it just focus on how eminem is truly not the same person anymore . the music is very good - very good ! i highly recommend this album to anyone that like eminem .
0	i am a big fan of robert kelly and his the blue series . i love listening to his song and i have bought many of his album . i wa very excited to see that he had chosen this particular song . you can not go wrong with this song . bob voice is beautiful . this is one of my favorite song .
0	this song seems to be just like any other song with 4 chord . it is got a great melody , but you need to take a lot of thing into consideration before listening to this song . first , take into consideration the song length . this song is way too long for your average listener to enjoy . secondly , you need to consider the song tempo . this song slows down at the end . lastly , you have to consider the melody . the melody in this song is very upbeat , and it ha a very catchy hook . that is it , that is all i can think of . i never realized that i just loved you is the same song a i just loved you ( until i knew you wa mine ) until i wrote this review . i will not buy this song .
1	the sound quality is good , the lyric are a bit hard to understand , but the music is good . i do not listen to a lot of music , but this one is good and i think she should release more album . i appreciate her singing , but i am not a fan and i would rather listen to other stuff .
1	i am a big fan of this singer . i really like her song . i think it is very nice . it is very positive and it is very nice . i think the only problem with this album is that it is a little too long . i like the song he is too good to me . i think it is a very nice song . i hope this album is great .
1	this song will forever be one of my favorite song . it ha a great sound and i love the lyric .
0	not a great album , but i did not expect much from it .
1	this is a really well written and produced cd . i love this cd . i wanted to like it . i hoped to like it . i wa disappointed to find out it wasnt for me . i do not know what i expect from a meghan trainor album , but i do not expect this . maybe i am being a little unfair . to me this is a great cd .
0	i do not really like this album . it is not a bad album , but i do not like it .
0	this album ha been a lot of fun for me . it is kind of a hard album to not love , but it is not a beatles album .
1	i wa searching for a song that i could listen to while driving or riding my bike . i have listened to it on the bike a few time . i love it . i still listen to it . i love it .
0	i am always surprised by the quality of bob dylan recording . the first one i purchased wa the 1965 desire album . i liked the song that dylan had written , but i did not like the singing of him . i do not know if dylan knew that he wa not a great singer , but i think he should have known . i wa very impressed with the quality of this album . this is the only dylan album that i have listened to , since it wa released . i am sure i will buy more of his album , but i probably will not buy this one .
0	i think this is a great concept , but it is not the same a the real thing . the only reason i gave it a 5 is because of the great song , the instrument , and the overall vibe . i would have rated 4 if it wa like the real thing .
0	the album is very good . you have to listen to the song , but at the end you will know what you are listening to . it is a very good album . you have to buy it .

1	this song is truly beautiful .
1	this is very good . i love it . i will play this song a lot .
0	the first single off the upcoming album , we do not need dembows is such a great song , and is the first song of the album i have heard . i love the way she sings , and i like the fact that she is not afraid to make fun of herself in a song . i think that is one of the thing that made my album more enjoyable than trainors previous album .
1	i have been looking for a new group to add to my cd collection . i am glad i finally found this one . i have heard some of the song but have not listened to the whole cd . i have a couple of the song but i think i will skip most of them , a i really do not like them . the best song on the cd is the one with the chorus . i like the song , but i do not like the band . i think this cd is good . i will put it on my list of cd to buy .
0	it is a great album . i really enjoy the production and the song .
0	the cd is great . you can hear it in your car !
1	this song is one of my favorite of 2010. i really like the song and i love the meaning of the song . i think it is great to play whenever you want to feel happy and have a good mood . it is a great song to play on a rainy day or at the end of a long day , it is a great song to play when you are feeling down .
1	this will make you want to listen to country music .
1	this song mean a lot to me , a it represents my life for the past 11 year .
0	the second album released from the new label , m-phazes , the illlusion , is one of the worst hip-hop album ever made . in my opinion , this is one of the worst album released in the 21st century . this album is just a big fat mess . the worst part about it is the fact that the producer have no clue what they are doing , and that is what really kill this album , the lack of production skill . the album ha a very good flow , the song seem to flow , but the album run all the way through and end up being a total mess . the lyric are all over the place , they are very repetitive and have no flow . this album is just a mess . the album is just a big fat mess . the worst part about it , is the fact that the producer have no clue what they are doing , and that is what really kill this album , the lack of production skill , the album is just a big fat mess . the album is just a big fat mess .
0	not a great song . the song wa good when it wa on the cd , but on the digital version , it is just not there .
0	the only good song on thalia is aqui ya no quiero , but i can not stand the rest of the album . it is not a bad album , but it is not a great album either .

1	i like the song , it is the same song that came on my ipod which is a little loud but i do not mind the song , it is not really a bad song either .
0	this song is a perfect example of how the songwriter are able to take a good song and turn it into something that is mediocre .
1	this is the best of danzig album . so many great song .
0	i bought this song by mistake . i would never buy a clean version of an eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for .
0	this album is great . it is really good .
0	i love this album , but i can not get into it . i love the song , but i just can not find the right word to say about it . this is just a great album . but there is a problem i have . i think it is the lyric . the lyric are great , but i just can not get into the song . i love the song but i just can not get into the lyric . i think it is because i am just not a fan of meghan trainor . she is amazing and i love her music , but my husband dad and i are not big fan of her music . we are not big fan of her rapping . i also do not listen to rap music very often . i just can not get into this track . i just can not get into her music . i can not say anything bad about her music just because i am not a fan .
0	i have a few friend that are big twiztid fan and i play this album for them . i just got an autographed copy of the album and it is incredible . i know i am not the only one that enjoys the music of twiztid . i love the melody and the beat . this album is worth the money .

1	this is a beautiful collection of music . it is well recorded . the singer are great and the music is wonderful . i would like to hear more of these people .
0	this collection ha good song , but they have been put together in a way that doe not appeal to me .
0	i have a cd of this artist named john besh . i enjoy his album , but i am looking for something else . this artist ha a lot of great song on his album , but i just can not get into his new album . i have heard many song on his album and i like them all , but i just do not get into the new song . i would rather listen to a great cd full of great music than listen to another great cd with mediocre song on it .
0	this album ha a very good beat , but i just can not seem to relate to the lyric .
0	this album is just ok. i like their first two album , but i do not think this is one of their better album .
0	i listened to this album before i went on a job interview . before i even got the chance to hear the song , i already knew i did not like it .
0	i have never felt this way about a record before . this album left me feeling like i wa in a horrible relationship . i could not listen to any more .
1	this song is a classic . it is the epitome of pop rock in it is day . the guitar is very powerful and the entire song is very catchy . the song is very popular , but i do not think it is overplayed .
1	this is my first cd from this company . i am just a christian woman , but i wanted to find song that would help me be a better person . this is a great cd . i have listened to it several time .
0	my favorite of the entire soundtrack . loved the bass intro , the guitar work , and the vocal .
1	great album . it ha a very positive message and a great message with it .
0	not a fan , unless you are into r. kelly . i prefer the vinyl version , and i like to have my music on vinyl , but i do not love the vinyl version .
0	i think this album is a joke . there are just too many skit , too many character , too many rap song , and a whole lot of annoying music from the back . the only thing that i really liked about this song is the chorus and the beat , but i guess the rest of the song is just too repetitive and boring . i am done with twiztid and i am done buying their music .
0	this music is great ! i love it . i will buy this cd for sure . it wa great .
1	i like the choir on this cd .
0	this song ha a good melody and a good chorus . it is the song for you if you love ballad and you want to sing along with the beat .
0	the r. kelly album is the best !
0	this is a great song . it is a great song and a great song that ha been played to death .
1	this is the second single off of the album the blackest of the black ( which should have been released after the album wa done ) .
0	i listened to this cd last night , and i must say that i am glad that i am not a good a meghan trainor , because i am not good enough to enjoy this music . this music doe not appeal to me . i really do not like it . i do not know why i am reviewing this . i just do not like it . i listened to it twice and i can not believe that i actually bought this cd . it is like , well , i guess i am reviewing it to be a downer . i do not know why i am reviewing it . i think it is a waste of money . i do not even know if i will listen to it in the future . is it worth the money ? i do not know . i do not even know why i am reviewing it . it is not good , it is not even good . this is really hard to believe . i do not know why i am reviewing it . i have to say that i really do not even like it . i have not even bought it , i just wrote this review . i have to say that i do not even like it . i have to say that i am not really a fan of meghan trainor . i just do not like it . i do not even like the song that i just wrote . i do not even like it .
0	it is music to have in the car , the office and on a run .
0	i had to check out this disc because i want to see what a schubert song sounded like . i listen to a lot of schubert ; especially his piano music . this disc did not sound like anything i have ever heard before . very interesting and i wish i could find a cd of this artist before i die .
1	this is the most enjoyable version of the song that i have ever heard .
0	i am a big fan of this band and the song were pretty good . the only problem with the album is it is too long . i would not buy it if i were you .
0	the album ha good song on it but it will not be the same a in the air . i think this album is going to be a great album . it is a very good album . but this album will not be the same a their previous album . i can not think of any other way to describe an album which ha great song and nothing really special . i am sure this album will have great song on it but i am not too excited about it .
1	this song make me feel happy . and it a great song .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	i wa really looking forward to this cd . i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but it is still good , but it did not quite come through for me . it just did not stick with me a a whole . i will probably listen to it again , but i will not buy it .
0	this is a great album . it ha a lot of energy , good song writing and musicianship . it is a good album .
1	i like the music in this song .
1	there is a lot of good stuff on here . i like to listen to music to get lost in the process .
1	this cd is great and i love it . i bought it because i wanted to hear christian praise but i did not know where to find it . this cd ha given me so much more . i listen to this with my family and we all have our own favorite christian song . i love the sound of it and i know that the lord make use of these musician to glorify him .
1	this is a great album . i love the cd because it ha so many great song . i love that the cd doe not end with a song you have heard all your life . the last song is a bit of an amen but i love that last song . i love that the cd ha a few christian song like worthy lord , the way god spoke , i believe in joy and the worshiping of the lord .
0	this album by hall and oat is a really good album . the band is not dependent on the blue and folk , but the music is very good .
1	this is a great cd of excellent classical music . i am one of those people who do not listen to classical music all the time , but when i do , i want the best . i purchased it because it contains music i have not heard before , and is of the highest quality . i am happy i bought it .
0	( i like this song ) this album is pretty good . it is a good mix of pop/rock .
0	this song wa alright . it had a good beat , but some part were a bit annoying .
0	i have heard about this album a lot , and i wa really looking forward to checking out a new cd by meghan trainor , but unfortunately , i really did not like this album at all . i still like the song the beginning , but this album really disappointed me . i really did not like any of the song . i hope people like the music that they have heard so far , but i really wish that meghan trainors new album that she is working on doe not come out for a while .
0	this album ha a very good start , with a catchy song called girlfriend , and an album ending song called girlfriend is one of my favorite of the year . while i do enjoy the album overall , i feel that this album is very much like the last two album i have listened . i feel like it is not a progressive , and i am not sure exactly what i am supposed to feel about it . there is an upbeat song with a high note that sound just like an electric guitar , which is very un-mumford-like , but there is also some song that have a very slow tempo , and a few song that have an almost-frauded-out sound . i do love the song , but i am not sure what i think about this album .
1	i really enjoyed the cd . i would have to say that this cd is one of my favorite . the arrangement of the song and the singing of the lady wa wonderful . i just love the music of this cd and i would have to say that this cd is my all time favorite .
1	this song is great , but i am in love with the second line : and i wa a fool for being such a i .
0	the music is very good .
0	not a bad album , but i am not really in the mood for it . i am waiting for it to be re-released .
0	a really really bad album ! it is a lot of noise and annoying and not a lot of good song . it is not a very good album !
0	i really like this band . but i have to say i am not a fan of traditional christmas music . i am a die-hard fan of the oldies/classic rock/oldies/classic rock music . i think some of the music is very well done ( like them on the cd and the spirit of christmas on the dvd ) . however , i think a lot of the christmas music is just meh ( in term of quality ) . i know this is just my opinion , but i just do not get it . i do not understand what they are trying to convey . i just do not like it . but i do like the cd and dvd . their cd is just all of the best song they can play . the dvd is a little more generic , but still good ( just not my style ) .
0	this is a cool song .
0	
1	this album ha some of the best guitar playing i have heard in a long time . great musicianship and great playing .

1	this is a great cd . it is a great way to learn . i have been studying for year , but have always been concerned about singing in front of people . i definitely have learned a lot from this cd . i can not wait to take lesson with cyney davis . i am looking forward to learning from her .
1	i have been listening to this album for year . i think it is the best cd i have ever had in my collection . the only thing that would improve it would be a little more instrumentation .
0	i love this song . it reminds me of the halloween song by the beatles . i like a lot of the song that he ha done . it is very repetitive , but i am getting used to it . i have heard this song many time , and i love it .
0	this album did not really do much for me .

0	a must have for lover of the soprano . great song that go into the character of the show .
1	i love robert johnson . i used to listen to him when i wa younger . i had him on my cd player and i would listen to all his song . now that i am older , i listen to more blue artist like sam cooke , lightnin hopkins , sam and dave , robert johnson , and of course the king himself .
0	i can not stand this song .
0	i thought it wa going to be a really good song by a young artist , but it seemed to be written and performed by an older , much more famous artist ( who wasnt in the group , and the recording wa done by a very successful artist ) . this is very disappointing . i would have enjoyed listening to this song .
0	this is a very good recording . the piano is clear and sound like it wa recorded by a professional with good equipment . the recording is very clear . i do not know anything bad or good about this recording .
1	i am a huge fan of smooth jazz . i love all of the song on the album and have listened to it over and over again .
1	i purchased this cd primarily to help me discover an instrument i have wanted to play for a very long time . this cd contains one of my all time favorite song , i will be there for you and when i fall in love . i found it quite difficult to sing a song with complete lyric , so i decided to listen to the song with the music playing and put the lyric to the song on my own . i found that the song came to life when i listened to it with the lyric on , and i really enjoy singing this song . i found the performance more meaningful when i did not have the lyric , and i wa able to feel the song come to life .
0	this is a good album . the first cd ha some great moment that i loved . the second cd ha a lot of really good song . i think this is a good album . not for everyone , but if you like this genre of music , you will probably enjoy it .
1	i have not seen them in a while , so i would love to see them again .
0	i have a bit of a problem with people saying how this is bad . i just do not see it that way .
1	: this is a great album , it is not amazing , but it is good

1	quien canta de thalia ? thalia e una mujer desagradable y con una boca de loca . parece que se está rompiendo el brazo para cantar . la canción e una canción en vivo pero no se puede ver la boca de thalia . thalia e una mujercita en la televisión y radio latino . la cancion e una canción en vivo pero no se pueden ver la boca de thalia .
0	i have been a fan of biggie small for a number of year and this album is a joy to hear . the beat are dope and the music is fun to listen to . i wish that they would have gone with their own beat , but it is still a fun listen . a for the lyric , just take a listen to the chorus to you keep me hanging on and tell me how bad they are .
0	i like this song . it is a bit slow and ha a lot going on in the music . it is a little difficult at time to keep your attention .

0	i have listened to this cd a few time and i really like it . i would say that this is a good cd . i would recommend it to a friend .
0	i wa really disappointed with this album . i am not sure everyone who purchased this cd would be . the sound wa just not the same a the previous two album . while there are a few decent song , there are way to many filler track . in other word , this cd is boring . it is not a waste of your time , but it is a waste of money . i believe that this is a bad cd , but it is nothing compared to what you will find on the other two cd . if you hate latin music , this is not for you . if you love latin music , or if you love this type of music , then this is a good cd . however , if you are looking for a good cd that is not boring , this is not it . if you are looking for a cd that is not boring , then get this cd . it is not the worst cd ever . if you need a cd that is not boring , get this cd .
0	this cd is very bad . i will not bother to listen to it . this cd is very bad . i will not bother to listen to it , cause i think it is a waste of time . this cd is a waste . this cd is bad . this cd is a waste . this cd is a waste of time . this cd is a waste of time . this cd is a waste of time . this cd is a bad cd . this cd is a bad cd . this cd is a bad cd and it is a good cd . this cd is a good cd .
1	i had to skip this one because i bought it without really knowing what i wa getting into . the album wa very good , but i have to say that the cd itself is very very nice . i know for a fact that i need to buy the deluxe version to be able to get the extra track . the song are very good . i will have to listen to the other song when i get the chance to listen . for the most part i really like the song . i can not say that i am a big fan of madrox and i know that i am not . the song are very good , and i like to listen to hip hop music , and the music on this song is very hip hop . i can not say that i like madrox much , but i do like the song . the song is very nice and i would recommend this cd to anyone who like hip hop and rap music . if you do not like hip hop or rap music then you probably will not enjoy this album . i would recommend this to anyone who like hip hop music .

0	excellent cd . really like the song this i believe . i also really like the song i am a little bit of everything and the song a different kind of love . the rest of the cd is good , but i like the saxophone solo on a different kind of love . i have given it a 5. however , it is $ 12.99 and i have to say i would have paid $ 15 or $ 20 for it . $ 15 is a bargain . i can not believe i can not get the cd for $ 5 . but then , i can not believe that anyone would pay more than $ 5 to hear a cd .
1	this is a good album for someone who like to listen to a lot of instrumental music . this album is mainly instrumental . it ha good vocal , but not a good a other artist like david benoit .

0	i wa on the fence about this one , but i ended up giving this one 5 star . it is just the same generic ai , but i like the song and i do like the idea of the album . i think it would be good to make thalia sing one song , because it is really boring to hear her all the song . but , i do like the album . the only bad thing about this album is the fact that they have 5 song that i do not know and i do not really like . it just seems like ai last album . i think this album would get more airplay if ai sang one more song . i guess he is just trying to make up for ai 2006. i do like the idea of this album , but the song are just too generic .

0	i really dont know what to make of this album . i like it , but there are some song on it that i have never heard before , and some of the song on it have not been heard for a very long time , so i am not sure if they are good or bad . this album is the type of music that you would expect to hear in a old mall , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a city . this album is the type of music where you would expect a lot of noise , but you would never expect to hear it in a quiet mall . this album is the type of music that make you want to go walk around the mall with the light out , but you would never expect to hear it on a cold winter night . this album is the type of music that make you want to just sit and watch the sunset , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a sunny day . this album is the type of music that make you want to listen to the radio , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of an earthquake . this album is the type of music that make you want to talk to other people , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a fire . this album is the type of music that make you want to dance , but you would never expect to hear it on a dull day . this album is the type of music that make you want go to the movie , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of an invasion . this album is the type of music that make you want to play on a video game , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a war . this album is the type of music that make you want to jump on a trampoline , but you would never expect to hear it in the middle of a tornado .

1	jewel music is very powerful and the message is very clear . i know the time ha come for young woman to stand up and face the world , and be who they are . her message is a strong one and well-received . and for all you guy who hate her for being an over-sexed , over-weighted , over-macho woman , she is a true artist and i thank her for her music .

0	i love the way this band sound . when i heard them in 97 i thought they were pretty talented . i did not think they would make it out of the introversion that most people on this planet ( that i know ) have . they have been struggling to make it out of the introvert world for about 15 year , and i think it is time for them to get their act together .
1	this album ha no filler , every song is great and you should really buy this album .
1	this wa a great compilation .

1	the band originality and technical prowess are undeniable . they have a strong following and a devoted fan base , and they continue to release quality music . the song here are great , but sometimes they get a little repetitive . this album is great for people who are not much into radio ( or maybe are listening to the radio too much ) .
0	one of the best song on this cd .
0	this cd contains song from the late 1970s through to the end of the 1980s . the song are mostly good , but not the overall best .
1	great album .
0	well , the cover wa cute , and the cd ha some of the song on but the lyric were horrible . the lead vocalist wa not even singing and the song were nothing but reverb . the song themselves were great but when reading the lyric i kept thinking that someone wa screaming . there were song that i knew and loved , but i felt that it wa just not worth it . i really wish that bob johnson would have just said no to amazon and just put the song on his website .
1	the only reason i bought this wa to buy the cd to hear the first 5 song . i wa not disappointed . the song are great . i can not wait to hear the rest of them .

0	i heard the band back in the 80 and i loved them , but this just make me want to kill myself .
1	this album is great . i agree with the other reviewer that the repetitious nature of the song make it uninteresting to listen to while driving . however , the repetitious nature of the song is actually beneficial to me . the repetition , allows my mind to focus on the main theme of each song . this is a good album for the listener that like the repetition .

0	i just purchased this . i have heard it a few time , but i wa excited to hear it after listening to a few of the reviewer . i still like it , but it definitely need some more work . i do not even know why i bought it in the first place . it doe not have any review on it at all . i would not even buy it from this seller .
0	i have been searching for a good cd to buy for my wife . this cd is a keeper for me . i really like the music and the artist , i really do . it is a smooth jazz cd but you know what ? it a great cd .
0	i give this the 4/5 because i want to hear a lot more from them , but that is just my opinion .
0	i like it when the tempo change . i have some bad habit in my singing that i have been working on . i used to sing all the time , and i did not notice this until i got on a tour bus and wa singing the whole time . i have been singing for over 30 year and i wa so shocked at myself that i sang for a whole tour .
0	this is a really good cd , but the sound quality is really bad . not sure what it is , but i can not tell if it a cd or a mp3 .
1	this album really hit home . it really made me feel a lot better about myself . it really made me feel like i wa important and that i really did have a voice . it really made me feel like i had a power of some kind . i had to use that power to help others . it really helped me realize that i really do have a voice and that i need to use it .
0	i love this band , but i think it is a little different than i expected it to be . it is not so much the sound , but the lyric . i think it is a little better than others i have heard of , but still not a good a some of the more popular metal band i have heard . the lead singer , the keyboard , the guitar player and the bassist are great . i love the way they blend the genre together and make them interesting .
0	i am not a fan of this album . i bought it . it is the worst of the bunch . it is so boring . it is just repetitive and boring . i do not appreciate the fact that these guy do not create new song . they just repeat the same song over and over and over again . i am very disappointed in their new album . i will never buy another album or cd from them again . i am going to write a review on amazon . i will not buy another cd or record from them .

0	i downloaded the whole album and listened to the whole song . i do not like this song . i do not like the song . i do not like the lyric . i do not like the guitar .
0	i donned it because i thought it would be a nice bluegrass album . what i got wa a collection of song mostly done by a man who wa in a rock band with some other people . i have never heard of any of them , and i would have heard if they had been on the radio or not , but i really do not think this is the right album for me . just another folk album .

1	i heard this cd on the radio , and i wanted to have it for my collection . i have listened to it twice now , and i like it . the cd is more traditional than most cd i have heard . the song are very nice , and i do like the instrumentation . it is just a matter of whether or not you like what you hear . if you do like the cd , you will love the instrumentation . you will also love the vocal . i do not usually like the vocal i hear on regular radio , but i really like the vocal on this cd . i like the sound , but not the vocal . the vocal on this cd are much better than the one on the other cd i have listened to . the instrumentation is also better than usual . it is just a matter of if you like the cd or not . after listening to the cd two time , i am still undecided if i like it or not . i like the instrumentation , but the vocal are a little off . i would recommend this cd to anyone who love traditional music . it is worth the money to me .

1	i own this album , and i have to admit , i am a little disappointed . the music is good , but the sound production is lacking . the recording technique are ok , with a little bit of a tremolo in the sound , but it is not a problem . the sound is very good even when the band doe not play . overall , i would recommend this album to fan of the band but may not buy this one . i would buy a cd of the trout previous album , or of their own solo work .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense
0	love the tune , but i found it so annoying . the song ha to be turned up so high just to hear any word you can not hear . i bought this because it had the word happily in the first line that my husband and i like very much . it wa the only song in the store that night that had the word happily in the first line . the only other song on that cd wa you make me feel by the beatles . i bought this song because i thought they put the word happily in the right place . no , it is not in the right place . it is on the same side of the cd a you make me feel wa .

0	i have been a very big fan of the band ever since i had bought their first album . a an eminem fan , i wa really impressed with this album . i loved the first two album , but this one just did not do it for me . when they came out with this album , i thought it wa going to be awesome . i thought i would love it . i wa really hyped up for this album , but i wa disappointed . i think it ha a lot of potential , but i do not like the lyric on this album . i just can not listen to this album . i wish it would put out a clean version of the album so i would not have to listen to this terrible album .

0	dallas holms new album is awful . i have to admit , i wa one of those people who wa really looking forward to hearing this album . i am a huge fan of dallas holm and have been for a while . this album is not the best one he ha put out , but at the moment it is the worst one he ha put out . the track are generic and the lyric are not only generic but very stupid . the only thing that keep this album from being one of the worst in hip-hop is the song all i have got . the song doe have some good track on it , but is there really a reason to put this album out ?

1	i have not listened to the entire album a i had some other thing to listen to . what i have taken from this album is that twiztid is an old man and that he may not be the best singer at this point in time . i liked the album but it is time to move on to something newer . i will most likely purchase this album again . this is the only album that i have listened to other than the song on the video . i have listened to a couple of other song on mixtapes and youtube . i have not listened to the entire track on this album a all the track i have listened to have been the song from the video .

0	great album ! the only one i need to change is the hail to the chief by u2 . for some reason , i can not listen to this album for more than 2 or 3 day . it is just not worth the money to me !

1	my wife ha a cd of this group called love me . and it is the only cd i believe by them . the cd wa released in 1998. this cd is a step up from the one they released in 2001. however , while this cd contains some new song , it doe not live up to the cd that we received in 2001 .

1	meghan trainor is an amazing singer . her singing is amazing . i have heard a lot of music from her and i love it all . she is talented and i think she will continue to make great music .
1	ray benson , a gifted songwriter , creates the most beautiful christmas song .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song also , one of my sister who also ha a woman ministry called arise she will use this song a the theme song for her next woman conference . hallelujah ! may the lord blessing and peace , wisdom and knowledge continue to be poured into and upon these awesome men of god .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
1	hall and oat . need i say more .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	leave the light is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better becareful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
1	one of his best that is not often recorded .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	creepy a f # lyric and danzig voice . what is not to love ?
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	wow so worth it !
0	dudnt see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 2 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ?
0	came wutg cinoyter ,
1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !
0	meh
0	great band ! great song ! too bad this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd . the lesson challenge you and i know i sing better now . i recommend this for the beginner , the wannabe , and someone just wanting to sing better . maryelle b
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	shazamd this song off the good wife . it an empowering song !
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	good song
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	good song . good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
