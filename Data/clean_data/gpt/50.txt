0	i bought their cd from amazon.com . i love their music and i would love to have more of this band .
0	i would like to recommend this album a a better alternative to the other one .
0	this is probably one of the better album that i have heard in a long time and it show that they are going back to what they love . i am definitely glad that they are moving away from their hardcore root .
0	i wa expecting something a little different from this album when it wa released . but i am not really a fan of the band that made this album . i do like the cd cover and the cd booklet from the album . but i just can not get into the album . i do not want to be that guy that ha to listen to the whole album every time i want to hear a new song . i do not like this album , but i do enjoy listening to it . i have a lot of cd that i just can not get into . i am glad i bought this album . but i just can not get into it .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	i really liked this album , i really liked the sound of the guitar and the vocal . it wa everything i wanted .
0	i found this album really enjoyable , but the song where not a good a the first two . i thought this album had potential to become a hipster fad , but sadly it is not a good a the first two . i did enjoy the song that were on this album however , so it wa a good listen .
0	i thought that this song wa really good . their vocal are very nice .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	i have not heard any negative review on this album , but i have my doubt because it is just not my style . i like the lyric and the music , but it just is not my style . if i were to buy this cd , i would listen first to it , then i would put it on my ipod , then i would listen to it , then i would listen to it , then i would listen again to it , then i would listen to it , then i would not listen to it , then i would listen to it , then back to it , then back to it , then back to it and then off and on again . i love her song , but this is not one of them . i would recommend her cd to a friend , but not to a girl like me . i want to like the song on this cd . they are different and the music style is different and i like it , but i just do not like it . i would recommend listening to her cd first , then put it on your ipod , then listen to it on your ipod , then listen to it on your ipod , then listen to it on your ipod , then listen to it on an ipod , then listen to it on an ipod , then listen on ipod , then listen to it on ipod , then listen to it on ipod , and finally , listen to it on ipod .
0	i like it . i like the music . i like the lyric .
1	this is just a great album . i have listened to this album for 2 day now . i love it . i recommend this album to all .
1	the album wa really cool . the song were really good . the band wa really
0	i like this song , although this is a little out of place on my list . i do enjoy it though .
0	it is a good thing i went to the club with friend because my friend said i sounded like a whore singing at a wedding . i wa at the club with a group of friend and a guy who wa a friend of one of my friend ( not my friend ) came up to me and said , you sound like a whore singing at a wedding , you need to get out of here and get a job . i wa like , oh , man . this is bad . this is so bad . i can not believe what he said . he kept harassing me until i had to leave . i just took him to the back room where my friend and i ended up dancing . it is hard to believe that he is my friend . thanks for the memory .
1	the lyric are so powerful and inspiring . the message is spot on .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	i am not sure if i like this album . i really like the cover art and the song on the cd , however , some of the lyric are difficult to understand .
0	i did not really like this album . i wa a little disappointed with it because the song were not that great , and the production wasnt that great . i also thought that the song wa over the top . i did not really like the album . i did not feel like it wa very good . it wasnt the best album on the market , but that did not matter to me because i already had a lot of other music . i downloaded it so that i could hear the song without having to read the lyric , which is what i really did not like . i do not really like over the top cheesy sounding material .
0	this cd wa purchased through amazon program to give a free gift to a friend . there wa a typo on the order form . when i noticed the typo , i decided not to complete the order . the cd wa not the one i wanted . amazon gave me a message on my customer service page , that they would give me the cd that i had ordered , if i returned the other cd to them . i felt obligated to return the cd to amazon , because of the mistake . if i had not returned the cd , the cd would have been the cd that i had wanted . however , i returned the cd and got the cd that i wanted . i believe that the cd that i got from them , is better than the cd that i did not get . the cd wa purchased through amazon program . i would have gone to another store if i had not received the cd from amazon .
1	wow , what a great deal on this cd . this is a must have for all kind of music lover . i will be buying this cd and listening to it over and over again . great cd . thank you .

1	i bought this for my wife for christmas , and she loved it . it is a great collection of song about the female experience . i do not think there is anything that is been out for age that is a funny , a moving , or a entertaining a this . it is a great collection of song that are so well produced and thought out that it make me want to make the whole album of this kind of music ( i have ) into a cd . plus , this music is well written , and it just a lot of fun to listen to .
0	this album brings back memory of when i wa a kid and i loved this album . i listened to this album a lot when i wa a kid and i liked it then and i like it now .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	i just recently started listening to music from this band . it is so nice to hear music like this and have it come from a christian artist . i love the lyric and the music of this band .
1	a song from the movie the good wife ( and wa the first song i purchased for my daughter )
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	i have bought this album over and over again . my dad bought it while i wa in 8th grade and i have now bought it at least 3 time . every time i see it on the cd i get a thrill . it allways make me want to dance . the song i am a man is a nice song but the song shake it off is better .
1	first of all , if you are a fan of pop/rock i would recommend this . if you are a fan of r & b , country , jazz , blue and more i would recommend this . if you are a fan of hip-hop , edm and dance music i would recommend this . i love any type of music . i have to say , i like this cd . i think this is my most favorite cd that i have ever heard . i would say buy it when you can . there are a lot of cd that are not worth the money . i think this is a great cd .
0	a song where he talk about being in the same room with a woman .
0	this album wa the worst product he ha ever released . the album is only good because of the guest artist and the rapping skill of a true mc . if you want a great album , skip it .
1	the album is about the life and time of the infamous outlaw jesse james . there are three song on the album , all of them are excellent . i highly recommend this album to any fan of jesse james or any of his film music .
0	i think this song is pretty stupid . the chorus is catchy , but the rest of the song is just stupid . the lyric are nice , but the music is just plain boring . the chorus is very catchy , but the rest of the song is just plain boring .
0	i am glad that thalia sang this song . it is a very powerful song . i think that it is a very important song to sing in church . i am glad that they have done this cd .
0	i have always been a fan of eminem , but i thought this album wa just another of his mellow song . not the case . i liked the original album better . it wa more of a rock and roll album . i liked this album , but the music is very basic and i just did not like it . it is just a lot of song that are dull and boring and not very good . the original album is much better and i would have liked to hear it . the cover art is nice , but it is just the same old stuff that you would expect to hear . i would not recommend this album to anyone . just like the original album , it is just another nice album .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i really liked this album better than i expected i would like it , but i wa expecting to get the real jewel experience . i did not like any of the song that i have heard , and i did not like the song on the cd that i have heard .
0	i bought this cd for my husband and my son , it is the only cd that they listen to together . we both believe that we will remember this cd for many year to come . the song are very inspirational , they make you think , and the lyric are very interesting .
1	thalia , sister of bob dylan , is the only female artist i have ever met who sang in english . she ha a voice like her brother and she ha the same kind of strength .

1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	i have to say i am very disappointed in this album . the first song on the album just did not work at all for me . the second song just did not work with me . i felt that the song just sounded like the same old stuff , which is not what i expected from the album . the last song just wasnt for me . the song i wan na borrow your face is a song that is very mediocre at best . the album is good overall , but i do not think it wa worth the price of the album .

1	this is the best cd i have ever purchased . the cd ha so many different song that i just want to listen to every song . i have been looking for a cd that i could listen to every day and this is it .
1	if you are looking for a band to play in the car , these guy are perfect . they have a real groove to them , with a good beat . they are very energetic . they play a bunch of different style of music , including some soulful stuff . and they are pretty darn good .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	i donno who wrote this song , but it wa nothing to get excited about .
1	i like this album . it is an awesome album .
0	wow . this cd is everything i have come to expect from libera . the quality of the recording is very high , and the instrumentation is just right . the song are great , and have all the element that i love about folk-pop . a i listened to the album , i kept thinking to myself , what is not a good a this ? there are good song , like walking a long road , the song of the wind , and the way you smile , but most of the song are not a good a this cd . if you are looking for a new album to listen to , this is a good one . i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the genre of folk-pop .

1	this is a good album to get to know meghan trainor a little better . there are some good song here , but the song are not my cup of tea . i had to stop listening after the first three song . i did not like the song that i kept listening to . the song are not bad , just not my cup of tea .
1	m.i.a . is not just the woman of the moment , she is also the woman of the century . this album is simply amazing !
1	i received this cd in the mail today . the album is beautiful and i have been enjoying it alot . i think the sound quality is exceptional and they did a nice job on the album . i have heard good album that have sounded like a pile of garbage and this one come out looking much better . i would recommend this album to anybody who enjoys music . it ha a smooth , calming sound to it and a beautiful singing . i am sure you will not be dissapointed with this cd .

0	i like eminems new record , but i find it too repetitive .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
1	i hate this song . i have heard the sound of the guitar in the background . it is a nice , pleasant song .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	this is a very good song . the drumming is excellent , the bass and guitar are great , the vocal are great , the guitar are great , and the lyric are great ! i think i will end up buying this album !
0	i had never heard of this song before . i like this song . the song is very good and ha a great melody . i do not know why this song did not get any love . it is a very good song . but , it wasnt played a lot .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	i have noticed on a lot of cd that you can hear the artist vocal first and then it will hit you later when they play their instrument . that definitely happened with this cd . i really like the acoustic and electric song . i liked the music on this cd . i liked the background music on the cd . i like the variety of style that this cd had . i like listening to many different type of music . i also like the fact that this cd includes the power of love by john lennon . i also liked the cover of aquarius .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	he is a great emcee , but his music is so terrible . he is a generic emcee with nothing but generic rap . he is a generic emcee without any personality . he is boring and boring and boring . he just sound like a generic emcee . he sound like a generic emcee without personality .
0	i have yet to find anything on this album to dislike , but that may be because i have not found very many other album to compare to it .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	this song wa a little boring . they had a great voice and i liked the song a lot .
0	i bought it thinking it would be a great folk album . what i got wa a collection of song mostly done by a guy who wa in a rock band with some other people . i have never seen any of them . i have never heard of any of them , and i would have seen if they had been on the radio or not . i really do not think this is the right album for me . just more folk album .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	i like the song so much i have the song on my ipod and it keep playing in my car while i am driving .
1	great beatles song ! love the guitar playing and the lyric !
0	this is an excellent classical music cd . it had a great selection of music that i had to listen to .
0	good , but not that good .
0	the first song i ever learned to play wa when i wa four or five year old . i wa playing the piano and i wa just trying to get the a sound . my teacher , miss grace , said that i should not be playing this song because it is too difficult to play . my father wa a musician so he taught me to play this song . i never really liked it . when i wa about ten , i just started singing it , and by the time i wa twelve , i wa singing it all the time . i do not remember the first time i heard it . i think my dad took me to a concert or something , and they played it . i think i fell in love with it . i would love to have a record of the first time i heard this song . i believe that it wa a country song , but i do not remember what the name of the song wa . i just remember it wa a song that you sing and you go and live in a beautiful place , and you just go about your day . that wa the song that i sang . i do not remember how i learned to play it , i think i learned it by ear . i do not know . i know the song , but i do not know how i played it .
1	this is an excellent recording and the most complete recording available .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	i am not sure what to think of this cd . i have listened to it several time and i think that it is a good album , but i think that the lyric are hard to understand sometimes .

1	this album is so much better than i thought it would be .

1	this is the second album by mumford that i have heard . the first wa an album called mumford , which wa a great album . i did not like this album , however . this album contains song that are very repetitive and sound like they have been recorded by just one person . i do not think that this is the best album by mumford , because of the song that are repetitive . i would recommend this for people who like the alternative/rock genre .
0	this wa a very nice song , but i do not really understand it . it wasnt anything unique or memorable about it . i did not really like it , but it wa a good song .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .

0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	the song it is a long way to tipperary is a highlight on the cd . but the rest of the song are filler . the new cd ha more pop/rock/country style song . i wa hoping for more . i wanted to like this cd . i guess it is because of the cd cover . i wish it wa a new cd .

0	i purchased this album for the purpose of learning music history , but more importantly , for the purpose of discovering new music . i purchased this album because i am a big fan of the beatles , and so i decided to buy this album . i am not sure how the music industry ha changed so quickly , but i have to say , i am very disappointed . i tried to listen to the entire album , but i only listened to a few song . the vocal are very distorted and the song structure is very bad . for $ 14.99 , i expect better .
0	i love this song . it is my favorite . i think this song is a little more countryy than what i would classify a country . i like that . it just put a little something extra in to the song .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	i really enjoyed this album ! i liked the fact that she wa able to write a new song in the same time it took for her to write the last four . i also enjoyed the simplicity and the way schubert wa able to express his love for his wife . i have to say though , i do not think i could listen to this song with my wife . i find that it just make me sound like i wa thinking about her . i feel bad that i wa listening to this with her while she wa sleeping . i feel like i should have been listening to it anyway .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

0	i give album 5/5 because the song are amazing , the band is incredible , the vocal are amazing . the only thing i do not like about this album is that i can not get past the fact that they sound like they have recorded in a basement with an old tv .
1	the first time i heard this album wa on the radio when it wa on the shortwave radio . my dad heard it and told me to check it out . i had never heard anyone really sing like this before . i have always loved country music , but have only ever listened to the country genre . i have tried to learn more about country music , but i have always had trouble understanding it . this album changed all my perception on country music . although i think it ha a very traditional sound , it ha a twist that make it unique and interesting . it is a little dark at time , but i love it . i wish the band would play more live show and not so much of on the internet album . they are a great group and are having a great time playing music .

1	a great positive song .
0	if you are the person who is going to read this article , i have to say , i do not like how this album is recorded at all . it is just all too generic , and like the lyric are made by a 14 year old that doe not know how to write lyric . it is really disappointing . i give it 5 star because the song are really good and i like the idea of the album . however , i do not think it will get much airplay . i suppose you can enjoy it on your computer , but i do not recommend it . i guess he is just trying to make up for ai 2006/7 . i do like the fact that he is making a new album , but it is sad that this album is just so generic . they should at least try to write a new song for thalia voice .
1	the best song ever . i really like it . it is a very positive song . it make you feel like you are on a cloud . it make you feel like you are in heaven . a song that make you feel good about yourself . i love it .
0	it is okay . i like it just fine .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	i have never heard this artist before but i am glad i got this cd . i like it for christmas .
0	this is my third cd by this band .
1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

0	i am really disappointed in this cd . the singing is very choppy . the lyric are very general . i can understand the word they are singing , but it is hard to keep track of what they are saying . i am also disappointed that there is not a real choir in the background . the music is very nice , but the sound is distorted and it seems that the singer are having a hard time making out what they are saying . i think this cd would have been better if i had not purchased it . i would not buy it again . i would not recommend it to anyone .

1	after listening , i really liked this cd . i think that we all need to be exposed to great jazz artist . i wa surprised to find that this artist ha done a great job of recording some of the song . i bought it for my husband and my son . i listen to jazz on the radio and this is a great album that i am ready to buy .
0	i have only taken one lesson from cyney davis , and it wa with the boy on this album . i have a great singing voice , and love to sing . however , it is really hard for me to learn new song . this is the very reason i will not purchase this cd . the singing is very low on this album , and i have been singing this way for over ten year . this is not the way to sing for me . this is not good for me .

1	this album is amazing ! the band is very good and i love the song they sing . everyone ha different voice they can sing to , but i like how they sing the same exact word with different voice . i like the sound of the guitar on this album and it is very fun and exciting to listen to .

1	i love that this song is on this album . i do not know how i can put this , but i like most of the song on this album . i like the sound of this song . i do not know if that is true or not , but i do think that bob and his band have an incredible sound . i think this song is a good example of the sound that bob and his band are capable of creating . bob doe have a good voice and i think it is a good song to listen to . i would say that this song ha a lot of potential .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	i am not a fan of this album . the song are all so boring and nothing new . i mean , who doe not love the new cd that are out every day ? this album is boring and uninteresting .
0	this album is great , and if you like eminem , then you should buy this album . i just wish it wa longer , though . this album is good , just the last song is not .
1	this is one of the best cd i have ever bought . i can listen to it over and over again without getting tired or bored . i really appreciate the way that lin manuel miranda ha used some of his own song on this cd . the song are different from the usual lin manuel miranda song . they are original and the lyric are good . the album is very well produced . some of the song remind me of the beatles . i do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing . i do not know if it mean that lin manuel miranda is a musician or a pop artist . i think it is a good thing . it is very enjoyable to listen to . i would recommend this cd to anybody .

0	a very enjoyable recording of brahms opera , but it is not perfect . the voice are good , but the recording is poor .
1	i love love love love love love love love love love love love love
1	this album is great . it is a mix of old school rap and r & b with a little bit of rock . i am a big fan of some of the older rap artist such a dr. dre and ice cube and they have a more laid back style . this is not the same at all . it is a very fast paced and loud rap album . i am sure you will enjoy this album . i would give it a thumb up .

1	this is probably the best classical music cd that i have ever heard . i wa looking for something that wa relaxing and soothing . i love the harmony
1	i bought this album because i loved the cover . it is a lot of blue song with some good spiritual song mixed in . i thought they would be good , but i have been disappointed . the song are decent but i can not get into them . i have been listening to the song that are on the cd and i keep wanting to listen to the one on the cd to get the full effect .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i am not a big fan of this album because the song are not very good . the chorus of lose yourself for example .
1	i have a bad habit of downloading music to store on my ipod to listen to whenever i am bored at work . a friend once told me to stop doing that . this song made me do it .
1	i think this is a great album . i love when group cover artist . if i had only one album this year , this would be it . it is a great mix of different style in a single album . it sound like a modern day beatles album . the one problem i have is that the drum are very repetitive and that is a major drawback for me in album . the production wa good and the song are very interesting . i like that there are different style and different feeling . i think the first few song are not really for me but then it get better . i do not know what the album title is but i like it . i think the album wa recorded from 2005-2008. it ha a lot of different style like blue , rock , hip-hop , funk , jazz and electronica . i like the fact that it ha a lot of different style and i like that it is a mix of different artist . i wish they had another album with different style like this one . i know it is a little pricey but i like that they have multiple album .

0	if you listen to this album , you will realize how much more mature and mature the lyric are ( and the instrumentals ) than on their previous album . it really is a step up for them . i never really liked the band but i am glad they are doing better than ever .
0	this album is the worst thing i have ever heard . it is so boring and lame . i have not listened to it yet . i hope i do not have to .

1	i love meghan trainor . i bought the cd . she sings so beautifully . i love the traditional gospel music .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .

0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	not a bad record , but the vocal are awful . i am not even sure what the album wa called , so i have no clue what this guy is singing about . i mean , i can sing , but this guy sound like he is singing about nothing .
0	a pretty good album , but i wa expecting a lot more .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i like the music of this band but for some reason i do not like them . if you are one of those who like them , the best thing you can do is buy the album . i am not going to buy it . i am going to listen to the song on the cd . if i like them , i will buy the cd .
0	i bought this album on the recommendation of my friend . i am not sure how i feel about it , i like the song a little bit , but i do not like the album . i will probably listen to it again someday , but i would not reccomend it .
0	this song sucked !
1	there are a few good song on the album but kill em all is the reason why i bought it .
0	the lyric to this song are good .
1	looked up this song off the great gatsby and it is an empowering song !
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .
0	twiztid is back , this time with two new album , twiztid volume 2 and twiztid : part 2. twiztid is back with a new record , it is called twiztid volume 2 and it is filled with more song about sex and drug and it is even more fun . this time he ha some original song on this album and you can hear some of his vocal at the beginning of the album and it is a fun album . i will give this album a 4 because it is good . i did not think he would top his first album but he did and that is a good thing . i will give this album 4 because it is good . it is been a long time since i have listened to twiztid , so he ha a lot to live up to . i have heard some people say that he is a bad influence on hip-hop music , but i think he is made some great music and it is a shame that he will not be doing any more . i have listened to this album for about an hour and i am just really angry with him and i do not know why . this album is not good at all . it is just bad . i am really disappointed in this album . i do not know how to describe it because i really like twiztids music , but this is just horrible . i am really disappointed . i hope that he can come back and do something good . it is kind of like if you were to compare him to eminem . there are fan of each of them , but he is one of the best to ever do this , and he is lost a lot of fan over the year . now there are even some people are saying , hey , he is a drug addict , and he need to get a life or something . i do not believe that . he is a good guy , he is just had a lot of bad thing happen to him over the year . i hope he come back and doe something on his own , because who know ? maybe he will do something good . he may be a drug addict , but at least he is a good guy . i hope he come back and doe something good , because he really need to come back . this is not good . this is terrible . i am really disappointed .
1	i am a fan of the jewel song . it wa one of my favorite song when i wa in the car .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

0	i would buy this song again , but it is probably a dud .
0	the best album by them , but that shit is so annoying . the chorus go on and on and on and i do not care about the rest of the album . twiztid is just annoying . they need to get out of the game .
1	i love every song on this cd , it is not even close to a hip-hop cd . the best thing about this cd is that it is not a bluegrass cd .
1	i love this song . it make me feel good and i would like to hear it in person .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

0	lmm is an artist who is truly loved , and i really do love him . i think his music is the best of the 20th century . his music is so different from the music that most people want to listen to . his music is perfect for our time .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	a usual , this album is good , but it is not something that keep me listening to it for hour on end .
0	i do not know if this is a good song or not . i do not know if it is a good song to listen to or not . i do not know how i feel about it . i would not listen to it . i would not buy it . i would never buy this song . i would never listen this song .
1	this cd wa received in a timely manner , and it wa a pleasant surprise to find that it wa exactly what i had envisioned , when i began looking for a cd that i had not yet heard . i do not know how i could have been so blind . the song are very well done and i am very pleased that i have now discovered the music i had been searching for .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !

0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	i really like the album . i do not know what it is about me and this kind of music . i do not know if i have ever been in a crowded room or a room with a lot of people and not been lost in the crowd or on the edge of the crowd singing and moving to the music . if i could sing like this , i would , without a doubt ! i do not know what it is about me , but i get totally lost in this kind of music .

0	this is a good cd , but it is nothing special . it is just the same old stuff over and over . i bought it to see what the hype wa about , but it is the same old stuff i hear over and over . i do not think that is a good idea to buy a cd by a band . i do not think that the band is worth it , but i would buy them again to see if they do anything different .

1	this album is very good . i love the song , bella . the song is good and the lyric are great . the song is fun and i really enjoy the band . i would recommend this album to anyone . i do , however , have some problem with the album . the song are all unique , but the majority of song on the album are not up to par . the lyric are great , but they just seem to lack that something that make the song so fun and enjoyable . the production is great , but the lyric are not a catchy a they should be and the music is not a original . the song are great , but i have a problem with the
0	i like bob dylan and i really like this cd .
1	this is a great song . it is a good song to have in your cd library . it is a good song to play in church a well .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	this is a good rendition of the song , and is worth a download or two . if you want the original version , i would suggest purchasing it from the cd , and not from amazon . the reason i am suggesting this is that amazon claim to have the best quality of the song , and this studio recording is the best that it claim to have . they have been in business for a long time .
0	i am not a twiztid fan , i do not get why they do what they do . i did get the album , and i have to say that i do not have a problem with them . they are talented and i do listen to their music . their music make me happy . i am not sure if i can say the song is just ok , but i do know i am a huge fan of twiztid and their album .

1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .

0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	really an excellent cd .
0	the album start out with a very catchy but cheesy song that i am not sure i agree with . this is followed by the game is over which is a song i really like . the song is nice and you can almost hear the groove in the song . it is not over till it is over is a good song , but there is a very annoying chorus . famous last word is a new song that i will not spoil the story of the song . there is a remix of the song the game is over on this album , but the version of the song i have heard is terrible . it make it sound like the original version just ha a different beat . i do not know why they change the song just to make the song sound better . the song is good because of the beat , but the chorus is very annoying . make me wonder is a very interesting song a it reminds me of this is the remix . it is good to listen to but it is a good song but not like the original . dumb is a good song but i just do not like the song . the game is over is the only one of the song i really enjoy on this album .

0	really good album - a great collection of classic country song - but the cd play so loud that i have to turn it up louder than normal to hear it .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	this song wa very well done and the movie is very good .
0	i bought the deluxe cd and i wa very disappointed .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i love the album . it is a good album .
0	this wa the only song for me , because this is what the album sounded like , but the other song i just did not like .
1	ray benson ha a very good voice . i like his western song , he ha a good voice .
0	this album wa released at the same time a the lord prayer . i did not hear it until i went to the amazon store . i must say , that i like the cover better .

0	i find this song ha a lot of good lyric and if someone can make a full album of these song , i will be very happy . but unfortunately , even though this song is well sung , it is just not good . it is just not good . it is almost the same a a song like one in a million the only difference is that this song ha a bunch of different piece that are almost the same . it is a very boring song . i just can not stand to listen to this song . if i had to choose one thing , it is that i do not like the ending of this song . it is very sad . when the song is over , i am very happy .

0	i bought ray christmas classic after reading many review about the album . i must state that i am not a fan of this album , and i hate that it is on my computer . the song i will be home for christmas is the best song on the album . the song , santa claus is coming to town , is very nice , but the song , it is beginning to look a lot like christmas , is not that great . the song , frosty the snowman , is very nice and very catchy . but the song , christmas morning , is very boring . the song , santa claus is coming to town , ha a very cool beat and sound like they have played it before . the song , frosty the snowman , sound like it wa an original by the beatles . they have done a good job with this song . i would recommend this cd if you like christmas album .
0	this is not my favorite song . it is not the type of music i would listen to . i do not like it because it is too cute . i would have rather listened to sugar sugar a song that i really , really like . i actually like this song , but i guess i just can not stand it . this wa by far my least favorite song i have listened to by meghan trainor . i can not believe this wa free !

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	this ha to be one of my all-time favorite album . the song are so well-written , the orchestration so beautiful , and the music so powerful . what i will say about this album is that it is easy to listen to and very pleasurable to listen to . many of the song have a very nice energy that make you want to dance , sing , or just get down . i think that this album would make a wonderful wedding album a well .
1	this is eminems best album .
0	this is a terrible album . all the song on this album are about the rap genre and it ha nothing at all to do with the artist themselves or their music . i guess if you can not hear it , you do not have to listen to it .
1	ray benson sings this song beautifully . i am surprised that i did not hear it on the radio . i am not much of a radio person , but i do like this .

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	i have just bought this cd for my friend birthday . i love the song , but i bought it for him instead of myself because i thought it would be a nice present for him . i bought this one because i like hearing alternative music . the lyric are very simple and the music is very good .
0	this is a great album ! the only reason i gave this album just four star is because i just do not like the song got ta be somebody baby . i am not a fan of overly overly sung song . i would give this album four star if it wa just one and one-half star .

0	i am not a fan of this band . i have been listening to this cd for a while and i have not gotten it out of my head . i do not know why i bought it .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

1	the group of boy are excellent voice . i had the great opportunity to hear libera at the church in my area of the twin city last sunday . i wa very impressed with his message and delivery . the song are very nice , but the music is not very complex . it is a good cd , but should be taken to the church with a big smile and a great attitude . this would be an excellent message for the church .
0	it wa cool the first time i heard it , but then it got old and i did not like it . i liked the first part of the song . but i did not like it a much a i liked the first part .
1	i love this music and it is a great song . i love the lyric and the beat . i think this is a great song . i really like ms. trainor . this is definitely a great song .
1	i can not wait to get my hand on this cd .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i have listened to this album a few time and i really enjoy the song on it . the song that i enjoy the most are : i am alive , i am alive , and i am alive . i also really like i am alive and i am alive . the song on this album are great and i would recommend it to anybody who like a variety of song and really like good music .

0	i am a hustler is a great song , but i wa not moved by any of the other song . very repetitive . there are a couple of good song on this record , but they do not really stand out or connect with me in any way . i think that they are trying too hard this time and that is what kill any good song .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .

1	i really like the song . it is a fun song .
1	i love this cd !
0	i like the song , but it is not a good song . this song is great though . i love how the song end with the bass and drum playing together , then the song repeat itself . the song ha that familiar sound of being in a club with so much music playing . it reminds me of a club night . i like the song and the music , but it is not a good song .
1	i have not heard
0	i like the song , but the lyric do not really match what i think of a the meaning of the song . i am pretty sure i am going to like the song the next time i listen to it .
1	the song and the message is positive , and the fact that it is in the original style is a plus . the song is about taking responsibility for your life and making a decision to do the thing that you can do to change your life . what i like about this song is that it is not preachy and the message is positive .
1	a masterpiece - i had to buy this .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	a great song , i am not sure why i love it so much but it make me feel good and i will definitely put it on for my next party .
0	i am a christian . i love this artist . i have listened to other song from this artist and love the christmas song however this new song is not something i would buy . it is not good . i would not purchase another cd from this artist .
1	holm is an exceptional smooth jazz musician ; he ha an unusual voice and a remarkable ear for fine melody . most of the track on this cd are original , but there are also piece drawn from holms vast repertoire .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
1	there are many thing wrong with this album , but one thing that is not wrong is the sound quality . i know that this is not a good thing for the sound quality of the recording , but still i listen to it . there are some thing that i can not stand , but i can listen to the opera and i like this recording . i will not listen to the second or third performance . i think that this opera is an excellent opera and i would like to hear the fourth and fifth performance . however , i do not have to listen to the third performance . i will not listen to the second performance because i know that i will not like it . however , i will not listen to the first performance because that will not be worth it . i can not stand the beginning of this opera , but i can listen to the first performance of this opera . i love the opera and i love the music of this opera . it is a shame that i can not listen to the second or third performance .
1	this album is great , it is got some great song , a few good singer , but it is just not for me .
1	i love the way this album play . it sound like it is written by a different writer than eminem .
1	the first one of the two album that i have received from twiztid . i wa a little disappointed . the song are catchy , but not a catchy a i remember . but i still love the song . i enjoy listening to them .
0	i like it . i like the beat and the vocal , but there is just no feeling in this song , it is just very generic .
1	this album combine rock and jazz .
1	i like this song . this is a great song . this is a great song . i really like this song ! this is a great song . i really like this song .
0	a great album to play when you are feeling sad and down , but not too depressed . it is upbeat and is a great way to go to bed .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	while i usually prefer the old school hip hop track over the more mainstream track , this album is not bad . it ha some of the best song of the year , and while the overall quality is a bit lower it doe not go bad listening to it .
0	no big surprise , meghan trainor ha an excellent voice . when she sings , the audience can feel her pain and sorrow . i wish i could connect to her with the new song . i do not like her song , but i do like her voice . it is a very unique voice and an amazing voice at that . i have listened to the new song three time and i just can not connect .
0	clint eastwood is a great western actor . he always seems to have a different character on his eye . this is great music for a classic western .
1	i received an email and a phone call from ray benson . he wa very humble and pleasant . i also received a personal note from him , which wa very sweet . ray ha a beautiful voice and an excellent song writing ability . i will be buying more cd from him .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	this is the best song ever . i am a sucker for love song , and this is one of them . it is very good .
0	i am a big fan of meghan trainor , and i am pretty sure she is a big fan of me too . so , when i saw that meghan had a new album out , i wa really excited . i wa also excited to hear that the album sounded like a mix between the first two x album . but , i wa even more excited when i found out that the album wa a mix of new and old song . i love her song , but her lyric are always so poetic and beautiful . i love her x album , but this album is just perfect . i can not wait for the next x album .
0	this cd is a copy of my cd that wa sent to me . no big deal but did not fit in the box .
0	i purchased this album in order to celebrate the release of the upcoming release of the ghost of tom joad . i am not disappointed , because the album is great , and i have no qualm with the release date . my comment are simply this : the album should be released on cd in the future for those who like a better sound quality . ( though the cd is a tad pricey , it is still a good deal ) .
0	i wa very disappointed to find that i could not buy this album . i had purchased it on cd , and i had been listening to it on my computer without any trouble . i looked online and found that this is probably the reason why this song would not play on the cd player . it wa not a problem with the player , it wa problem with the cd . so i emailed them and asked them why this song would not play on my computer and would not play on the player and they replied that it may be because i had an incorrect version of the song and they would help me remedy the problem . i did not want to pay for a new download , so instead i emailed them and asked them why the song would not play on my player and would not play on the computer and they replied that it wa because the song wa crammed . i asked them to tell me what that mean , and they replied that the song wa not intended to be played . but the song play on my computer in the car .
1	this song is a little bit like a lullaby for a baby . it wa a good choice for a lullaby . it is nice and gentle and it doe not get too annoying . it is a little bit of a love song to start your day . it is a good choice for people with a job , because it is a little soft in the beginning . it is a little bit slow at the beginning and middle , but it build with the song .
1	i have not listened to this yet , but this album is really good . it ha a lot of variety and everything is well done . this is my kind of music . i would not call it alternative , but it is just good listening music . this is a definite must-have .
1	i got this cd for my son . i love it . this is the best on amazon .
0	the first single off the upcoming album , we do not need dembows is such a great song , and is the first song of the album i have heard . i love the way she sings , and i like the fact that she is not afraid to make fun of herself in a song . i think that is one of the thing that made my album more enjoyable than trainors previous album .
1	i think this is a good album . the first cd ha a great acoustic feel to it . the second cd is more of a folk feel with more riff . this is a more bluesy album . i think this is the best blue album of the year . it is really good . i love the acoustic guitar and the lead vocal by the way . you can really tell that there is more than just the blue and folk influence in this album .
1	i just wanted to say that i really enjoyed listening to this album . i found it to be inspiring and full of hope . i will definitely be buying the whole album . i really like the way that the song go together . i like the message . i really liked a lot of the song .
1	great song .

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	i have been singing for many year but always thought
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	to me this cd is not worth the money . i have heard it before and i do not know why i keep buying it . the only thing that keep me listening to it is that one song i have heard several time . i think the cd is okay . the song is kind of cute , but it ha nothing special about it .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	you could easily dismiss this album a a filler effort . it is , but that is not what i am talking about . there is a lot of great material in this album . it is the best eminem album since recovery . i really enjoyed this album and will be buying this album again and i think it will be worth more than a new cd from eminem .
0	i bought this when i wa a kid . i really liked the first two album . i am glad i have this third cd . it is not a horrible cd , but i do not like the sound of it .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .

0	i did not like this one bit . i have been a fan of meghan trainor since the first time i heard her i knew you were trouble . i wa hooked . i have been a fan ever since . i am sad to see her fall apart but i will still buy her cd .
1	this album is so good . it is got a little gospel-rock at time , but it is really good . she is got a great voice , and she is got a great songwriting style .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	this movie is great ! it is in the movie !

0	the last few track on this album are really good . i think they are done by the same studio . it ha a lot of good track .
1	a a fan of opera , i wa intrigued by reading the following before purchasing . i am not sure if i would have been a drawn to the opera or the music if the review did not have that first sentence . when i did purchase , i wa surprised at how much i love this cd . i have heard the opera a number of time and each time i had to stop listening to hear the music for a moment to give my ear a break . this cd make it easy to hear the opera with the music playing so that i can hear every word . it is not only my favorite opera but also my favorite music .
1	this is a good album . i have only heard it once before , but i remember enjoying it . i have listened to it quite a few time since then . i do not really know what to say about this album , but i can say that i really enjoy it . i can not really decide whether i like it or dislike it . if i am being honest , i can say that this album is average . it could be a bad album , but it is definitely not a bad album .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	great work by the guy , no doubt .
1	this is a great song . it is the kind of song that you can sing in the shower , in the car , anywhere , really .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .

0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	this is a great new album from the group i have been listening to for a few year now . i love the fact that they put out music . i am glad to see that they are still going strong .
1	i finally got around to buying this album after hearing it on the radio and i am glad i did . this album is all about the music and a much a i do not like the majority of the song on this album none of them should take the place of a good hip hop album . the production is top notch and the vocal are all top notch . it is a great little album to listen to and a good follow on to the last album .
0	they play mostly cover , but i like the way they play . they do not play a lot of original , but i like them . i am not sure what to think about the music . it is good , but it is not very good . i do not like the lyric , and the vocal are not good . i think they are average , but it might be my own opinion .

0	i liked this song , but it wa not a good a those i have heard by them .
1	i have listened to this album many time , and it is very good . the album contains many good song , but the song bury me , bury me is my favorite . i thought i would never become a rapper . it is very difficult to become a rapper . it is one of the best feeling i have ever experienced .
1	i am a worship leader and i would love to have the cd . it is a great message on the unity of all thing in life . i have used the cd in my worship team meeting and in my home . i would recommend it . i give it 3 star .
0	the only reason i keep listening to this , and i am not a huge fan of the genre , is because of danzig voice .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	this album ha some great song , but some of the lyric are too profane to be used in a christian environment .
1	i like the song and would buy it again .
0	i have to say , this is the first time i have heard this song . it sound like the song i heard on the radio . i think it is a great song , but i have to say , i can not listen to the song on the radio . it sound so different - the voice doe not sound very good . i think i will get the vinyl for the song i had heard . i think i heard the song on the radio , but i do not remember . i am not sure why i have not been able to listen to this song .
0	this song start out slow with a really good beat but then the lyric get to be too weird and go on for too long and get boring .
1	he sings really well , but his lyric are very simple .
1	this song is my all time favorite from nancy sinatra album . it is a beautiful ballade . i do not know if anyone ha tried to put this song on cd yet . i would buy a copy !
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i am a fan of this artist . i like this song .
0	i thought this concert wa better than the one at the end of the concert with mink deville it wa so bad , people booed when they sang with the group . i wa really disappointed . i hope they come back soon .
1	really cool song . the sound quality is very good . the lyric are also very good . they fit the mood of the song very well . the performance and the vocal are very good . the only negative for me is the fact that the song sound kind of like a country song . i really liked their sound more than the actual music though .

1	this is an album that i have listened to several time and i still keep re-listening to it . this is one of my all time favorite . i have listened to it several time and it ha always been a very good album .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	this album just show the potential that the group had . the group did not disappoint . i do not think there is anyone on here that ha not heard some of this group music . i wa glad to see that the member all had a voice on here ( even the lead singer , who had a bit of a hard time singing ) and they all sounded amazing . i am giving this album a five star rating .
0	this song is awesome .
0	i love this album but i would have to say i wa a little disappointed with the vocal on the 2nd and 3rd album . the lead vocalist voice is very pleasant but the rap are not very good . there are a few good moment in the second one but they are too few . in the 3rd album the rap are great and the vocal are very good . also the album is very long with some really good song but i think they may be too long for some people . it is very good but not really my thing .
1	a great album if you like choral music . this band really know how to play choral music .
0	quien no tiene palabras para cantar ? y hay algo de eso malo en estos disco . en este disc , quien no tiene palabras para cantar suena como si su mamá se hubiera puesto la cabeza en una bocacha . una canción e muy importante para los trabajadores y otras persona , pero e muy lindo comprender que la canción no e tan importante como ante . quienes no tienen voz para cantar no pueden cantar . estos disco no pueden hacer más que hacerme más fuerte . si quieren ponerle un tapon en la boca a una mujer mejor pongan la canción de la mujer en la radio , aunque sea como usted y yo en la canción de su mamá .
0	this album wa a little disappointing to me . overall i think he is doing some of his best work . but the most disappointing part wa that the album wa boring to listen to . i will probably listen to it again and get it cleaned up . overall i give this album a 4/5 .

0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	the album is better than i thought it would be . it is really a good album with lot of pop rock song . the song are fun and have good lyric , which is a plus . the only bad thing is that song like will not back down and bad girl are repetitive . they could have the song cut down a bit to make the song more interesting . overall i am really satisfied with this album . i can not wait to hear the music video . i am not a big fan of the singer but her voice is really good . i am really looking forward to watching the music video now .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a great way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber music and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) , and the violin sonatins . the recording of the sonatina , included , wa peter serkin , an excellent pianist , i have heard in concert numerous time . the sonatinias were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for a bargain price this is one of the best cd i have bought .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	this song and their music reminds me of song for my mother .
0	this cd is terrible ! there is nothing good on it . it ha no real worth . you will be disappointed .
1	i enjoy listening to this cd . i have never heard anything quite like it .
0	i like twiztid a lot but this album is really not good . they are just a bunch of asshole . the first song is so stupid and annoying , the second song is so stupid and annoying , the third song is so stupid and annoying , but the last song is okay because it is about their fight with the government . i will miss this band , they really have a good sound .
0	i really like the music on this cd . i have not listened to it , but i have the cd i bought for my brother . i wa going to buy him this cd , he liked it too . my brother is in a band , i have been listening to his cd for a while . i have been listening to j.b. i just do not know if i could go back to a live version of a song . i do not know what to do about him .
0	this is a wonderful opera . one of the most beautiful and moving .
1	this wa a very good album . the first album wa a little disappointing to me because of the repetitious chorus and the fact that they do not have a definite style . the music is good and most of the song are about life . now this album is an all time favorite .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	i have only listened to this cd a couple of time , but i am very glad i purchased this cd . i really like the choral singing . i love the harmony . the lyric are well written . i think the cd is well-mixed and produced . i really enjoy the cd .

0	i love this song . good song are hard to find , and this one is just too good .
0	it ha a great beat and the lyric are interesting .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	this song is great .

1	this album , eminems greatest hit , is a great album . i had it on constant rotation since i wa a teen . i believe that it is the most diverse collection of music in existence . i am very glad to see the album return . i wa afraid if he died he will leave behind a great album , or his music would die off . it did not happen . i am an eminem fan ! god bless .

1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	i like the lyric .
1	this is a good cd , but it should have been a triple album with the other album .
1	i love his voice . he is a very nice guy and an excellent singer .
0	this is a good album , with lot of slow song , in this case , some of them ( the first one ) are slow and peaceful , but they are not very memorable . the second song is interesting and ha a good melody , but it doe not have any lyric , just a repeating sound . the third song is boring , and the fourth song is just plain boring . this album is average . i would give this album a 4.5
1	this is one of the best album i have ever listened to .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	i wa really hoping this would be good . it is not .
0	i will not listen to this disc .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

1	i think this album is wonderful .
0	i have had a cd of this already and my opinion is still the same . these guy are so good i do not even know what to tell you .
1	i am still new to the world of schubert but i am loving it . he is not just an amazing composer , he is an amazing musician . the recording is good with the exception of one track . i am not sure if the recording wa flawed from the studio or if the mix engineer could really improve the track . overall i think this is a great schubert album to start out with .
0	i had seen this one in a store and bought it for 99 cent . i wa very surprised to find out that it is the exact same album that i bought for 99 cent last year , but at the time i thought i wa buying something different . this is a really good album . i love the sound of the orchestra that play it .
1	this is an amazing album . this band is so talented . this band is a great band . i am so excited they are on this album .
1	i bought this a a gift for my wife . she loved it . i got the cd and put on my mp3 radio with my headphone in my car and drove through new york city singing the song . it wa a very nice experience . the lyric are very good .
0	it is been a long time since i have listened to this song . it is been a very very long time . it ha been so long since i have heard this song , that i am not sure what to make of it . i do not know what to make of it , and a i listen to it , it sound somewhat familiar , so i know it is not old . but it might a well be .
1	this is the first album i got off of amazon that i liked . it is a very good album , but i do not like that the song are a little too country for me . they are good song , but not my favorite . i like some of the song on this album , but not all of them .
0	i do not know what i am looking at . this wa purchased at a cd store for $ 13 . i think it wa a mistake . i mean , this album is not terrible , but it just doe not sound like a r. kelly album . it sound like a bunch of other people album mixed together . i just do not like the vocal on this album . i just do not like the sound of the vocal . they are just like they were recorded by a guy with a sore throat .
1	this is a very good song , and it is one that you can listen to over and over . you will hear the music again and again . it is a good song to listen to over and over .
1	this is an excellent compilation of song .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	i like this song . i like the music . it is just a little boring .
1	this is an album that i really like . i like the song on it .
1	i am a big fan of this song .
1	i really enjoyed jewel album . i am a big fan and really like her music . i would buy this cd again .
1	this cd is great . i like it .
0	this is a very solid album . you are definitely getting a lot of the song that have been released . i am a big fan of eminem , but i have not actually listened to too many of his album , so i can not tell you which song are really good or not . i can tell that this album ha some good track . i like the fact that there is not one song that sound repetitive . the track are not bad , though . there are a few track that i did not like , but i still enjoyed it .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	i do not understand how this album made it to amazon website . i am not into the music genre , but i love the album cover and the music . it is a must have .
0	i thought this album had a lot of potential , but it just did not work out . i am really disappointed .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
1	this is a good song to listen to a well a an album . the vocal are powerful and the song is very good . i love the different sound that they are going for . i am not at all a metal fan , but this song is a good one to listen to and listen to a well a the album .
1	this is by far the best song on this album . i love the guitar and lyric .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	i have listened to this collection of song on several occasion and am always impressed with each new recording . the song are played by schubert , beethoven , boccherini , mozart , beethoven , and hummel . each artist brings different strength to the table . each of the recording ha a different feel to the music , yet they all sound like schubert .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	this album is

0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
0	there are so many thing wrong with this album , but the worst of them all is the fact it doe not even have any melody .
1	this cd is an enjoyable christmas cd , but not the most creative or exciting . the band is very tight and the vocal harmony are very good . i would definitely recommend this cd .
0	i have got a feeling the next day after listening to this album will be the first day i look at my watch and realize my time is up . but i have already missed out on one beatles album . so i guess this qualifies .
1	i am pleased with the sound of this album . it is very good music . my only issue with it is that the album is a bit lengthy . it is hard to listen to for a long period of time . this album is well worth the purchase because the music is very nice . i recommend this album !

1	this is a very good album . the production is great !
1	it is a great mix of music with a message . it is a very very positive one .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	i bought it from amazon . it is one of the best cd i have ever bought . i will buy all my music from amazon . love this cd !
1	i love this album ! i enjoy the music but the lyric are a little bit of a letdown . the only song i would like to find is fool to have no faith or let u go . some of the song on this album are very catchy . i will continue to buy this album until something better come along .
0	i love the song , hang on by ray benson . i would like to have the whole album , but i can not find it !
1	this song make me smile . i wish i could hear it more often .
1	this is the best album i have heard this year . i love the instrumentals , the instrumentals are great and the vocal are good . this is a great album .
0	if you like eminem , you should definitely buy this album . it is worth the money .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .
0	i like this cd , but i did like the cd with the 16 song , so i wa confused . i found the cd that had 16 song to be a better cd for me .
0	i am an adult that love the music of the 80 and 90 . i like the music from the 80 , but i do not know any of the song on this album .
1	i really like this place . i have been buying from here for year . i think that it is a great store for buying cd . i like the atmosphere here .

1	i wa listening to this song for over an hour . it made me feel like being a man wa easy .
0	this is the first cd of the ray & the boy collection . it is by far the most enjoyable cd i have ever heard . the arrangement are very well written and performed , the song are very well sung , and the style of the song is very relaxed . there are several great song on this cd , and i believe that it is very effective for small choir .
0	i like this song .
1	i found this album to be very depressing . i do not like the song being so sad and depressing , and i do not really care for the song being so positive , while the rest of the album is full of positive song . this is just my opinion of this album . i will give it a 3 out of 5 star , and an overall good album .
0	i can not imagine a better disc for a discerning listener than this . it doe not contain any of the well-known or expected work . this is an incredibly complete collection of music , including the complete work by schubert , schumann , and weber . it is the perfect disc for the discerning listener .
0	i am really glad i got this cd . i listened to it when i wa a kid . i think the song are good . i just do not think i want to listen to them again .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i have never had a bad experience with this company and i have bought over 1000 cd from them in the past 10 year .
0	i thought the lyric were cool and the instrumentation wa great . the only problem is that the song just is not very good .
1	i am a musician and this is a great cd . very professional and very well recorded . i am sure that it ha been recorded to the highest of standard .
0	i am not a huge fan of christmas song but i did like this one . my only complaint is the song is only 3:58 long . there are time when i wish the song wa longer but i could live with it . i would put it on my list but i would have to take my time listing all of the song . i hope it get a re listen in the future .
1	i love dave g

0	i like it a lot , but i do not remember how i found it .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
0	this is not the most enjoyable album , but it is certainly a lot better than most of the other offering on the site . the first song is an excellent piece of work , and the remaining song are very good . i found that the song were not very memorable , but that they were the kind of song that i could easily forget . my problem with the song wa that i did not like the lyric . this album is one that is definitely worth listening to , but you should not be purchasing it .

1	i have always been fascinated by the ability of woman to sing such incredibly bad , bad , bad song , yet they sound so good . the lyric and music are well written and the vocal are very good . the instrumentation is good , too . i would recommend this album to everyone , especially those who want a bit of variety .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .

0	one more time by jewel from the cd the complete jewel box ( cd ) . i have read amazon complaint on this song and it seems jewel is trying to be a pop star and a folk singer at the same time . this song is on the cd the complete jewel box ( cd ) . it is a very good song with a great message . i have listened to jewel one more time song at least 5 time and it is a great song . it is jewel and not some other artist ! what is wrong with her . why did she change her whole style of singing and singing a song like this now . can not sing the blue anymore . or can not sing any blue . i would rather listen to the blue and have a song like this a the last song on the cd . she should have stayed with her soul . why did she leave her soul in the studio to be a pop star ?
1	i love the opening song i love you .
0	this album is a step down from her debut . i loved her debut album , but this is a step back . i do not know what the album is leading up to . i am not disappointed , i am just not interested . i would have liked to have seen more of her music . i think her first two album were good but this is a step back .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	i have not heard the full score of this opera , so i can not tell you how i feel about it . i have been looking for a good opera in the christian music industry for a very long time . i have been looking for many year . i wa not sure if i wanted to purchase it or not , but i decided to purchase it on amazon.com . i thought that it wa a very good purchase . i really did not like this cd very much . i have listened to it a couple of time , but i am not really sure what to say . i will be happy to listen to it if i get an opportunity to do so .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	this is a very beautiful album , but not for me . the music is beautiful , the singer even better . but , the lyric do not work for me . i wa listening to it yesterday and still have trouble reading the lyric . but , if you are into meandering , dreamy , classical ballad , this is definitely a good album . i think this is only one of her best album .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
1	this album ha some of the best guitar playing i have heard in a long time . great musicianship and great playing .
0	i love it , but it is not an original song . i think they should change the lyric to make it more interesting .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	i believe this is the best album of my lifetime . it is a great blend of hard rock , blue , and country . i have been listening to it for year now .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	i think it is great . i am just disappointed in the fact that i do not understand the lyric . i understand the tune and it make the song great . but i do not understand the lyric . i feel the singer is singing but i could not understand what she is saying . i have to say that this cd is going to be very disappointing if you have never listened to jewel music . i will now wait for her cd that come out next month .

0	i wa a little disappointed that the album is only one cd . the cd is also the same price a the one-disc version , but at least you get to go back to listen to the song you have already listened to . the cd is only one disc , and is a little smaller than the original . i would think that this is a good idea a a college student .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !

1	the first time i saw the rolling stone , i had to listen to them . i wa in high school and wanted to be a musician . i wasnt sure about rock music at the time . i listened to the beatles and the stone . i liked both . the beatles had a few song that i liked , but i did not like many of the song they had . all i remembered from the stone wa brown sugar and goin home . get off of my cloud wa the only song i really liked from the beatles . i could not understand why people would like them so much .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	i bought this album a an all in one cd instead of buying the other two album . this cd is by one of my favorite band and this cd ha to be one of the best albums/cds i have ever bought . i just thought it would be nice to have all three album in one box . the second cd is very good and you are right about the vocal being a little too high . not that i mind the vocal on this cd , the song on this cd are just so good . this is definitely a great cd .

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	this is better than i thought it would be . it is good , but not great .

1	this is a great compilation of schubert music .
0	the cd is a really good one . for all those who are looking for a little background music to go with the movie , this is a good choice . i like the music but i wish there would have been a little more on the song .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	the song wa okay . i do not think it is a very good song . the lyric are weak .
1	i love this song . i thought it wa a great song but a i listened to it during worship , i wa shocked how long and high it went . the last verse really got me !
1	i love this cd . it is excellent to listen to in the car at work and to listen to while i am getting ready for bed .
0	this is not a very good collection of music from the 1960s to present . it includes some of good music of the 60 and 70 .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	this song is a great motivator . it is a great reminder that god is our greatest strength .
1	this is great !
0	[ w ] [ w ] [ w ] this song is a good song .
0	for someone who is a fan of schubert , i found this collection to be very disappointing . the only thing i really like is the lied performed by the piano trio and the quartet but the whole collection is so lacking in song that i have never heard before . i wish i had more money to spend on a decent collection of schubert but at this price i will probably stick to my cd collection .
1	i have found this cd to be very good , it ha the right song for country and western fan . i had a cd from another company and it did not have this cd . this ha been a very good cd for country and western fan . the song range from the country and western to the modern , all of which are good .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	this is another song from twiztid that i really like . it is got a great chorus and it is got a great beat . it is got a great flow . it is got a great groove .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
0	i have always been a fan of this band . i like how they have a wide range of talent . my favorite band is the who . the only time i hear the who are when the who live at the hollywood bowl come on . i really like this band . i have not bought the ep , but i would like to . i would probably buy the ep from amazon . i have been listening to this band for a long time . i like their music . i like the way they are able to put out an ep and still get a lot of attention . i would not say that they are one of my favorite , but i like their overall sound and style .
1	i love it . it is the third cd by this awesome band that i have bought . the first two were very good , but the new one is more in my opinion . the band just need to keep the same energy and passion that they had when they were first starting out . after having bought the cd already , i am going to buy more so i can get every song . this is the best cd to buy that i have had so far . i am very glad that i bought this one . i can not wait to buy the next cd .
1	i wa pleasantly surprised by this album . i would recommend this album to anyone . the album is diverse and ha a variety of song . the music is a little repetitive at time , but it is still good .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
0	the first cd wa good . the second cd is good . the third cd is really good .
1	ray benson is an artist with a voice that many can not resist . i have listened to several album that feature his music and the last one i listened to wa his christmas album . this is a beautiful cd that i would recommend to anyone who enjoys ray bensons music .
0	i like the song , but i do not like the singer . very strange voice .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
1	nice !
1	love the collection . i like the variety of sound .
0	i bought this cd on the recommendation of a friend . what i got wa a copy of a cd i purchased from a local record store .
0	i purchased this cd a a gift to my daughter . i thought it would be a nice gift for her , a she ha been asking for a cd for christmas . i wa very disappointed in this cd . i have been listening to this cd for about 2 week and have never been so offended by a cd before . the song are about a christian god and the love of jesus . i am very offended by the song . i have listened to this cd for about 2 week and have never been so offended by any cd in my life . i am offended by the blasphemous word and the use of the name of jesus in the song . i am sorry to be so blunt but i do not believe in god and i have found no answer to my question in god .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	this album ha a very good quality to it . i would recommend it to anyone who like rap . i like twiztid and i feel like this album could have been much better . i do not love twiztid a a rapper , but i think he ha a lot of potential . i would recommend this album to fan of rap music .

0	i do think that the bunch is one of the best blue band i have ever heard . i think that they are very talented and i do not think that i will ever like anything else produced by them . they are very talented . i have listened to this cd twice . the only thing that i have trouble with is that i think that they should have recorded more than one song . but that is just me . i think that this cd is a great cd and that i would add it to my collection .
0	this is a pretty great cd . it is not a good a the previous cd but it is still a really good listen .
0	this album reminds me of the early sixty . it is very good , but the vocal are very annoying .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
1	i just bought the cd and i love it .
0	i bought and put this cd in my car . i have only listened to it once . i wasnt really impressed . i would like to return it . i am not sure i want to keep it .
0	it is alright ! but it is not that great of a cd . it is okay .
1	this song really is good , it is good vocal and good percussion . it ha a nice beat and good music , it is worth listening to .
1	i have used this cd to help me get through the bad day , and i find it very valuable . i would recommend it to anyone who doe not want to listen to an endless barrage of profanity .
0	i have heard many other review of your site , but yours is the best so far . i would like to thank you for all the hard work .

1	this is a really good cd , i love the song on it .
0	this is a great song , but i think it is a little bit too pop . it is not a bad song , it is just the group i have been listening to ha been a little bit more like jewel voice . i like the song a lot but it is kind of hard to place because it is jewel and i am not really into the group .
1	i bought all the album . i bought the clean version first . i love this album so much . i bought this one and i liked it .
0	i really like this album .

1	i really like the message in this song .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	i am a sucker for anything by the late , great joe ely . but this is not a great album , nor doe it deserve to be called a classic . a a whole , it is a middling effort that doe not stand out for any particular reason . but if one song is to be singled out , it ha to be the great unknown .
1	this album is one of my favorite album of all time . i just can not say enough good thing about this album . it is such a great blend of everything i love about eminem and just everything else that make up a great album . this album hold a place in my heart a one of my favorite .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	meh . not really . meh . meh . meh . meh . meh . meh . meh !
1	this song wa really good .
0	if you are a smooth jazz fan , you need to get this album . the album doe not have the usual slick , polished jazz sound that many listener have come to expect over the past several year . it is a raw , organic sound that is hard to define . it is the type of music that people like to put in their someday album . if you are a jazz fan , you need to get this album .
1	i like a lot of song but i do not remember the name of the artist .
1	i think this cd is great for relaxation .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	i have been searching for a cd containing the best of jazz , blue , and bluegrass . this cd is an excellent opportunity to catch some of the best music that ha been recorded in the last few year .
0	i just love jewel . she is beautiful ! this is one of her best album . you can tell that she ha been putting a lot of time into this and is putting more into it . i would love to see her do a concert in nyc . i have seen her at the beacon in new york . she ha a great voice !
1	i went to a show of hers last year and it wa a fantastic experience . i have since heard her live in nashville and it is simply amazing . i have seen her perform live at various venue and she is truly an amazing artist . i really had a great time at her show . i have enjoyed her music and now i am anxiously awaiting her next album . i look forward to hearing it and am anxious to listen to it .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	smooth jazz is a form of music that i enjoy listening to . i like to listen to jazz for the energy of it . i like the smoothness of the music . i like the groovy beat but i also like the energy of the music . a for this cd , i like the music on it . it is a great compilation of some of the most popular song that were played by our high school band . this album is for all the people that love smooth jazz .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	this is my first time recording audio from inside a church and i wa amazed at how much i liked it . i do not know if this will become my favorite album but it wasnt the most expensive so i am happy about that . the cd is a little scratchy when you first start it but i expected that and it is not hard to ignore . i have not listened to it all the way through yet but i will . i am excited to find other friend with whom i can share this cd .
1	i love the song .
1	a great , positive song .
1	this is a great cd . i had heard of this but had never purchased it . it is an awesome cd that really help people worship god . the only problem is , i have never heard of the cd before i purchased it .
0	you get the same song over and over and over . i do not know what you are listening for .
1	i have listened to this cd several time now and i really like it . it is a great collection of song . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	great album
1	i bought this album from my brother for his birthday and he really enjoyed it . he loved this song so much that he wanted to buy it for his girlfriend . i am not really sure why . i mean this is a great song . i have not listened to this song on my ipod for quite some time . i used to listen to this song on my ipod very frequently when i wa in high school . but i have not listened to this song on my ipod for quite some time now . i have listened to this song on my ipod but then i started listening to a lot of jazz music and i started listening to a lot of r & b music . so i stopped listening to this song on my ipod . i just finished listening to this song again on my ipod . i have now finished listening to this song on my ipod . i have listened to this song on my ipod for several hour now and i really enjoyed it . i really love this song . i really like this song and i really enjoy it . but i have to say that i have been listening to the music of this generation for quite some time now and this song is not what i like the most . i have listened to a lot of r & b and hip hop music for about six year now and i listen to a lot of jazz music and i listen to a lot of classical music a well . i have listened to a lot of smooth jazz music for year and it ha been on my ipod for quite some time now . this song is not what i listen to the most .
0	this album ha a lot of song that are very , very good , but also ha some song that i would probably not feel comfortable listening to . some of the song are so good that i want to listen to them over and over again . some of the song do not stand up to repeated listening . i can listen to this album a few time and feel like i have learned something , but then i move on to something else for a while . i would recommend this album , but i would not listen to it over and over again .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	i am very happy with my purchase . i love it ! i bought it for my wife and myself , so it wa a gift for her for christmas and i have been listening to it a lot . she love it too ! it is a great album !
0	the song are good . the lyric are not exactly right . i am not sure if she is supposed to be singing a song or singing about a song , and the word do not make sense . i do not know how she can sing so high over a low note .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	it wa a very good purchase . i think it should be more popular .
1	this song wa great . it make you feel good and uplifted .
0	this is the best song of the day . it is got a really good beat , but the lyric get super repetitive .
1	i bought this album because i liked all the song , but i have a problem with the lyric . they are good but i do not know how to understand them .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .
0	i wa so excited to use my new iphone to listen to the song , but it wa a complete waste of time .
0	ray benson band are great and have played in some of the best venue in the country . i wish i had this cd year ago .
1	la vida e un libro de la noche is a great record , and i would recommend to everyone .
1	i love to listen to rock music .
1	i enjoy listening to this cd .
1	this album make you think and feel like a family . the song are so beautiful .
0	this is a horrible cd . it sound like a bad jewel album . her voice is too soft . her lyric are flowery .
1	i have found something new on this cd . it is the music of schubert , and it can be played by any pianist . i love listening to classical music , especially schubert . so far , i have listened to the song ich mus leiden and i like it very much . i have never heard or listened to any of schubert song before .
0	i have been looking forward to hearing this cd for a long time . i wa really excited when i found out about it . i thought it wa going to be a good cd . i do not like the music much , but i think it is going to be good . i bought the cd at a great price and am looking forward to listening to it . but , i just can not get past the fact that the cd is not for me . it is not a bad cd , but it is not for me . i do not like the lyric much , but i understand them and i do not mind them . the music is good , but the lyric are just not for me . i do not have a good connection with this artist , and i do not like the music so i will not be buying it .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
1	you have to see this movie !
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	all my cd have been here and the customer service wa great . i bought cd from here for a long time . i am very happy with my purchase .
0	an interesting cd with some good song , but the song sound like they are recorded in a tiny little computer , which is bad because it make me think that someone really did not give it much thought .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i love this album ; so very inspiring . i thought this album wa going to be a collection of other song from the first album , but i am glad it is not . i love the song and the lyric . i am a big fan of songwriter and artist like these who make song that really touch me .
0	i think that the music is good , but the lyric do not make any sense . like , how the hell doe i do not got no money mean ? it sound like a cry for help . my ear are ringing from the volume in the background and the lyric to the most part , but i did like the clean version .
0	one of the best collection of schubert i have ever seen . it ha a great variety of schubert lied , work , piano trio , and chamber music . the performance are excellent .
0	i have been listening to this cd for over 20 year . it is still one of my favorite . i like the sound of the music . i like the arrangement , but the vocal and the lyric are not very good . i would rate this cd a c+ .
0	this is a great christmas song ! it is a great way to get you in a christmas mood . it is a good song .
1	an excellent classical music cd . i listen to it often . i am a classical music lover and have a lot of classical music album . i just bought this cd and i am very happy with it .
1	i really like this song , i love the lyric a well .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	i like the music and the lyric . however , the song are not all that great . some of them are just very basic and uninteresting . the song they used to start this album is the best song on this disc but they took it too far and it just doe not fit . i can not really say that i like it because i did not really like it .
0	i like this album , but it is not my favorite eminem album . i do not really put much emphasis on the lyric .
1	i think this wa the best movie i have seen in a long time .
0	i love the way the singer voice sound . i also love the way the bassline is played . i guess it just sound like it wa recorded by a man with a sore throat .
1	this song is very good . i love this song . it ha a really great beat .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	just got this album . i love it . the first half is great . the second half is great . this album is more fun and upbeat .
1	this is the first recording of schubert lied . it is a wonderful experience .
1	i love this album . i feel like the song are too similar , but i still love them . there are some great song on this cd . there is a song called i need you that i think is the best song on the album . i think the song wa written by toni and the boy . i have to admit , i liked the title track , and i did not care for the rest of the song , but that is just me .
0	this is a good song , but i do not think it is very country . i think the lyric were a little forced . i do not know what the guitar part is supposed to represent . i do not understand the lyric , either . i love the song , but i do not think it is country .

0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	i am not a fan of the opera .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	this is an excellent classical music album . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic album .
0	i wa really disappointed that this is an un-editable master , i am glad it is a clean version with no copyright infringement .
1	this album is amazing . i love this cd . i love meghan trainor and i really hope that she will release another album . i have listened to this album twice already and i am still really enjoying it . i love that it is a mixture of her old stuff and newer stuff . i think it is a really great cd . i really hope she release another cd .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	this is an awesome song . it a great song . it a great song . it a fine song .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	this album wa probably my favorite album since i am a fan of twiztid . i loved their early stuff but they went back to the same old style . they tried to make a new stuff that wa not too much of a rip off of the old stuff , but i guess they did not care too much about what fan like u liked . i really hope they come back with something fresh and original .
0	the song is catchy , but not the best song on this album . it is a little boring , but not so bad . the lyric are great , the music is great , the instrument are great , the backing vocal are great . it is just a little boring .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	this song is terrible to listen to , but it doe make me feel good .
1	looked up this song off the good wife . it an empowering song and really fit the theme of the movie !
1	very nice . there are only two song i do not like , but i am not so picky when it come to music . the first one , the day is not over , is the only one i like , but i may just have to wait until later in the year to return to hear it again . the i will be back song , however , is very nice and ha a very smooth , almost smooth sounding , guitar part .
1	if you want a classical album with an amazing sound , then this is the one for you .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	i like the album a lot , and i think the music is nice , but i think they could have listened to it a little more when they did it . the song are so beautiful , and when you listen to them , it brings you back to your childhood . i do not like their version of it is a love song because it is boring . and i do not like the song el gran maestro and cantar de amor . they are just not very original and good .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	i am a fan of the band , but i still think the cd is great .
1	i really enjoyed the cd .
1	the album is good , but the song can be better .

1	i have only heard this work by bach twice , once when i attended the boston symphony orchestra concert , and once when i listened to it on the internet . it is a fine score and well performed . the orchestra play well , and the conductor is well known in the classical music community .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	this album would be great for a christmas gift .
1	raybenson ha a very unique way with word , a very unique and beautiful way with word . this is a great hip hop cd .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	i wa looking forward to this album for a long time and i am not disappointed . the first 10 song on this album were good and very catchy , and the middle and last 10 song are very good too . the song candy is especially nice and i like it very much . the only drawback is that the song just do not get enough airtime . i just hope that they will make another album soon .
0	this collection is a mish-mosh of different genre and style of music , from the mainstream to the underground . there is no real cohesive sound , especially with the exception of the song that are the same genre ( i.e . the pop-punk oriented rock the vote and the new york groove of dancefloor-oriented house music ) . it is a shame because the song here do have some redeeming quality , especially the lead single , we are the native , which is a great , catchy song with a great hook and message . rock the vote on the other hand is a good song with a good message and sound , but it is basically an anti-obama song that doe not really add anything to the album . and the last song on the album , new york groove , is basically an extended club song with some lyric about how great it is to be from new york . but like all of the song on this album , it is all over the place and there is nothing about it that make it worth listening to .
0	nothing special
0	schubergs music is beautiful and schubert voice capture the beauty of the schubert music .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	gettin over you is a good song . it is not one of my favorite but it a good song . i like this song because i can relate to this song . it the type of song which make you want to jump on stage and sing and dance . this song is a perfect song for that .

0	i can not say that i am a fan of christmas music . this cd ha a very nice rendition of the christmas carol . if you are a fan of the christmas carol , this cd will be a good choice . it is also available for download . i would recommend giving this cd a few spin and then giving it a listen to see if it is something you would like to purchase .

1	this is my first album since i had to have the kid go to sleep . the new cd is pretty good . i like this song better than i did the one i bought in a store .
0	i think this album is very boring . it is not that bad , but i do not really enjoy it . it is just very boring and repetitive . i would recommend this album to people who want to know more about thalia .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	i bought these cd to listen to while working on my car . i would highly recommend them for people who have a lot of people .
0	this album is not for the faint-hearted . it will not win any award , but this album wa probably the best i have listened to since the day of the new wave . it ha got to be one of the most important album of the last 10 year . this album is very personal and at time i felt like i wa in the presence of a great singer . the lyric were very meaningful . i love this album . and i have listened to it several time .

1	this album is very good . the music is good .
0	i really like this song but a couple of thing have changed me from a fan to a critic . 1 ) i noticed that the original artist ha changed his or her name to kenny . i believe this is a bad decision for the original song , a the original artist is a true original . 2 ) there is a short version of this song with the right word missing . i believe this is a very good decision for the song a it allows the song to be played without confusion . 3 ) the cd ha a mistake in the back cover . it say that this is the deluxe version , but it is not . there is only the standard version available . this is a small mistake , but one that really matter to me .

1	i am a big fan of twiztid . i have a daughter and have been wanting to get her a cd of this band . i just got the latest update on amazon and it is the worst album that i have ever heard . the music is nice , but the lyric make me cry . this is the best album that i have ever heard . it sound like it is a real band and not a bunch of rapper trying to sell drug . i do not want to live in a world where people have to deal with these type of lyric .

0	i am not sure i would call this a singing class . i think this may be an expression class but i am not sure . i am a singer and my teacher is a singing teacher . he ha a lot of great idea for singing that i need to work on . i really enjoyed the class , especially the breathing technique . a big part of the class wa learning about the effect singing ha on the body and the mind . my singing teacher also suggested that i sing a song that is very challenging for me to sing .

0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	he ha a good voice . i would like to see him in a band , but he doe not have the band that i would like to see .
0	it a catchy , positive song , but the lyric come off a a little self-absorbed . a rock & roll kind of song . it is good for a nice night out , but not for the serious listener .
0	this song is a masterpiece .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
1	i picked up this album on the recommendation of a friend . i wa listening to it while sitting on the beach at a beach park in australia . i bought it with the intention of listening to it while i wa traveling to new york city the next day . i heard the band i had been listening to for year wa playing at a club in new jersey on july 4th . i knew it wa going to be a good night . i decided to check it out . i got there and there wa a band playing in the parking lot of the club . i decided to go in and see if they were worth it . i like a band when i have an awesome new album to listen to . this band is

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i think this album is good . it ha a lot of good song . however , crazy is what i do wa the best song on the album . i think this album ha a good chance of being a hit if it doe not have a hit . i really like the song you are on my mind . i like outlaw . i like you are mine . i like outlaw a lot . i will never break your heart i like . i love you i like . wasted i like a lot . outlaw is a little repetitive but it not bad . you can not hurry love is another favorite .
0	i love the voice . she really sings it well . i like the guitar .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .

0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
0	it is a good cd . i will have to buy it again .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .

1	i thought this wa good , until i got to the end . i think it should be longer .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
1	i have listened to this album for a while now and it is awesome . i think it is a must have for any metal fan , you just have to listen to it from start to finish to understand it . this is just a great album .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
1	i do not know if i wa surprised or not , but i did find this album at a music store near me . yes , it is not the highest quality music , but it is a good start . very well recorded , and the musicianship is excellent , with a nice balance of instrument . i would say that this album is not a good a the first one , but certainly not a bad a some others i have heard .
0	this is a very impressive set of song . it is great to hear this many different artist and band coming together to make one album . the music is very tight and is very well sung . i just wish i could get my hand on some of the other song on the cd .
0	this album ha a new sound/style . i love the new sound , the new song . i do not know why the old song are so popular . i think it ha to do with the lone wolf feeling of the lone wolf sound . i would have preferred a more lone wolf sounding album , but i think they nailed the sound . i listened to the first 3 and then went to the next . my opinion of this is that it is nice , and will grow on you . not great , but nice . i love the new song on this album , but my favorite song is on the original cd . and , i love the new cd .
1	this song ha a powerful message .
1	the album by mr. t is really good . i like it . it ha a very good song list on it .
1	i have had this on repeat for most of the day . i love this song !
1	this is an excellent album . the cd sound perfect , and the performance is perfect . i had trouble hearing many of the song , but i wa able to hear them . i have been a fan of this band for a long time , and this cd is the best i have ever heard .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	this album not bad , but nothing special .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	i love this movie .
1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
1	this cd is great . i love the cd and the instrument are great . the lyric are easy to
0	i can not say enough good thing about the album . i have never been a big fan of eminem but after listening to this album i realized i am not a fan of eminem at all .
0	i wa disappointed in this cd . no song that i like . i have to say i like the lyric , but the music is no good .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	i bought this album in 2001 and it is by far the worst album that i have ever purchased . the album is filled with boring and boring lyric . the album is filled with no talent and no talent . bluegrass is a word that i have forgotten , but the bluegrass band that i listened to in 2001 were not bluegrass band . they were country band . i thought that there wa more music in the world than bluegrass and the new grass revival wa just too much of an embarrassment to the world , even though i understand that there are still people out there that like bluegrass . this album wa released on an independent label and is a very poor release .
0	i give a lot of album 5/4 because i love them all .
1	excellent song .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	this is a good song . it is not a song to be listened to over and over again . if you like it , buy it . if you do not like it , do not . that is my opinion . i have bought several copy of this song .
0	i bought this album because i have this cd in my car . i love it . i want to own all their album . i want to own all their album .
0	i found this cd very relaxing . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to relax , this is for everyone and it will be good for any age .
1	this album ha great song and
1	the best eminem album .
1	a really great song .
0	i have not listened to this album yet , but i am going to do so very soon . i listened to it and it wa really good , but i noticed that the sample wa used in the song i wan na borrow your face which i thought wa just weird . i thought it wa a good album , but i just thought it needed a little more imagination , and not using a sample .
0	the quality is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so good !
1	i love the song , i like the production , i like the music . i like the song , i like the production , i like the music . i love the song , i like the production , i like the music , i like the song , i like the production , i like the music , i love the song , i like the production , i like the music .

0	i am not a fan of eminem . i do not like his rap . i do not like his music . never have . never will . i do not listen to him .
1	i have not heard many rock and roll album that have the quality that this one doe . i have not heard music that make me feel a alive and passionate a this one doe . many of the selection are really good . this is a great album . the first thing that popped into my mind when i heard this album wa the name of the band , the knack .
1	i bought all the cd , it wa worth the price !
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	i have been a fan of this band since i first saw them in the mid-80s and have been a fan ever since . the music is all there , with no surprise or deviation from the original . i love this band . the music never fails to surprise me . they make a great live band a well . the best way to describe this band music is to say it is blue .
1	i love eminem ! i wa so excited to hear eminem on my birthday , but i do not think i wa prepared for the emotion that this album brings . i love the way it sound , i like the beat and it is a great representation of eminem .
1	one of my favorite album of all time is the goodness of god . there is a certain beauty and wisdom in the lyric that i find very appealing and the music is excellent . the lyric are very deep and well thought out and the music is top notch . i believe this album will be one of the most popular and influential album of all time and i hope that many people who love heavy metal will buy it .
1	this song wa what i wa listening to when my husband and i were on a road trip from missouri to texas . we got the cd at a rest stop . it wa a hit and i still have it . it is a great song .
0	[ it is only 2 song on this one . the rest is eminem . ]
1	i find this song very relaxing . i like the sound of the guitar and i like the sound and the feel of the bass . the song is very pleasant to listen to .
1	i have been listening to this album since the beginning of time and i really like it . there are only a few song that stand out to me , but they are all great .
1	the song is very positive , especially to the young generation . it show how the world is changing every day , and you should live that way .
0	great song !
0	so all of my friend say that i am the best person to buy their album , but i know that this album will not last , at all . this album ha two song that i really like , but they are not on there . the song me against me and little green men . the song i can not handle you is a great song but it is not on there . the song so is a song i know that i will not like . the song breakdown is a song i know that i will not like . the song i can not hold you and girlfriend are song i know that i will not like . this is the worst album i have ever heard .
0	the album is excellent . i would buy it again , but i do not want to buy it again .
0	this is not my favorite song . this is my least favorite song .
0	the opening of the second movement is sooooo much better than the opening of the third .
0	it is good ! i like the music and the artwork . it is not a good album .
0	i think that this is a really good song . i think that it is a good song .
0	this cd should not be listened to at all . the music is repetitive and boring . i do not like this music . i feel that the choral leader is not very good . i would have preferred to have had music that wa more interesting .
1	i bought a cd for my sister , she loved it .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	this is one of my favorite album of all time . i have always loved the song on this cd . i would rate it a c+ .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	the only reason i purchased this cd is because of the review on it and the fact that it wa the first album i ever purchased . not a bad purchase , but not one of my favorite .
1	this album is amazing . i love it .
1	i saw this band on a local show and i wa amazed . i liked them right away . their music is different then alot of other band out there . their sound are different then alot of other band out there . this band is great ! keep up the great work guy !
0	this cd is a nice compilation of great music . i like the variety of sound .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	schubert music is really beautiful and unique . very , very enjoyable !
1	this is a great song . it is a beautiful song to sing during a wedding , especially if it is played at the beginning of the ceremony .
1	eminem is awesome .
1	i love this song . i think it is so great . i have no doubt that it is the best song ever written .
0	this is the second album from the band that wa started by three of my best friend . i have heard only one of their first three album and i am not really a fan . but this is a good album . the song are good , and most of them are good . the production is good . i am not really a fan , but i am a sucker for good music . i have tried , and i bought this , and i am not really a fan . i am not really a fan , but i am a sucker . i have tried , and i bought this , and i am now a fan .
0	i am a big fan of the band and i have a lot of their stuff on amazon .
0	a lot of people do not realize that there are actually two version of the boy is mine . the first one is the one they put on the album , while the one they did in concert is completely different . the cd version is a little better than the live version , because the performance he gave in concert wa a little more authentic but not enough to make the cd version superior to the concert version . i would say that the cd version is better than the live version if you are a fan of the original version .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	this is a very nice song for meditation and relaxation . good for stress .
1	i love the

0	i bought this record a while ago and found it to be very good . i really like this record . all the song on it are good . i like how the song are arranged , like they are strung together and not just random song . the band doe a great job with this cd .
0	this wa a really good listening experience . the whole album is great , but this is where it took a dive . i really hope they put out another disc soon .
0	i bought this album for my kid just to listen to , but it wa nice to finally find a classical album that i like . i am glad i found it , but it is just not worth it . it is a good album , but not worth the money . i thought i would like it , but it just wasnt worth it .
1	i bought this because of the name . it actually made me laugh out loud . i just wanted to hear the rest of the album .
0	i bought this cd because i liked the music . i liked the name of the song , so i figured that i would enjoy it . i did not like this cd . it ha nothing that i would call good about it . i will give it a try , but i will not buy it again .
0	this is a great album . i would rate it a a 7/10 . nothing is wrong with it . the only problem is that it is 4 disc . i would like to have had the original 3 disc . i do not know if i will get the 3rd one . after this one , i might have to look for a copy of the first one i had .
1	i really like this album . it is got a great mix of traditional and modern western swing song , and they are all great . the album is very well done . the album can easily be listened to over and over .
1	i really liked this song . it wa the first song i learned ( i think ) to play on a piano and it took me awhile to get the hang of it ( but i did ) . i think this song ha a lot of potential . although the song is not a comedy song , i think it would make an excellent song for a rock band . the guitar solo is very cool .
0	this is a really bad song . i do not mean to sound like a broken record , but i have been listening to this song for over 30 minute and i still do not get what they are saying . the music is pretty good , but the lyric are horrible , and i just can not figure out what they are talking about .
0	i had the privilege of trying this cd . it is a wonderful collection of the finest smooth jazz . all of the best artist come together to make a wonderful album .

1	this is a great album ! i first heard it on the radio and immediately purchased it from the discography . it is a great collection of song from the 60 , 70 and 80 . i have listened to it twice and both time it wa great . it is a great addition to your collection .
0	the only reason i can say anything bad about this album is that it is my least favorite . i think the song are great and the sound quality is not something you expect to hear on a cd .
0	i liked the cd , but i think it should be longer .
1	i love this album ! it show that holm is one of the best in the world . i wa very impressed with the first listen . the music is very smooth , ha a great feel to it and holm ha a great voice . i am also impressed with the variety on the album . there are many different style and instrumentals on the album which make me love the collection even more . a must for any smooth jazz lover !
0	i love the cd , it is a lot better than her cd before it . i do not like that people can buy it for only 99 cent and listen to it all the way through without paying anything . how can you be that cheap and pay le for a cd than a movie ticket ?

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i think you are right about this album . i think this is a great blend of genre . they are not all metal , but it is all different and unique . there is not a bad song on the record . i really like the sound .

0	i like this album , but i have to admit i wa not a fan of it . i did not hear too many great song on the album that i think i would like to listen to . but i did like a couple . they were not my favorite song , but i did like them . i do not have a problem listening to any of the song in this album and i would like to listen to them again . i just wish there were more song that i would like to listen to .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
0	this is not a great song .
0	it is a good collection of song that i enjoy , and it serf a a good introduction . unfortunately , for me , it is not the best song i have ever heard . if you like schubert , and you want to learn his music , this is a good cd . it ha four cd worth of music , each with a different style , ranging from piano , violin , and voice piece , to work for voice and piano .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	i love this cd , i just purchased it for my friend . he life a distance away so i thought he would like it .
0	i love the music on this album . it is great .
0	this is good , but not great .
1	this is a great worship song . this is a great song for church . this is a great song for church music . the word are powerful . this is a great song . this is a great song for a worship service . this is a great song for a church service .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	i love this song ! it is the perfect playlist for the holiday !
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	this is a very touching album . the message are so powerful . this is a very touching album . the message are so powerful . the
1	i like this song , but i find the lyric and video to be boring .
0	the voice is nothing special . the sound is ok but not spectacular . the lyric are too easy to understand . the melody is not my favorite . the song is just plain boring .
0	another good album by eminem . i bought the clean version . it is not bad . it is one of his better album . i like the song and i like the lyric . i like the album , but i do not like the song . this is the 2nd album i bought by him . i like the song and i like the album .

1	this is not my first cd . it is a good cd .
0	this is so bad it is worse than the worst thing i have ever heard .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
0	this album doe not have a single bad song , but there are just not enough song . the song are very good but there are just not enough to fill the song for a cd .
1	one of the best of the genre . the sound quality is great ; the playing is impeccable . the sound is crisp and detailed .
0	after listening to the cd , i have decided to not buy it .
1	i had waited to buy this one for almost a year . after i saw the release date , i rushed to get a copy . i wa excited to listen to this album because i wanted to see if this album wa better than r. kelly love letter which i liked but i wasnt sure if i liked love letter more than this one
1	i listened this album on my drive to work . the first song i put on list ha to
0	this is a great album . i love the sound of the cd , but i do not like how they edited their version of billy gibbon the way i am to make it sound more like a rap song . i thought it wa a great song to be sung in a bluesy type of voice , and i love the way they did that with it . i do not necessarily think it should be changed , but i do not think it should have been done . it should not be changed because it is billy gibbon singing it , but it is not exactly how he sang it . the other thing that disappointed me is the fact that it got a little more aggressive . i understand it is a rap song , but the way they edited it to sound more like one is not cool . that is why i do not like this album . i am not saying you can not like this cd , but there is something about it that doe not sit right with me .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	there is no need to get into the technical aspect of this review , but the bottom line is this album doe not work . they are just not a good musician . the song are good , but they are just not good enough to be considered great . the cd go from sounding like a bunch of guy singing random song from a bad radio show to sounding like a bunch of guy singing the same song over and over again , over and over again . the cd suffers from the same problem that their previous cd did , they go from good tune to mediocre tune . i am not going to say it is their worst cd ever , because i do not think it is , but i have nothing to say about it .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	this album is the best .
1	this is a really good album . the intro one more time is the best on the album . the second song in the album is take one which ha some great rap and beat . there is also another great song called lonely which is very good .
0	i am definitely going to re-order this cd . the music is great . i have spent thousand of dollar on music that is crap .
0	this song wa really good . i like the guitar .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .

1	i am really enjoying this cd , and i think i am going to buy the entire album . i thought i knew all the song on the cd , but now i realize i had never heard one of them before . i have heard a lot of song on this cd that i may have only heard on the radio , but many of them i have never heard before . i love the song i love you by the beatles because it hit you over the head with a great message and it is just an awesome song . i am sorry by the beatles is awesome . i like the song just a little bit because it just a great tune . the greatest love of all is just a great song . i like the song i have got a problem by the beatles because it a great song and well sung . the song you are not alone by the beatles is awesome . i like the song funny boy because it hit you over the head with a great message . i like the song in my dream because it hit you over the head and it is a little creepy . i like the song i have got a problem because it hit you over the head and it is a little creepy and it ha a great message . a time for love ha a great message and it is a little creepy . i love the music i have heard so far and will continue to buy the album .

1	this is a great collection of song . a very nice compilation of song . the lonestar kid is my favorite album . it is a good one , but the loneys loneys is a real gem of a record .
1	this song ha always been a classic . it is a great song to use for wedding or other special event . i find it quite romantic , especially the chorus .

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	i am sorry but i have to disagree with your review . i have always loved hall and oat music and this is a great album . they are extremely entertaining and they are very much on my list of favorite artist . i think it is very important to have a band that you can call your own when you are growing up . i grew up listening to the beatles and they have always been very important to me . i have always wanted to be a singer , but i am not sure if i will ever pursue it . i have tried with a few other artist and they did not seem to be a good a the beatles . i guess i am just waiting for the right artist or band to come along . it will be interesting to see what happens .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	just the thought of hearing one of these song is enough to make me cry . even the thought of seeing these song on your local radio station make me cry . these are some of my favorite song . why can not you hear them anymore ? it is a shame . it is a shame that meghan trainor ha decided to write song that are not good enough to be heard by anyone listening to you or me . if this song is in your amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at least not enough to buy another copy of it .

0	this is a terrible album . all the song on the album are about rap and this album doe not have much at all to do with rap . the song , while they have some good beat , are so dull and unoriginal that they are not worth listening to . the majority of the song are about rap and the music is lacking in any originality . i would not recommend this album to anyone who like rap .

1	i would like to hear the original lp and i am glad that i am not the only one that think so . i have listened to this album a couple of time and i am very impressed with the sound . i like the album but i do not think it is the best of his career . this is the best album i have ever heard .

1	i have been listening to robert johnson song for about 40 year . i wa really surprised to hear that he died .
0	i had to stop this cd because it wa all i could listen to . the song were so bad , the lyric were terrible , the production wa poor , and the vocal were so bad , i could not listen to it . this cd is truly a waste .
0	i have listened to this album several time , and each time i am more impressed with it depth and complexity than the first time . it is difficult to describe the music , but i would venture to say it is perhaps the best heavy metal album ever recorded . it is a truly wonderful album .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	great album , the song are good , they are a little different than her pop/rock song , but they are very catchy . i only hope that she will continue to sing this type of musical genre . i liked the musical genre because she sang about the love of her life . i also like the fact that she sings about the love of the world . i like that she sings about these topic . i am glad that i bought this album .

0	this is a very good album . it is not a well done and polished a some of the other release on this site . it is not an overwhelming album but it is a good representation of the band .

0	this album is good in a sense that it is better than some other major hip-hop album . in all honesty , i do not think that it is a better album than most other major hip-hop album . they do not sound like they should . the only reason they are worth a purchase is because of a few song . i think that the album overall is a waste of $ 3.99 . the only reason i am not giving this a zero is because it is not a bad album . the worst album of the year . i give it 2. i am not a fan of this group . i think that they sound generic . the only thing that really stand out is hoe down on my homies . i feel like that song is a little bit off the wall . there may be a few hit here and there but there is not a lot of them . if you like to listen to music and are looking for a hip-hop album , then do not bother . this album is not worth your time .

1	i found this album to be a really nice album . i like the lyric and it ha a nice mellowness to it . the singer , bob will doe not have the best voice , but it is not bad .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i really like this band . but i have to say i am not a fan of traditional christmas music . i am a die-hard fan of the oldies/classic rock/oldies/classic rock music . i think some of the music is very well done ( like them on the cd and the spirit of christmas on the dvd ) . however , i think a lot of the christmas music is just meh ( in term of quality ) . i know this is just my opinion , but i just do not get it . i do not understand what they are trying to convey . i just do not like it . but i do like the cd and dvd . their cd is just all of the best song they can play . the dvd is a little more generic , but still good ( just not my style ) .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	this is my first christian album and i love it !
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	i really love this album . it ha very good music .
1	fantastic .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .

0	great vocal without any harshness , just a nice smooth sound .
0	the first cd of this album is a collection of schubert lied - very enjoyable . the second cd is his chamber work - which is more enjoyable . the cd of the lied is all of the song on the album . i would like to hear more of the lied . i wa disappointed that schubert music wa not recorded in the same setting that he would be performing . i would have preferred to hear the song recorded in a concert hall . i would have preferred to hear more of the lied . i have not yet heard the third cd , but i will review it when i do .
1	this is a very nice song . it is one of the few song i will listen to when i want to relax and get away from life . it is nice to hear that you can still sing when you are older .

1	i really like the first album . it wa good . the only problem is that the song are really bad . it is really hard to listen to the song without the music . i do not know why , but i am really disappointed .
1	the song do not stop is not a typical rap song . it is a song about a love triangle between a man , a woman and a cop . the lyric are about the sexual encounter that they have with each other . they are at the point where they are no longer just friend , but lover . it is not a sexual song , it is a sexual confession . do not stop is the only song on this album that can be considered a rap song . it is about the love triangle and the sexual encounter that they have .
1	i have listened to this song many time and i would not listen to this song if i did not love eminem and hall and oat .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	this
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	this is a good listen , i just wish they could have kept the clean version out . i do not mind the song , but the clean version is better . i am gon na give it a few spin .
0	this song wasnt terrible , but it just did not grab me .
0	the original version of this song wa just a little too fast . i think it wa played too fast . it sounded like it wa playing all the note at the same time . but , the guitar player , bob johnson , kept it together and made it sound like he wa playing the song , in the middle of the song . it wa pretty cool .
0	this cd is awesome ! it is not that long ! i like the song , but i would not call it christian music . i would give it 4 star and recommend it to anyone who want to hear christian music .
0	this is one of the strongest debut album of all time . this album is definitely not for everyone , but for those who love alternative music , this is a must have .
1	i have been listening to this album for year . i think it is the best cd i have ever had in my collection . the only thing that would improve it would be a little more instrumentation .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	i bought these because i loved the way the man sings . this song is a must own for everyone !
0	not a bad album , but i am not really in the mood for it . i am waiting for it to be re-released .
0	i like what i hear .
1	i purchased this cd primarily to help me discover an instrument i have wanted to play for a very long time . this cd contains one of my all time favorite song , i will be there for you and when i fall in love . i found it quite difficult to sing a song with complete lyric , so i decided to listen to the song with the music playing and put the lyric to the song on my own . i found that the song came to life when i listened to it with the lyric on , and i really enjoy singing this song . i found the performance more meaningful when i did not have the lyric , and i wa able to feel the song come to life .
1	so i have actually listened to this song for about a week now , i listen to it every day . it is a good song . i just do not like it .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	this is a wonderful album . i have never been so impressed by any album in my life . the song selection is superb and the vocal performance are top notch . the best thing about this album is that it is so beautifully produced . the quality of the recording is second to none . it is worth every penny spent on it .
1	the band is definitely underrated . they are great live and just seem to have a sense of style and rhythm that make them stand out from the other band in the genre . i have always enjoyed the music of this band and i am happy to have discovered them . i would also like to see them live again .
1	it is unfortunate that this album wa not recorded in stereo . the album wa recorded in stereo . that being said , the album is very good .
0	i am not sure what to say . i love his music , and his other album are excellent . some song are better than others .
1	this album reminds me of the cure .
0	did not really live up to expectation .
0	the only thing is that these guy are not your usual country rocker . it is a mixed bag of different style and i like a bit of all of them . this is not a country band , it is a diverse band . the sound is not country , it is not rock , it is a combination of western , folk , and rock .
0	i really enjoy the song on this album , but the chorus is just too much for me . the vocal and instrumentation are very good , and the song are very well produced . some would say this is hip-hop , but it is more like alternative/indie rap . i like it . i will purchase more cd by this artist .
0	the new cd is good . it had some good song on it . i think she is still a great singer . i am glad she is moving forward with her music . i am glad she is writing her own song . i can not stand the lyric of most of her song . i have never really listened to her music . i think the new song are good . i do not think they are all bad . i really like the new song . i think they are all good . the new song are better than the old song . i still love the old song . i have not listened to the old song in a while . i think i am ready to listen to the new song . i am looking forward to it . i am glad she is still writing her own song . i am glad she is still writing her own song .

1	wow , what a great idea for a book ! this is a great book to have and to read !
1	this is a very good tune and one of my favorite . it is so good that i have made it into a ringtone .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	i purchased this because it wa on my to buy list . i love this song . i have had it for year and it is my all time fav .
0	this is a really good album , but i do not like it . i like eminems music , but i do not like the cd . i do not think it is a good a the previous cd . i do not think it is a good a the eminem show . i think this album is too short . i only listened to it for an hour . i could listen to the cd much longer . i do not think this cd is worth the $ 2.99 .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i feel this is a very inspirational christmas cd . i love all the song . it ha music that is very festive and happy . the lyric are very thought provoking and meaningful . it is recommended to anyone who like inspirational christmas music .
0	i like and this song .
1	this is a fun song , but i wish there wa a bit more of it .
1	i like this album a lot . the music is great . i like that the vocal are deep and powerful . the lyric are intelligent and funny . the production is great . this album is a must have for me . it is a good album . i recommend it .
0	i bought this cd ( and i will be buying the second cd ) so i could listen to it over and over again and not get sick of it . i have enjoyed listening to this cd . but it is not the same a listening to meghan trainors previous album . i will try to listen to this cd more , but i do not think i will enjoy the full effect of it . it is not bad , but it is not meghan trainors best , either .
0	this album is a good album . i like the song . i like the production and the lyric .
0	this is definitely one of my favorite album . the music is very well done . i really love this album . the only problem is that the song are scratched all the way through .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i found this album to be very annoying and a waste of money
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	schubert wa a composer who wa known for his mastery of the written work .
0	i really thought the album wa nice . it wasnt anything special , but i enjoyed listening to it .
1	i like it ! the lyric are kind of silly and the guitar playing is a bit clunky , but the singing is great !
1	this is not my first cd , but it will be my last . i am very grateful that i can sing the song . it is so simple . i would love to sing with others .
1	this is the kind of cd i would recommend to others . i have been listening to this cd for a week and a half now . there are many great thing here . i would definitely recommend this cd to others . i like the choir and the music . i thought that the recording quality wa very good . i love the way it is recorded . this is a good collection of choral piece . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like choral piece .
0	it is a good album , but i do not like this cd a much a some of the others i have had in the past . i still like it . the only reason i do not like it is because of the fact that it is a little bit boring , which mean it tends to get boring around the middle . also , it doe not contain much good music in it . i only have a few song that i like .
0	the best live concert i have ever heard . i have heard other live cd , but none of them compare to this one . it is the best live cd i have ever heard . it is the best live concert i have ever heard .
0	i have a hard time describing this cd . it is a very enjoyable album to listen to . the music is beautiful and the vocal are very good . when i listened to the entire disc , i wondered how i could purchase two disc . i wa very happy to find that i could purchase two cd with this set . i am a big fan of the opera turandot and this cd contains a good amount of it . i hope that i can get the entire opera when i start to learn it .
1	this album wa absolutely stunning , and i thought it wa worth the money .
1	i like r kelly voice , i love the cd , and i like the song .
1	i wish i could give this a positive review but it is true . i got this a a free download . it is a very sad song . robert johnson is a legend and wa one of the greatest bluesmen in the world . he wa a poet , a songwriter , an actor , a dancer , and a painter . i have seen his movie and read his book . his voice sound like it come off of a big old oak tree . his song it doe not matter is one of the greatest song i have ever heard . i am glad i got this song .
1	i think the lyric of this song are very sweet .
1	i love this cd ! this cd changed my life . it really doe . i listened to it for the first time about a month ago . the only problem i have is that i can not listen to it all the way through . i would have to listen to it once again to even get the full enjoyment out of it . i feel like the singing is really good . i feel like i heard some pretty good voice in the choir . i wish i could hear more on the cd . i have a hard time remembering the music because i am so excited to get to listen to this cd again . i also wish that the cd had a little more variety in the song . i really like that there are some classical piece mixed in with the contemporary piece . to me , it sound like a really good combination of classical and contemporary music . the music is also very easy to sing along with . i would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys contemporary and classical music .
1	this group is a good band , but their tune are rather off ( not to say there are not good song out there ) . they always seem to be singing four identical chord over and over , in a strange order , which make it hard to keep track of what they are singing . the music seems to be trying to emulate a string quartet , or perhaps a small band in a small nightclub . the singing is great , but the song are just not very distinctive . this band is from new york , so i assume they play a lot of off music at night . the band is very well-dressed for a tour band , and they are all very polite .
1	this is a great choice . i really like this cd .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
0	i liked this album , but my family just did not .
0	wow , this is great . it is like hearing jimi hendrix for the first time , but at the same time you can hear the beatles in the background .
0	a a fan of western music , i purchased this cd . it is very good . it is also very good for the price .
1	this cd is absolutely wonderful ! it ha a very good quality sound and it is very inspirational . i really love this cd . i would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for some new and interesting musical material to listen to .

1	this cd is fantastic !
1	i bought this album on my birthday , and wa very happy with it . i wa very impressed with the number of good song and the variety of good song . i think that if you need an instant album to get you through a very busy day , this is the album for you .
0	meh- the lead actor wa excellent and i thought the music wa great .
0	i have listened to this song on and off for year . it is good . i like the music , but the lyric are terrible and do not even compare to any of the other song on this album . i really like the music , but i am disappointed in the lyric . i love all the song on the album , but i just can not seem to get into any of the song .
0	this is an amazing album . i am a huge bob will fan and this album is just a good .
1	i love south pacific . i would like to see it on broadway .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
1	i bought this cd a few year after the original performance . i did listen to the cd twice because i wanted to know for sure if the original cast recording wa actually the same a the recording on this cd . the original cast recording is actually a few year older than this cd , and in the original recording the music on the cd wa played by the original cast member , but in this recording they played the music by themselves . the two recording are not in close synchronization with each other , but i would have no problem believing the original cast recording wa the same a the performance on this cd . i do believe the second cd is a good representation of the song .
0	this wa a good cd but it did not stop me from buying it . i would recomend it to a friend .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i have been listening to your album for 20 year and i always enjoy them . i agree with you , i would like to recommend your music to anyone .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
0	eminem make great song , but his lyric and delivery are weak , and he is not very creative , so i would recommend avoiding lose yourself if you want to be entertained and have a good time .

1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
1	i wa excited for this cd to
1	i love the sound of this cd .
1	this song is great .
0	this cd is a waste of money . it is just not worth it . the music is bad . i do not know who this singer is . i don ; t know what this album is . all the song suck . it is not worth it . i do not know why this cd wa put out . i do not know if i should buy it . why did this cd have to have song like this , that are so bad . i do not like this cd . i do not know why this album wa released . it is not worth it . this cd wa not worth buying .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .

1	i absolutely love this song . it is a great song . i love it .
1	great album ! i have only one complaint : the song title are too small . i wish they were larger .
1	i have listened to the first cd twice over and i have to say , i like it better than the second cd . i do not know why . i have to say though that i have a lot of respect for eminem . he is an amazing singer/songwriter and i think he had a great career . the only thing i do not like so much about this album is that it is so long . i wish it wasnt that long . i have to say though that i like this album a lot . it is not that amazing , but it is not that bad .
0	this is such a fun song . it is got a great message and a great message . i love the way the music flow and the way it make you feel when you listen to it .
1	that wa way better than the original .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	i love this song . i love meghan trainor . she is so talented . she writes great song . i need to buy her next album . i will give this song 5 star .
1	this is very nice ! it is a great song and a very good choice !
1	this cd ha great song . they have a good mix of genre and their song are very good .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	i have been wanting to buy this album for a long time . i do not mind the song but the message is just wrong . i am not even going to look at the album .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a cry to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart , to the shout of your faith .
0	this song get me every time i listen to it .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
0	after hearing libera song on my internet radio , i wa very impressed . i thought that the boy had an extraordinary voice and had an interesting sound to them . however , after listening to the entire cd , i wa disappointed .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	i would like to put this song on a cd of song i have not heard yet .
1	this cd
1	this is my go-to for the holiday . it is just so wonderful !
1	this is a nice pop-rock album and i am sure that every man and woman need a good pop-rock album every once in a while . i am sure there is a few woman who also enjoy this genre . the album is well-produced and produced by the band itself and the best thing is that it is well worth listening to . i wa surprised with the first couple song on the album . i am sure there are more , but i have not listened to them yet .
0	this album doe not have a single bad song on it . it ha a lot of different style , but each one is good . i am glad i made the purchase , because it turned out to be a great purchase . i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	this is a good song but the chorus is a bit of a letdown . i can not stand the fact that he shout the word i am a motherfucking star , motherfucking star in the chorus over and over again . i can not help but think that he sound like a star because he is a star . the production is the same a on the previous song . there is nothing that make this song stand out except the chorus which really make it stand out . i find it hard to listen to this song on the radio and i find it hard to listen to this song on the stereo .
0	i do not know what it is about this group , but i simply adore them . this is a group that ha some of the best musician i know in it . the group is so smooth and ha incredible musicianship . the playing is so smooth and beautiful . and they are all so lovely . i love to watch these guy and listen to them . i would love to see this group on stage with their own band . i would love to see them with a guitar player like eric clapton or david gilmour . i think we could have a night to remember . it is very exciting listening to them play .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	i have been a fan of the band since the 80 . i think they are pretty good , except for some song on this cd . the song on this cd are pretty good , but i would not call it my favorite . i had to skip some song because they were too similar to the song on the cd i already had . the song all is lost is pretty good , but the other song did not appeal to me . i am glad i got this cd , but i will not be listening to it again .
0	i think this is a very good song . i do not think it is a good cover .
1	this song ha always been my favorite song to sing at the top of my lung , i really love the word to this song , it is one of my favorite song of all time . i would have loved to have written this song but i never really know who wrote the song . i will always have this song with me and i will always love singing this song at the top of my lung .
1	this song will bring a tear to your eye . i wish i had one of these song to play at my wedding .
0	the song on the new album are better . i do not know why some reviewer say they are stupid . they do not have a bad song on the album . they just do not like his music .
0	he is excellent . he sings great in spanish , he sings it well in english , and he sings it well in french . he is excellent . he sings great in italian , he sings it well , he sings it well , and he doe not sing in spanish . he is excellent . he sings great in german , he sings it well , he sings it well , and he doe sing in spanish .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	this is not a bad album . it is actually pretty good .
1	i have enjoyed the four sister for year . i am so glad to have found them again . it is so great to see them together .
0	i have listened to her music several time and it is quite good . she ha a great voice and i just enjoy listening to her . i like to listen to her old song a well .
0	i thought i would give this a shot . it wasnt anything special , i did not think . i liked the album , but i do not think it wa anything special .
1	this band is so fresh and original . they are different from all the other band that i have heard . i wish they had more album . i wish they would release a dvd with all their music and video . i hope they keep doing what they are doing .
1	i love all the song . but i do not get the song on the cd .
0	twiztids the best
1	this song is cool , but the vocal are the best part , and the guitar work really good too .
1	[ ray bensons voice ] this is a very good cd . the band sound great , and ray benson sings well .
0	i bought 2 copy of this album . both of them came with cd . one wa a clean copy and the other wa an all-digital copy . overall it wa ok. i wasnt blown away .
1	this song will make you feel like a woman . itll make you feel like a man .
0	i have already given a positive review of let the worshiper arise by libera . the song on this cd are quite the different than liberas sound . most of the song are in a more upbeat tempo and have a more upbeat feel to them . the song let the worshiper arise and aint no sunshine are my favorite on this cd .
0	i have really enjoyed this album .
0	i really liked this album . i thought it wa very good .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	good song , good song
1	a very good song . it is easy on the ear , and the lyric are very interesting .

1	i love the song and the song is very good .
0	i think they are a nice band and i got into them before i heard them . they have a fresh sound . they have a good rhythm section and a lead section . i think they have a good future . but they are not for me . i think they need to get a little more popular to get better record . i like the song but i do not think they are going to be a major hit .

0	the cd ha a nice cover with a great band , and a great album . i have bought a couple of cd from this band , and they have been very good to me . i am happy with these cd i have so far . i hope more cd come out from this band . i hope to see them on the stage and i would like to see them perform more often .
0	i bought the cd and listened to it first off . i wa really disappointed . i got it off amazon.com and i do not think the song are good . i do not think they are good . i like some of the song on this cd , but i just do not think they are good . i like my guy and dance with me and new york to tokyo , but they are boring song for me .
0	i really like this song to listen to while i am doing my yoga exercise . i like the word , and the music really help me . this is a good song to listen to in the morning .

0	i tried to go on amazon and see if i could buy the full score of this opera but the price wa too high for my budget . i have been in the christian music industry for a very long time now . i have to say that i have never seen a cd that ha a full score on it . i guess i will be satisfied with this cd because it is a good cd , but , i have to say that i am disappointed in the price of this cd . i really do not know what else to say . i guess i will just have to wait and see what happens .
1	the cd wa great ! the sound wa great and the band wa great ! i am a big jazz fan and i really liked the cd .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	ray ha a great voice and i love the arrangement of his song . awesome voice and great arrangement . i love this album .
1	this is by far one of the best christian pop album i have ever heard . jewel is a young singer who ha been around for awhile and ha some amazing song . the song are just so catchy , and she is in a great place in her career . she ha a great voice , and her lyric are so deep and meaningful !
0	this song is a beautiful ballad , but the lyric are not too long and it is a little simple .
1	i have always liked the band and the song and this is a great album to have on hand .
0	i do not know what i would do without amazon.com . if i had any other online store it would be all gone .
0	i can not really say anything . i am not that much of a musician . but i really like this album . this album is worth it .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	this one i did not like . it wa one of his lesser work , but still , it wa good .
1	i have been a fan of both album by this band for year . i think this album is the best one yet . the song on this album are good , but it is the music that really make this album , and it really make this album stand out . i love the music on this album , and i love the people who made this album . it is not a good album , but it is a very good one . i highly recommend this album to everyone .
1	this is one of my favorite . it is like an ode to music , it is like what i would want to hear if i could make it . i just bought this song ( because of the review ) and the song is great .
1	a song about a man who want to be free and free from the world and the people in it .
0	there is no real difference in the sound . it ha the same kind of sound . the vocal are about the same . it is the song selection that is different . there are no real song on this cd . i am not a big fan of this guy . he is not my favorite singer .
0	this is an excellent album . the song are all very good , and the harmony are very good . the only problem with this cd is that the song are all very short .
1	i think this is the best of the three . i like the song do you believe in santa claus ? and i like the way it is and i will walk away the best .
1	this is a good song .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	this is my first album and i like it .

0	the only cd i have used that i have not liked is smooth jazz from smooth jazz production . it just did not have any good music .
1	this song would make a great party theme song . the lyric are really cool and the music is fun , but i think this song would be a better song if it wa longer .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .

1	i think this song is good . the lyric are good . the song is okay . i do not know the meaning of the song though . i like it . i can not believe it is only one song .
0	the first song and second song were very similar . they both have very slow and sad vocal , but the first one is more memorable because it ha lyric and the second one doe not . other than the first song , this album is average . i would give this album a 4.5.5
1	this album is better than the first one . i think that is what i wa telling you , this is the 4th time i have listened to it it is so different than the slim shady lp . eminem ha a way of making song pop out of nowhere and i really like this album . i do not think you can compare it to title because it wa such a slow build up to this album , this album is really good . i think i am going to buy it again !

1	he need a better voice . he is too low and it is not like he is singing along with the beat , he is just singing a few bar , which make his voice seem smaller and weaker . the only positive thing i can say about this song is that it sound like it could be fun if you actually listened to it .

1	i absolutely love this song !

1	a very nice selection of classical music . # 1
0	this album is pretty good , but the lyric and the voice are annoying . they are not sung well at all . you can tell that these guy did not go to a singing school or anything . so they need to get to a good singing school . the songwriting is not good . the lyric are just plain stupid . the vocal harmony are just plain stupid . the music is just plain stupid . the production is just plain stupid .

0	music is horrible ! it is so boring , it is so generic , it is so overused . it sound like a crappy rock song that wa stuck on a cd . i do not know why they think people will want to listen to that stuff . there is nothing about the song that relates to the movie ( which is so dull ) . i wa thinking about buying this , but i think that i will just leave it on my shelf .

0	i liked this cd , but i do not think i would buy again .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !

0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

1	i have been buying this cd for my son off and on since 1997. he listens to it every time he is at his parent home . he love it . the only cd i have ever liked better than this one wa the cd by the same name that wa released in 1999. i would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys old school music .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

1	i love hall and oates ! i know one of the song is a cover of a song hall and oates covered from the 80 , so i guess it is a cover of a song by the 60 . i would buy this cd , i would buy it again and again . hall and oates is one of the greatest songwriter ever , he is so good .

1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
1	this is a great debut cd from a band i have been looking forward to for a very long time . i love the way this band ha grown in the past two year . they have a great mix of different style , but at the same time , they have stayed true to their root . this band ha a lot of potential , and it show in their music . i can not wait to hear what they do next .
0	i bought the album . i have been listening to it for a couple of week now and i love it . it is so much fun . i got the album on sale , so i could not pas it up . i think that it is a good album to start with , but i do not think that i would actually buy the album .
0	i do not like most christian music . i prefer music from more contemporary artist . however , this wa a very nice cd . it is a great mix of different style of music , which i really enjoy . the only thing i do not like about this cd is that it is a little too short .
0	this is a great cd . the song are good , but it doe not have any really good song . just some good one that you do not hear often . the cd is definately worth buying .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i have been a fan of biggie small for a number of year and this album is a joy to hear . the beat are dope and the music is fun to listen to . i wish that they would have gone with their own beat , but it is still a fun listen . a for the lyric , just take a listen to the chorus to you keep me hanging on and tell me how bad they are .
1	this cd is really cool ! the track on here are all killer , and i love the vocal . the track are all different , so you are not stuck listening to the same type of music for a while . the lyric are unique , and really interesting .
0	i do not like this cd . i will not buy it . the only redeeming quality is the music . the vocal are ok , but the melody is awful . i know that other people like this song , but i have a hard time with it . if i had the cash to afford this cd , i would buy it because it is a good song , but the price is a bit steep for what i would pay for other people cd .
0	i do not like this song . the only thing i can think of is that the singer is trying to be a tough guy . he is not being very positive in his song . it is just hard to like this song . it is just too boring for me . it is just too generic . i do not know why he is singing , but i guess it is about life , i guess it is like an average man love life . it just sound like he is singing about himself , and i just do not care for it .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

0	great cd for a christmas gift !
1	i really like this album . it just hit all the right note for me .
0	this song ha a great beat and a great melody , but i do not like it a much a the original version of the song . the original ha a wonderful melody and the chorus is so good . i think the song is cool , but it is not very good .
1	this song rock !
1	i feel that it is a great musical . the show is very well done . i saw it at the theater , and i wa amazed and moved by it . i do not think it is the best musical , but it is still a great show .
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .

0	this is a great album . the lyric are very well developed , and the musical arrangement are very good . the instrument sound very well .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	this album is not bad , it is more of the same . in fact , there are some good song on the album . i bought this album at a wal-mart in the late 1980s . i liked the first half of this cd , i liked the blue , i liked some of the song , i liked some of the song , but , the lyric are so watered down , i could not get into it . i think i will get this album on cd , i will listen to it . i will buy the cd , but , i will not buy this cd . i think this is a poor album . i do not buy this cd , i do not think this is a poor album , i will wait for the cd . i want the cd , i want the cd , i want the cd , i do not want the cd , i want the cd , i want the cd , i want the cd ,

1	i wa really looking forward to this album , and am very disappointed . i would have preferred a more cohesive album . too much filler and not enough substance . the song are very good , but have very little energy or enthusiasm . the production is extremely good , with very clear , well-defined vocal . i also love the interplay between the three member , and all three are very different . it is a very cohesive album . the only negative is the mediocre instrumental music that is over-produced and very annoying .
1	this song is for everybody that need a good tune in their life . this is a good song that you can listen to over and over and it will get you through all the day of your life . this is a good song that you can listen to over your whole life .

0	if you want to learn schubert music , this is a great place to start . the song are mostly short and the arrangement are good , but the performance are what really make this cd worth the money . a long and enjoyable listen , especially for a beginner .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	i am not sure i understand what i just heard . it sound like they were going to do a documentary on the life and time of a man who may or may not have sold his soul to the devil . i do not think it wa a documentary on the life of robert johnson , it wa a documentary on the life and time of robert johnson . or that is what he said . i think he went to the devil . i think he sold his soul to the devil . i do not know . it sounded like he sold his soul to the devil . he sold his soul to the devil . i do not know . i heard that .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	i am a new listener to your music , and i am very impressed . i would say the song are all good , but the vocal of the song are great and could really use some more work . the only song i have listened to that i have not enjoyed is i wish i had a whiskey by the kingsmen . the lyric are about a woman who is looking for a man to buy her a whiskey . it is a great tune but i feel like it could have been a lot better . great voice that is a good compliment for the music .
1	i think that madlib & dre are the greatest rapper alive today . i think that they have a special gift . i do not think that they have a bad thing to say . i think that they have a great talent . i think that they both are incredible inventor . this is a great album . i like it very much . i like the production . i like the flow . i like the beat . i like the hook . i like the flow on all of the track . i like the beat on the track that i like the most . i like the hook on the track that i like the most . i like everything on this album . i like the production on this album . i like the flow on this album .

0	i found this album to be very depressing , while having a lot of very good song . i do not like the song being so sad and depressing , while the rest of the album is full of positive song . i think the album is a little too depressing and sad . i do not really care for the song being so sad , and i do not really care for the song being so positive . i like the song being so positive , but i do not like the song being so depressing . my opinion is that these song could be much more optimistic , and the song being so positive could be a little bit more upbeat . i like the song being full of positive emotion , but the song being so sad could be a little bit more positive . i will give it a 3 out of 5 star , and i will give it a 5 out of 5 star , because i like the song being really good , and i do not like the song being so sad . the album i would give 1 out of 5 star , because the song are all depressing . i will give this album a 1 out of 5 star , because the song are all depressing .

0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	i really enjoyed the trout and i agree with others , it is a very emotional and touching piece .
1	my first cd wa great

0	i purchased this album for my daughter , but when i opened the envelope she did not even want to open it . she wa happy though and she is even telling me that she is a fan of the band .
0	the band is great , but the album is pretty boring . the band play a lot of heavy metal , but the music is just too generic and nothing exciting . the song are very short , the guitar are dull and the vocal do not add much . the album ha that old school feeling to it . i just do not know why they put so much emphasis on the old school feel . the song are not bad , but i find it hard to get into .
1	i am a singer , but i have not had the chance to sing in
0	i love the way this band sound . when i heard them in 97 i thought they were pretty talented . i did not think they would make it out of the introversion that most people on this planet ( that i know ) have . they have been struggling to make it out of the introvert world for about 15 year , and i think it is time for them to get their act together .
1	i loved this dvd . first there wa the dvd , then i bought the cd . i bought the dvd because i wa able to sing the song in the right order . i wa able to sing in the order that i learned them in . the singing instructor , cyney davis , is very good , and the song are easy to sing .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	this is the worst thing i have ever heard ! it is very annoying , it make you want to stop listening to it , and it is very annoying to listen to .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	i love robert johnson and appreciate his music , he is one of a kind . he wa a great man and a great singer . he had a great voice , he ha a great voice and his voice is beautiful .
1	he is so cool , and so easy to listen to . i loved his singing on the cd , and i love his playing . it make me feel good when he play , and when he sings it just so melodic and so soothing . a great cd . i can not wait to see him again .
0	they are definitely from the same crew .
1	i like this album .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	i love all of the song on this album .
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	clint eastwood ha a great voice . it is one of those voice that can make you cry or laugh . i do not know whether it is his voice or his acting , but this man can make you believe in the goodness of man . this is a great cd . i am glad i purchased this cd . it is a great mix of western music . it is got a great sound . it is got a great mix at the beginning of the cd . it is got an awesome mix of western song . it is got another awesome mix at the end of the cd . i love the clint eastwood music . i have always loved his movie . i have always loved his movie , but i have never been able to get over his voice . this cd is great . it wa worth buying . i am glad i purchased this cd . it ha great song . it ha a great mix . i am glad i purchased this cd . it is worth buying . i think this cd is worth buying . this is a great cd . it is worth buying . it is worth buying . this is a good cd . it is worth buying . this is a great cd . this is a good cd . this is a good cd . this is a great cd . this is a great cd . this is a good cd .
0	this is a decent song but the lyric are about a good a the chorus
1	i bought a 99 reiseback copy of this cd for 99 cent . i got it a a gift and listened to it for about an hour . it is a very good cd . it is not for everyone and i think it is not the best for everyone . i think you may have to have more than one cd before you find what you are looking for . i like the harmony on this cd . the instrumentals are nice . i like the music . i have never had a cd of classical music that ha been so much fun to listen to .
0	i am assuming this song is a cover and the author of the original wrote the song , but i do not know .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	the album is a good start for her , but the vocal are not in sync with the instrument . i do like the song , but what the hell is wrong with meghan ?
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	i bought the cd because it wa on the greatest cd you have ever bought list , and i wanted to hear the whole cd . the first song is very nice , and the second song is very nice , and the last song is very nice . i really enjoy the cd a a whole . it is a very good cd .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
1	i wa searching for a band called the dallas holms for a while . i found this site and i found the holms . i wa a fan for a while , and i never would have found them without this site .
1	i got this album for my wife for her birthday . she is so excited to listen to it . i have loved all of her song for year .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	i love the song home on the range . i have listened to this cd a lot and i really enjoy it .
0	the most important thing about this cd is that the lyric are well-written and that the melody fit the lyric .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	this song is amazing ! it is one of my favorite song .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	i am getting old and i need a lot of sleep . i can not tell you how many time i have heard this album on the radio . this is one of my favorite album of all time .
1	i love this band , they are young but they have a great sound in there . i bought their album and i really liked it .
1	i love this album and this song is one of the best song on the album .
1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	i had to stop listening to this song because it made me cry .
1	one of the best song on this album . the chorus is my favorite part of the song . the production is great . the flow of the song is good , the beat is good , the flow of the lyric is good and my favorite line is : you are my best friend , i do not want to lose you . do not ever leave me like this . the verse are good but the chorus make the song .
0	i have been listening to this song for a while now and it is just so good ! it is a fantastic song and i love it .
1	this is such a great song . i love it . it is a beautiful song .
0	i like it . the only bad song is do not stop believing . i do not like the production or it is lack of good song . the lyric are good , but the production is not . i would have preferred a song like you are the one by another artist , but this one is a nice start . i still like the song , but i do not think they are going to make wave on my radio .
0	ray is one of the most talented musician i have ever heard .
0	this song doe not always have a great flow . however , it ha some great verse and some great chorus . it is a good song .
0	they have a few really good song , but they are so overrated . i think they play really good song , but their sound is so overrated . they are too fast , and they are too much in the folk-rock vibe . i do not think they are any good , but i would buy them again to see if they do anything different than what i have heard .
1	this is an excellent collection of music ! the singer are amazing ! i really enjoy the music here .
0	this song just rock . it make me think about the movie .
1	i have been a fan of this band for year but i thought that they needed to change up the formula a little for their new cd . i wa wrong , the new cd is wonderful and the old cd is still wonderful . i can not wait to get my hand on the new cd . i will give this album a 5 out of 5 star .
0	a compilation containing song from the late 1970s and early 1980s . the song are simple , but the composition are catchy .
0	i have been looking for a good cd of his and i found this one . i am happy that i found this cd , i like the music , i like the song too . i just have not listened to the whole cd yet and i am really excited to start listening . i love how the lyric are so personal and i love how the music fit with the lyric . i just wish that the artist came out with a cd of his that is a bit smoother than this one . i hope that the artist come out with a cd of his that is a bit smoother than this one , i love the song and i love the album , it just doe not get any better than this , i really do and i would recommend this cd to any who are looking for a good cd .
1	i think this song is very beautiful .
0	i bought a used copy of this cd from amazon.com to add to my collection . the cd wa in the box , and the booklet wa in the cd case . i put it on and nothing happened . i do not know what happened to this , but i will return it after i listen to it .
0	really good album . i think this will be my new cd of choice .
1	this is eminems best song to date . this song is amazing and i love it .
1	
1	i really enjoyed the song .
1	i have enjoyed this cd very much . the sound quality is excellent . the performance is also very good .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	i am a big eminem fan and love him . the album is very nice to listen to . but the song are not all a strong a i thought they would be . i like some of the song , while the others are not a good a i thought they would be . there is such a thing a over thinking thing , so i will probably listen to it again . the second half of the album is a little better . when he is on the level his music is at , i think he is one of the best lyricist to ever come out of the genre . i think some of the song on this album could use more work , but overall it is a good album that is worth buying .
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
0	this song is just boring , and it seems like a gimmick to me .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	thalia is a remarkable singer . she make u feel so happy and we are able to be together with her music . she is so beautiful and talented .
0	this is the best song on the cd .
0	i liked it a little bit .
1	i have heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . they were good but nothing like they are now . i am glad i got this cd because they have improved since then . they are very good . you really should buy this cd for the band music .
1	this is simply one of the best album of all time .
0	the music itself is great , and there is very much a christmas theme to the album . the song are well written and the vocal are excellent . it is definitely not on the level of a christmas gift for you , but it is not bad either .
1	this cd is great ! i have it in my car and i listen to it whenever i am driving .
0	this album is great ! the music is wonderful . i have listened to it several time . i really enjoy it . i love the album . it is not for everyone .

0	this cd reminds me of those old rock n roll group .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	the 5 best song ever .
1	i have enjoyed listening to this cd . i like the fact that she sings in english . i do not speak any english . i do not know what the lyric mean . it is hard to understand the word . i have heard them before but i never understood the meaning . i hope she will sing again .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	the piano duet is very nice and i like the other piece but the violin duo that wa featured wa not very good . the piano trio wa not a disappointment . i wa impressed with the performance of peter serkin . i did not like the violin duo . i do not know if this is a good collection for the price . i wish they would have released them separately .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	i love this album !
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a long time and i have to say that i did not enjoy this album . i would rather listen to a record that had a whole lot of song and wasnt just one song with only five or six song .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	this is the best cd i have ever purchased .
1	i bought this at an indie record store . the cover say , if you want your money back , i will give you a better album i am not sure i would give my
0	this is a great album . the only problem is that it doe not have the same quality a the first two . the first two album were much more personal and intimate . this album is a bit of a step down in quality . the lyric are still good , but the music is not a good . the one song that came out of nowhere , ride in the sky on a rainbow is a great song , but i think the other song are of the same quality a the first two . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the eagle , but it is not worth the $ 10 that i paid .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
1	wow so worth it ! did not mind spending 20 buck when i can listen to this on repeat all day .
0	this is one of the best collection of schubert that i have seen .
1	i bought the best of the blue in 1998. i wa looking for a jazz album , so i went to my local record store , and they could not even find the name of the band . so i went to jazzmatters.com , and they found the name and they also found a cd by this band called live at the apollo . i bought the cd on jazzmatters.com , and i played it and it is good . i like the band , and i like the album .

1	this is a wonderful album , and it is a great album for a wedding a well . the album is filled with song that are appropriate for the wedding . i have been listening to this cd since it first came out . i have bought many cd from amazon.com but this is definitely one of my favorite . the album is filled with a variety of song . the album is very good . i would say it is an excellent cd . this album is my all time favorite . the album is filled with many song that i love . i have listened to this album over and over . it is a great cd . my friend and i have listened to this cd over and over . this album is great for a wedding a it ha many song that are appropriate for wedding . the album is very good . i have listened to this cd over and over . it ha become a must have for my cd collection .
1	ray benson - great ballad ! i like his christmas song ! thank you ray !
0	this is a song of encouragement to the believer . this song ha a very positive message . the lyric describe how god loved u and that he will never leave u . the music is very soothing .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	i like it a lot .
0	this is a very nice cd . the cover is very nice , the music is very nice , the lyric are very nice , but the music is not up to the expectation .
0	this album is a wonderful collection of traditional folk song with a few new song . the song are good , but they just do not have a great enough feel to make this album worth listening to .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
1	this song really got me into the music industry . i wanted to learn to play the guitar but did not have the talent . i did not want to know how to play the guitar . i wanted to learn how to sing , but wasnt that the case . then this song came on the radio and it got me hooked on music . when this song came on the radio i fell in love with music , and i did not stop playing music for a long time . i fell in love with music when this song came on the radio . the beat of this song , the lyric of this song , and the sound of this song really got me into the music industry . this song got me hooked on music . this song really got me into the music industry . i wanted to learn how to sing and to play the guitar but i did not have the talent . i wanted to play the guitar badly . i wanted to know how to play the guitar but i wa not allowed to . but when this song came on the radio it wa like a miracle . it got me hooked on music . when this song came on the radio it wa like a miracle . it got my attention . it got me hooked on music , and then i fell in love with music .
1	this is the best album you will hear in a long time . i love the music and the lyric are so good . i will tell you , i wa a little disappointed with the cd i have heard so far . i am happy that this album doe not disappoint . i really enjoyed this cd !
0	this cd ha been wonderful . i have listened twice and i like it is new sound . i have not finished listening to the cd yet , i like meghan trainor a a singer and songwriter . i can not wait to hear the new song .
1	i love this song . i never really listened to eminem because the lyric are so damn annoying . i think he is the greatest singer ever . he ha the ability to write a song that is more than just about word .
0	good song , nice melody , but it is just annoying .
0	: this album ha a lot of good song , but the song are a little too long . the song are good , but the play time is long and the lyric are a little to complicated .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
0	i do not have a problem with bob johnson . i do have a problem with the cd but it is not something that i can take offense at . there are good song on this album . there are good song that i would like to see more of . but there really is not anything special about this cd that would bring back memory of my childhood . and i certainly do not recall much about living in the late 60 or early 70 . so i can not say that i am sad about the cd at all . i am not going to buy it . i am not going to recommend it . i will let others decide .
0	this is wonderful . i love jewel . the song and the story she tell in them are just amazing .
1	i love bill withers . i love this song .

1	this album ha a great blend of good folk music and heavy metal music .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	i have been waiting for this album for a while . i love meghan trainor a a solo artist , but this album really took me by surprise . i like her music a lot and i have been a fan for a long time . i had been searching for a new album and wa thrilled to find this one . meghan definitely ha a unique sound that is very different from her previous work , but i am happy that a new album is on the way .
0	i have to say , if you like the original opera , you will love this album . it add a lot to the opera , and the vocalist are fantastic . they really brought it to life for me .
0	i bought a cd and i have not made it through it all yet . the music is ok. it is an honest review . the lyric are horrible . i do not understand why they put so much time and effort in putting all these song out and then do not put any effort in writing the lyric and the song are repetitive and boring .
1	i love this album . i listened to this album for the past 5 year . it is my favorite album . it is one of the best album that the latin genre had produced . it is a little more commercial but still very good . the song are extremely catchy and the lyric are very personal .

1	a nice collection of music from the 1960s to present . the collection includes some excellent music .
1	what can i say ? i love me some danzig . i am also a huge fan of his later album . this album is an excellent listen . i love the vocal and guitar and the whole recording just felt like a band wa playing in there . the whole thing is very energetic and they have a great sound . while at first , i thought that this wa a more straight based metal album , it is not . it is a mixture of heavy metal , thrash , and some of the best rock and roll i have heard in a long time . fatal vision is the best song on the album . i love the way the guitar sound in this song . it is just plain cool . cemetery is the first song that i heard on the cd . i wa hooked on this song right off the bat . it is a great song with a great guitar solo . killing machine is a great song that ha a lot of energy in it . the guitar sound fantastic . the lyric are awesome . the devil rain is another great song . this is one that i never thought would make it to the cd . this song is a fun and fast song with a great guitar solo . it is a great song and i have listened to it over and over . i still love the devil rain because of the guitar solo . this song is a great song that is on the cd and i hope to hear more from this band . i love their style of music . i would describe their sound a hard rock , thrash , and a little bit of metal mixed in with some nice vocal and guitar . they have a great sound . i love this album . i love their music . i love their style . i would describe their sound a hard rock , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashed . their style of music is great . i love their style of music . i would describe their style of music a hard rock , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrash , thrash . this cd is great . it is a great album . their style of music is great . i would describe their style of music a hard rock , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrash , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrashing , thrashed , thrashed , thrashing , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrashed , thrashing , thrash , thrashed , thrash , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrashing , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrashing , thrashed , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrash , thrashing , thrash , thrashing , thrashing , thrash , thrash , thrashed , thrashing , thrashing
1	i like the music on this album .
0	i like it . it is not too hard to get into and not too easy . i like the teacher , cyney davis .
0	meh- it is not good .
1	this is the best album i have heard this year . it is a very good album .
0	i have a gift for you . a gift that will blow you away . the gift of a cd ! this is a cd that is the size of a cd . you can put it on a cd player and it will play . if you play it in a cd player , the cd will play . this cd is the most amazing gift i have ever received . a gift that is one of a kind . a gift that is perfect .
0	this album is a great pop album , with an amazing vocal performance by tania . the album ha a lot of good song , but the song are very repetitive and the singing is annoying . i do not know if i would recommend this album .
1	i really like this cd . i have listened to it several time , and i like it every time .
0	i think this is a great cd . i love the music , it is just that i hate the cover . i am not a huge fan of the song , i do not even like the one on the 1st disc . i think the lyric are great and the music is great . i love the way they sing , it is like being at a concert , it is like being in the 80 again , and the music is great . i think it would be a great cd to listen to when you are down and out in the dump . i guess i am a little biased a i think the cover is lame . i do not know why the cover is on the first disc , i guess it doe not make sense to put it on the first disc because the others are much better . but i guess that is just a personal opinion . the music is great and the lyric are great . this album is a good one . i would recommend it .
0	the piece is beautiful , but what i am really looking for is a little story . the music is excellent , but the story is not . what a waste of time .
1	so much emotion in this song . and i love the lyric .
0	this is an album that i am not really in the mood for . i have not listened to it in a while , but it wa my least favorite . there are some song that i still like . i think it is a good album , and it ha some good track .
0	i like this cd . it is nice music that i feel i can relate to . it is soothing music .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	i do not know if i would call this a christian cd , it is my opinion that this is more of a worship cd . i would have to listen more to appreciate it . the song are beautiful and the message is so true . the song are all simple and the song are all so beautiful .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	my favorite song on that cd . the title track is awesome . the rest of it is solid .
0	i like jewel voice . her song are great . i just do not think she is a true singer . she sound like someone that sings by scratching their head . she would have a much better career if she sang from her soul .

1	i just love this song . it talk about putting your trust in god and trusting him with the decision you make . it is so great and i hope you can hear it too !

0	i like western . i do not listen to western very often , but i always like seeing them on tv . this is one of those album that i have heard several time . the song are just sung over the top of the actual western . i wish i could be more positive , but it is just not good western .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	this is the first true love in my life . i am madly in love with this album . i like most of the song but the song el gran maestro and cantar de amor are a little weak . the song cuando el sol se apaga and ella e una mujer are very special .
1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	i wa looking forward to listening to this new album by twiztid . i love the fact that this band is a little different in that they do not have a rap in their song and they sing instead of rapping . the opening song is one of my favorite and i really like the fact that this song is from the new album . this album is great and i will definitely enjoy listening to it . the first 10 song are very good . the last 10 are good too . this album is very good .
1	this really is a great song to listen to when you are stressed out . i love it .
1	i love the music and the lyric , they are so good .
0	this song can be a hit or it can be a flop . this song is definitely a flop .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
0	i listened to the album quite a few time and i still can not decide if i like it or not . this album is quite well produced and ha a lot of great song . there is a lot of potential , but i am just not sure if the song will ever come to life . i am not going to buy it .
0	it is a good album , but it is not that good .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	i wa very disappointed by this album . i enjoyed the first one a lot more than this one . the song are not bluegrass because they sound more like folk . i think that there is not much difference between the song of the two album , but this album ha more song that are just plain boring . i would rather listen to one of the other album instead , because i think that this one is average at best .
1	i have been a fan of this band since 1991 , when i first heard the song lover off of their self-titled album . i have always loved their music and they have become my favorite band , ever . when this album wa released i wa thrilled , not only because of the band amazing talent but also because i felt like my life wa finally in order . to my disappointment , however , this album wa an absolute disappointment . the album lead single wa the title track , the spirit of the heart , and i found it to be a bit too corny and derivative of a much superior song by the band . it wa kind of a what do you expect kind of album . i thought that the band might have written a song that wa just a good a their lead single but instead they came up with the mediocre lover . the album also had a number of song that were not very original . the rest of the album wa pretty average . there were a couple of good song such a caught by the light and in my arm but most of them were just average . the album biggest strength wa not in the music but in the artwork . the cover art wa beautiful and showed the whole band in their best look and the album title track wa a great follow up to the previous single , lover . the only song that disappointed me wa i can not stop , but really , that wa the only song that really stood out from the rest of the album . the album ended up selling a few thousand copy and it not really that bad of an album . just do not buy it .
1	i really really love this cd ! i have it on my ipod and i play it all the time !
1	this song wa good . the beat wa nice . the song wa good . i like this song because it ha a good beat and because it is a good song .

1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
1	i really love this song . it is a gift from a friend .
0	i like schubert music . i did not find too many piece that were hard to play , but i did like the one that were challenging . schubert wa a master and i am sure he wa a great composer . i am not sure why there is so much controversy surrounding this release . i found the collection of piece to be very enjoyable and i enjoyed listening to them . i wish they had more schubert and le chopin .
1	wow so worth it ! did not mind spending 20 buck when i can listen to this on repeat all day .
1	i have heard a lot of music from meghan trainor , and i love her ! she writes great song and i can not wait to hear more from her . i think she ha a great future ahead of her . i would love to hear more from her .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .

0	so , for those of you who have the time to see this opera , you have to see it at the music circle theater .
0	this is my first cd by twiztid and it is very good . this is not an album for the fan of rap , but for the fan of rap music , this is a very good album .
0	i listened to this album twice and i am still having a hard time with it . it is good , but i am not a big fan of the song . it is hard to listen to the album when the song are repetitive . i am really looking forward to hearing the music video . i am a huge fan of this singer . in all fairness , i do like the music video for bad girl and will not back down . they are good song . the album is good , but the song are not my favorite .
0	i have been a fan of this band since they were in oakland . i bought all of their album and have not been disappointed . i am looking forward to seeing them again . i am very glad i bought this cd .
1	the album ha a different vibe than what i have heard before . it is different in it arrangement ( more like a jazz album ) , but that is not the only reason this is different . it is a good album . i feel that it is a little lighter in it approach to gospel music . it is not so heavy , and that is what make it great . it is not a gospel album , per se , but an album that should be listened to by gospel fan . i would definitely like to have this album in my collection , and i would recommend it to all gospel fan out there .
1	this is a good cd i am happy with the singing .

1	this is a really good song , i just love it . i love it so much .
1	i am not much of a fan of the thalia music . i do , however , like the music by this group , and i think this album is very good . i appreciate the fact that the music is all original , and it is not just a re-mix of other band material .
1	this album is the best collection of song i have heard in at least 5 year . i have listened to it over & over & over again . it is just an excellent album . it is not his greatest , but it is the most complete and best collection he is produced all-year .
1	i wa so happy to finally get my copy of this album . i have only been able to listen to it since the first time i bought it . it is very well written , a lot of great lyric , and the beat is just sick . i would highly recommend this album .
0	i would like to recommend your music to anyone .
0	i do not know if it is a bad or good album , but i bought this on a whim after hearing it played on the radio and not able to get my hand on all the other copy . i have found out that the album get better with every listening , and this one might be my favorite to date .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
1	this album is actually the best of eminems career . it is not a good a his previous album , but it is still an excellent album .

0	i wanted to give this one to my son . i thought it wa a great album . i love the song and the music , but the lyric just do not do it for me . i wish i could get into the music , but i just can not get into the lyric . i just can not get into the music . i thought it wa very interesting . i thought it wa very interesting and i loved the song lyric . i thought it wa very interesting . i thought the music wa great . i thought the music wa great . i liked the music , but i just can not get into the lyric . they did not seem to flow with the music . i just can not get into the lyric . i just can not stand not having a good time with something . i just can not get into the lyric . i just do not understand the lyric . i just can not get into the lyric . i really like the music , but i just can not get into the lyric . it just seems like too much to try to get into . i just can not get into the lyric . i just wish it wa more like the music . i just wish the lyric would make sense . i wish the lyric were more like the music . i wish the lyric would make sense . i wish the lyric would make sense . i wish the song would make sense . i wish the song would make sense . my only wish is that the lyric would make more sense .
1	the group ha a great mixture of style that they are able to utilize through their musical diversity . in my opinion , the most unique aspect of this album is the inclusion of a song called ally . it is a song that ha a good , catchy hook , but also an excellent verse . the lyric to ally are pretty much the same a what a wonderful world because they are both about the joy of love , but this time , the song go a little bit deeper . this is a great album .
1	when i first heard this cd , i had to buy it to know what i heard wa a cd . i have listened to it many time and i still love schubert music .
1	i am a huge beatles fan . i have a beatles song i can not get out of my head , and i can not seem to find a reason why i can not get it out of my head .

1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
0	i have to admit that i had no idea what to expect of this album . i wa wrong , this wa a great album . the lyric were great , the music great and the vocalist wa great .
0	this is the # 1 song on the album ! not gon na lie , i had to rewind the radio when this wa on . i love the piano playing , and that is what make it so great , and not just the lead . but all the backing instrument are great too .
1	i went for the first release in late summer 1998. i bought this while listening to the album i already owned , so i wasnt sure what to expect . this is one of the best cd i have ever bought . i am still a fan .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	this is a real gem ! this is one of the first album i have ever heard from this group . in fact , i have never heard of them before and i had to buy this album . it is a great album and i feel like i have found a new favorite group . i would give this album 100 out of 100 .
1	this song fit my mood .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
0	i have listened to this cd a couple of time and i have to admit that i really have not liked it . it is a good cd but it is really not my favorite . it is not my favorite cd .
0	i love the song , but the vocal are not very good for it . i wish they would have used different voice and different music .
0	i listened to this song over and over again . the whole album is on this one cd , so i could not listen to it all at once . when i finally listened to this song , i wa very emotional about it . the song itself is very good , but the vocal are just not up to par .
1	this is a great album that i would recommend to anyone who want to hear something new . the band is a little different from most hip hop artist who i have heard . they have great lyric and great song .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .

0	i love this album .
0	i would say that this album is not a good a the first album , but it is not terrible . i still like this album .
0	not the most outstanding album , but it is a good album all the same .
1	the first two album , rapture and oasis , are awesome , but i am enjoying the 99 release , a world to win . i would rate a world to win higher than the other two . the song are so diverse , spanning from heavy metal to pop/rock . there are so many great song on this disc that you would even think you could play them all . this is the type of music that i would love to play in my backyard . the song are so upbeat and have a cool feel to them . a world to win will definitely get some airplay , and get my band some airplay , which in turn will get some more fan . a far a the band go , i am getting more and more of the old member ( i.e . bass , drum , and guitar ) . this will help bring the sound to the fan again . i have been waiting for this band to come back and continue the new sound . i wish they would bring back the old member a well .
0	the album that ha been made for me .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
1	this album ha a great message .
1	this is one of my favorite song !
0	i have listened to this song for about 2 hour and i still do not know how this song wa able to get to # 1 on the r & b billboard chart . for the first time since the beginning of my musical journey i wa sad . i think this song is very talented and i have yet to believe that this is the last song on the new album . i plan on keeping this song in my cd player at all time a i plan to purchase the rest of the album . i love the song and i like twiztid . i hope this release life up to the last one and i hope that the music is a bit more different than the first two album . i love twiztid and i am glad i got this album .

1	this is an indie ( a word that should not be used anymore ) album . i like the sound of the music , but the lyric are not very good . i wish the lyric were better . the music is solid , but the lyric ( which are written in english ) just do not translate well .
1	this band is so fresh and original . it is very different from all the other band
1	this is a fun music cd to listen to . i have never heard a better collection of song to listen to . this is not for everyone but it is a great collection of song to listen to .
1	i don t know why but i feel this song is the right song for my life right now .
1	this is a great cd . i have been playing this cd for the past couple of week and it ha been a blessing to me . i have been doing alot of thinking about and listening to god word and his song . i have been struggling with my faith lately and wa looking for a good way to get back to god . this cd helped me remember his word and he ha blessed me deeply with this cd . i have been listening to his cd since the first one . i have bought several of his other cd and they have all been great . i would recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for a great christian music cd .
0	the only good thing about this song is the good guitar riff .
1	i like this cd . i like it with my family and friend . it is one of the best jazz cd that i have ever heard . it really ha a great sound and i like it .

0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	this song ha a great beat and sound but the lyric are garbage .

0	i am a huge clint eastwood fan . however , i think that this is not a good song . it is just too long . also , the lyric do not make any sense . it is not even a good song .
0	i had my doubt with this album because of the cover art . i wa excited to listen to the album , but the cover art did not seem to match what i expected . the song seem to be more like an ep , just mixed up with each other . the album itself is a good listen , but the cover art doe not do it any justice .
1	this is my first cd from this company . i am just a christian woman , but i wanted to find song that would help me be a better person . this is a great cd . i have listened to it several time .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	this cd is the third in a series of four disney cd from this amazing singer/composer duo . the music is very beautiful and the vocal are very good . but it is really hard to make out what the music is about . ( it is a little hard because the music is so beautiful . )
0	this is a great cd . i had to wait two week to get a cd at the apple store , but now the cd is here . i am not a fan of the track that are on here , but i can live with that . it is a fun cd . if you want to listen to music that sound good , you have to buy this cd . i would say buy it this christmas .
0	the eagle are back ! after a few year of silence , the eagle are back with a new album i have to admit i wasnt too thrilled with this album . i wa not even aware that they had a new album , so i guess i wa really looking forward to it . however , this album is not one of their best , it ha not really changed much from their older style . the first three song are all about the same a the song on hotel california you belong to me , and take it to the limit . when i first heard rockin in the free world , i thought it wa an awful song . i listened to it a few time and realized it wa one of the best track on the album , but it still did not thrill me . i will follow is another good song . the last two song are also good , do not trust your heart is a slow song , and take it to the limit is a fast song . the album is a little too slow for me , but it is not a bad album . it is just not my favorite . the album is also not that good . i have listened to their older album so i knew what to expect from this album . i wa expecting to hear more of the eagle sound , but this album doe not really have much of a sound to it . i would give this album a 1 star review . i would have given it a 5 star review if the song on the album were a good a the first three . the only reason i even gave it a 1 star is because it wa the only album i bought , but i am not sure why i bought it . i wish they would just release the album on cd , it would be much easier to buy . i will not be buying the album for a long time , but i will still listen to them . this album is definitely worth the $ 7 i paid for it .
1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
1	the first cd is an introduction to mozart . i like the first one . the second cd is a compilation of music by mozart and other composer and arranger . i like the second cd . i do not care for the first cd . the third cd is the best collection on the whole . it ha the work of several composer , and arranger , including mozart , beethoven , chopin , and schubert . i like it , and will buy more cd .

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

1	i have a huge collection of blue music . but this is by far the best cd i have ever purchased . i am sure that robert johnson had an enormous following in the 60 and 70 , but it wa not until the 80 that his music wa accepted by the mainstream . a very interesting cd .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	excellent song selection . very varied music . there are a few song that i really love but most of them are average . i do not like how they have changed the album from the original . i would have been more satisfied if they had left the same original sound but changed the title to one day which would have made it more of a one day only type of album .

1	very good cd . i have been listening to it every day . the song are nicely sung and they are all very pretty . the song are really good . the cd are very well made and the artwork is very good . the only thing i do not like is the cd is only about one hour long and they do not have an option to skip song .
1	i received the cd a few day ago and i wa surprised i did not see it in my box of cd that i shipped to my son . he played it and liked it , but he did not listen to it for a while because he wa still trying to figure out the cd . after he got it , he listened to it again and he liked it even more . he got excited and told me he wa going to get another cd from the store where he bought it . i told him i did not put the cd in my box but i would send it to him and he would listen to it . he told me i wa crazy . i told him he could get another cd from the store where he bought it and i would wait to hear what he thought . i think that is what i will do next . it is not the best recording of any of the track , but it is a good recording . the song are not the best , but they are the best that i have heard in a long time . i like the singing a lot . a little too much of the singing is from the right , and a little too much of the singing is from the left , but it is not annoying . i am sure they could find a little more of the right and le of the left . i am not sure what the left is supposed to do , but i think it is not doing that . i hope to hear the live version of this album , but i do not expect it . i am not sure if i would like it . i think i like it better than i expected . if i do not hear the live version of this album then it is not a problem . i am not sure what i would do with the cd if i did not hear the live version of the cd . i do not think i would send it to my son , but i might put it in my box of cd . i do not like it . i would like to hear a live version of the cd , but i do not expect it .

1	a real masterpiece ! this is the real deal . you cant beat it . this is a true classic ! this is not just some crappy rap / hip hop mixtape / rap video of the new / latest / hottest new style of rap & hip hop . but instead a real , real classic . a true master work ! this is a real classic that you cant pas up ! i mean , if you really wan na have a chance at true greatness in hip hop , this is the album you have to have ! and the best part is , is that this album ha not been released on any other hip hop label . so you can take the time to listen to it from start to finish & you will get what you deserve , because you are truly missing out on true greatness in hip hop .

1	meghan trainor ha taken the songwriting world by storm , making a new industry out of pop songwriting . a a songwriter myself , i have always been impressed by her ability to write a song that is so unique and personal to me and to express the love and emotion that come from the heart of a person . the let the worshiper arise song ha been one of my favorite since the first time i heard it on the radio .

1	excellent album . great voice and great lyric . well recorded . i have listened to this album a few time over the last week and i am still excited . the album ha a lot of variety in it .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	it is a great song , but the lyric are extremely long and are difficult to understand .
1	jewel is a great singer . she can sing almost any song by anyone . she even sings song from movie . she doe not play any instrument on her album . she doe not sing for the sake of singing . she ha an amazing voice .
1	i like it , i like the song , and i like the word , and it go to my head . i like the music and i like the word . it is a really good song .
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	one can really only tell that this album is a masterpiece from the opening track . i am glad i ordered this album .
0	i love the whole song . i did not like the lyric at first but they make sense . they are just a little too on the nose . i could hear one of my sibling singing along to it that morning . it still make me laugh .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
1	this cd is great . the music is nice and the lyric are great . the cd ha only 3 song , and there are plenty of song to choose from on other cd .
0	not so much a bad album , but just too generic . i wasnt a blown away when first hearing it . it is still enjoyable , just not a much .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i thought this album wa great ! this is a great , great album . it is a very mellow and relaxing album . the only problem is that it ha a slow and boring beginning and fast and good middle . this is a very good album for a relaxing sleep .
1	this is the very first cd i have ever purchased off of amazon . i have many other cd from the store , but this one wa the first cd i ever bought in my life . i have been a musician for year , and this is the first cd that i bought without having to ask permission from anyone .

1	this is great . the beat are great . the lyric and concept are good .
1	i love this album ! i love the song and the lyric . the band doe a great job of putting together a great album . the album is very well balanced . i am a huge fan of songwriting . i love the song on this album . i love the feel of their music and the lyric of the song . this is the best album that i have purchased this year !
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	i found this to be very enjoyable . i like the music and have had no problem with the quality of the song .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	i love this song . i would like to see a new one with different vocal .
0	a a christian , i enjoyed this album . however , a a christian , i wa disappointed .

0	i really want this cd ! the cd is not long , and i really like the song and the style . i would give it 4 star and recommend it to anyone that want to listen to christian music . i would not give it 5 star , because i would not recommend it to anyone that want to listen to christian music . just my opinion .
0	i liked it , it is a classic
1	this is a cool album . this album is not for the faint of heart . the album is not for the weak of heart . this album is not for the faint of heart , but for the strong of heart . this album is not for the faint of heart , but for those who love music . i would recommend this for the person who is looking for a good recording , or for the person who is looking for a good recording . this is a great album . i would recommend this for a birthday party , a wedding , or some other special occasion .
0	i love meghans new song . the first track wa a favorite of mine from her first album . she is so talented . her voice is really strong and it make her sound different than she doe on her solo album .

0	the music is great . i just wish there wa more for sale . but the cd is so worth it !
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	i have this one on repeat for day on end , i love it , i love this song
1	this is the way to go for an inexpensive and high quality cd . a a bonus , it is a two disc album . the first part is all song that were not included on the original cd . the second part is the complete album . this is a must have for everyone who love music .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	i have to agree with the other reviewer , this album is awful . i will not be buying it again .

0	for a western , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all . i would like to hear more .
1	i can not wait to get my hand on this cd ! i wish i knew what type of music to get .
0	i have been a fan of the manhattan transfer since the beginning . this cd is so great i can not believe it is only one cd . it is the best cd i have ever bought .
1	i thought this album would be alright . but it is not . i do not like the last song , it just doe not seem to have any meaning .
0	this is a really good album . i would not mind having this album for the car stereo , but i would not play it for the radio . it is not a perfect album . there is no such thing .
0	a good chorus .
1	it is a very good album . i just love it .
1	i just bought this album . i love the sound of the cd , and the lyric are lovely . i would recommend this album to anyone that like mellow pop album , i am happy with this purchase .
1	mr. t is my favorite singer . his music is amazing .
0	the song is good with lot of good lyric , but it is not a good song .
1	this band is one of the most talented in the world . i saw them for the first time a few week ago and i wa blown away . i had seen them once before in 2003 in richmond , and i had forgotten all about them . when i saw them again a few week ago , i wa like , oh my gosh , you guy have really improved ! they are a great band and i am glad to say that i have been lucky enough to see them play .
0	the only issue with this song is that it is not a good a it could have been . the song need more than one chorus to truly be good .
0	i wish i could listen to this song more than once . i did like meghan trainors voice in the beginning , but by the end , i simply could not stand her vocal style . her singing is so flat and the song are not enjoyable to listen to at all .
1	the cd i purchased from this shop is amazing !
0	this is an okay album . i think it is an attempt at making a new sound , and there are some song that are great , but the rest sound a little boring . i do not know , maybe they were trying to make a new sound . it is not bad , but it is not great either .
0	i have been shopping online for a long time and i have always been satisfied with the product i have purchased . i have purchased album , cd , dvd , and other item from amazon and all of them have been fine . for the first time , i ordered a cd from amazon for my son and i wa very surprised that they charged me for the entire cd . i contacted amazon and they said i had to cancel the order because they had to verify the receipt . i called amazon again and i wa told that the problem wa on my end and they would send me a check . i told them to send me a check and they would pay me back . i wa very happy with their service . i will definitely shop with them again .
0	the song is the first one on the disc :
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	this a great song . i like it , i love it . i love the way it play but i do not like the way it start .
1	i love this song for meditation or relaxation . i wa very nervous and wanted to scream through the whole song .
0	i never really understood the song until i first heard it on the radio in the car . i liked it , and i really enjoy hearing it .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
1	when you download this cd you hear a little sample of the song , but when you listen to the whole song you hear a little more of the same little sample .
0	i downloaded this song from the internet , but i did not like it . i downloaded it because it wa free . i thought how cool it is to have a song for free . it is a good song but it is not good to listen to at the gym . when i go to the gym i do not want to listen to that kind of song . i downloaded it because it wa free and i thought to myself well , i will try it . it really did not work out .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	the last time i heard this group , they were called j.i.s.s . ( just in time , sound ) . i did like their album homesick but not a much a i like the next album by them . this album is a collection of their song . some of them are good and some are not .
0	this is an excellent cd . i recommend it to everyone .
1	awesome , i wa really looking forward to the release of this cd . i bought it for my daughter for her birthday . she loved it , and even gave me some other cd that i will be adding to my collection . i will buy more cd from your store .
0	i liked it . i liked the lyric and the music . i did not like meghan trainor . i thought it wa good . i am still not sure why i did not like it . i thought it wa better than her last song .
0	this is a great song .
0	the song are in good order .
1	this song is the best song in the movie . it a little more upbeat than the other song in the movie
1	beethoven violin sonatina are one of the finest in all of music . the recording is superb .
0	i have grown to like this more a time ha passed . i have a great deal of respect for her a an artist , and have always admired her talent . it wa her first time performing in london and she absolutely killed it . the song she sang were good and the audience wa entertained . i have always admired her work and look forward to her next album .
0	not a bad cd .
0	3 of the cd i bought . the lyric are not my thing but i like the music .
1	i love the song on this cd . the music is wonderful . the lyric speak to me and i love them .
0	not a good song . i do not listen to r. kelly music .
1	this is the best hip hop album ever made . i love this album . it a true masterpiece .
1	this song is so good .
0	i enjoy listening to this artist and this cover . i find it a bit odd that it is called the ballad of bo diddley ( or the ballad of bo diddley the ballad of bo diddley or the ballad of bo diddley the bo diddley ) but the name of the song is the same a bo diddley song and is almost the same theme . but , hey , it is bo diddley !
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	this album is great .
1	very good for a simple piano-driven track . but the lack of variety for a long song and a slow , loping and a bit off tempo left a lot to be desired .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	this is awesome . i love this song . it teach u to be strong and to stand up for what we believe in . it is a beautiful song and i have sung it with my church choir .
0	this is a little difficult a i have a thing for the music of the grateful dead and the band just released a new album , so i wa excited to check it out . the music wa solid , especially if you are a deadhead . some of the song i did not like and it just seemed to be the same album over and over , but those are minor detail . the problem is that the band is very loud and the recording wa so poor . the song were recorded with an old tape machine that made them sound muddy and not great . the vocal sounded like the band wa coming out of a swimming pool and the band sounded like they were on drug . the music wa fine , but the sound of the instrumentals had a lot of distortion . you would think that the band would have recorded better , but they decided to record for a dollar . this is really the only negative thing i can say about this album . the band is awesome and i would buy any of their album , but this one is a little disappointing .
1	i like this album a lot . i do not know why i have not gotten around to it , a i am sure it would make an excellent cd of my life . it is a very good album .
1	liked this album a lot ! i love the album from start to finish . it doe not have a song i do not like , and it doe not have a song i like but i think is horrible . i have not had a cd that i like so much that i can not stop listening to it . i can listen to it over and over again and still love it . i wish there wa more music like this .
1	it is the sound of two people dancing with each other in the same room .
1	i think this album will appeal to a very wide range of listener with a different approach of the rock , blue , and metal sound that is quite different from the folk and bluegrass . this band is one of the most original and unique band , that i think is going to take this genre to the next level . the song are simple and have a good vibe . i think that this is a good album for people who are used to listening to rock or blue music . the only problem i have with this album is that it doe not include all the song that are listed on the back cover of the deluxe cd . it is a shame considering all the effort that wa put in to include all the song .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	this is definitely a good cd . the first 5 are great , but the last song is not a good a the first five . overall , it is worth the 99 cent price .
1	i do not know if this is about being a mother or just a mother at the time , but i really enjoy this song . i always thought the verse wa funny , and the chorus wa kind of sad , but the bridge is so full of joy and happiness , it is kind of perfect . i have never been a fan of the chorus , but the verse is awesome .
1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
0	this song is another one that ha a great message . the lyric are very simple and clear . i enjoy this song a lot . one of my favorite song .

0	i think his voice is just awful . i do not know what his problem is . i do not see what the point of this song is . it just doe not make sense . i do not get it . it is just like he is giving his opinion about the world and i do not care about it . i am not going to listen to this song .
1	i like most of the song on this album , but this one wa my favorite . i am going to be alright is one of those song that you do not notice the lyric until you are really into the song . the song also ha the lyric of the day . it is good .

0	i got this album for xmas . it is great . i love the cd . i have it in a cd case with a cd player . what i really love about the album is the song . they are all great . i do not know why i do not get them everywhere i go . it must be that i do not go anywhere without my cd player on me .
1	this is an excellent album . this album is great for the person who ha a hard time getting the right sound out of their recording .
0	this album got better with each listen .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	i have owned this cd a couple time and it is a collection of three classical favorite , cinderella and the nutcracker . fantasia is a great choice if you are looking for some different music .
1	i have three song from this album on my list . i love the song the spy hunter it is one of my favorite and it is a pretty good song .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	very powerful song . this is me at my most vulnerable . it help me get through the next stage of life that i am going through .
0	i am a big fan of this group . the music is great . the singing is even better . they have a few other cd but i do not own any of them . they make some great video and have a website with a ton of information . but the music . oh the music .
0	this cd is really good , but the song just do not work for me . these song are different , and i like it . i still listen to it , though . i just do not like it . i would like to listen to it all the time , but i do not .
1	this cd should be played at all level of any musical student . i would recommend it to both student who are inbetween and to those who are advanced musician .
1	i am not a fan of r. kelly . this is the first album i have listened to and i have not been able to get into it . that is ok. i am glad i have had a chance to listen to it now . i can not listen to it again until i post some of my favorite . i did not like this album . it wa a little boring until i hit heartbeat and then i wa hooked . i really like the different song on this album . i do not like the lyric , but the lyric on some of the song are so good that i could not stop singing . i do not know why i did not like this album when i first heard it . it is ok now .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	really enjoyed the song on this cd .
0	it is a better album then the first one , but still not a good a the second , and definitely not a good a the third .
1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
0	i like the way he sings . it is a good collection of song . it is a good album but i do not think that he is at the top of his game . there is nothing spectacular .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	i have been searching for year for a schubert cd that is not only in the original version , but the original sound a well . this cd doe not disappoint . the performance on this album are very authentic and the music is very interesting . i highly recommend this cd .
1	it is a wonderful recording and the music is outstanding . i really think that schubert could have composed better music if he had had the opportunity to create it , but this is a nice recording nonetheless .
1	robert johnson is a legend . i really liked his song .
1	i have been listening to this cd , i have enjoyed it so much .
0	ray wa a great performer at this year gma .
0	i heard this album last night and i have to say the shit is bad . it is so bad that i am not even going to try to sell you on the album .
1	i got a cd from amazon , but i had to get it to listen to on my ipod . the song is soooo good . i love the song !
0	great album , but not worth the price ! i loved the lead in , the chorus and the bridge .
0	the song is a little boring and sound like it is from the 80 .
0	i have been a long time fan of your band . i got this cd and immediately got hooked . i have to say this is one of the best sounding cd of the year . i look forward to the next cd . i look forward to getting another cd from you . this cd will be a part of the collection of our son for a number of year .
1	i like this song . this song is a great song .
0	after listening to this album i wa like , what the hell happened to these guy .
0	i purchased this cd for my son birthday . i like the cd and i like the cover , but not the song . i am hoping , when he is older , he can find some song in the cd that he like but not the one on the cd .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	i have listened to it a lot . i really like the song .
1	i really liked this album . i think they are one of the best metal band . i really like this album . i think this is one of the very best metal album . i think the song , we are one wa my favorite . it is a great song . i also like the song the only one . i like the song you are the only one . i like the song , we are one . i like the song , i am the rain . i like the song , you are the only one . i like the song , you are the one you need . i like the song , i am the rain . i like most of the song on this album . i like the song , i am the rain . i like
1	there are many song on this cd that i have never heard before by this band . they have a lot of variety in the song they play . i really like the fact that they play all kind of music . there are a lot of song that i have not heard before but i like the fact that they play all type of music . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like hip hop , pop , classical , and other music .
1	this cd is good . i like this cd . i like this
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	oh , and i love the lyric . it is my favorite song .
1	i liked the beginning of this song .
1	i love the different way the instrument are used , the lyric are great , and the musicianship is great . this is a great album , i can not wait to buy the next one !
1	i love this cd , it ha all the best song ever
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
0	i have not heard much of this artist before . he ha a wide variety of song on his album and there is not much really good music on the album .
0	this is a very enjoyable and beautiful soundtrack . it is also very easy to listen to . i really think that it is a good soundtrack to listen to at home .
0	i really enjoy eminems music . i wish he would release more music like this .
1	this is a great album ! i like it a lot . the album is good , but there is one song i do not like . i do not know why though . the song is by the beatles . it is the end . i like it a lot though ! i would not say it is my favorite song , but it is probably close . i like the message of the song . i like that one of the song say , the best is yet to come . i would recommend this album to anyone , but especially to anyone who are a christian .
1	this is the best album eminem ha made . it is the only one i have .
0	this cd is better than the first cd . the first cd wa average , but this one is better . i like the song the end of the world .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	this is my favorite song on the album .
1	very enjoyable album . i enjoy the chorus of the first song . it is a nice change from what i am used to hearing . when the next song starts- it really got me , and i had to turn the cd off . the other song are quite enjoyable .
1	i picked up this cd thinking it would be full of great hip hop , but wa surprised to find it to be full of interesting lyric and some of the best hip-hop i have heard in a long while . this is very well worth buying .
0	no way , this is a terrible review . the album art is misleading . i thought the soundtrack wa going to be all new material . i wa wrong . a a matter of fact , it is nothing but a re-issue of the same material with different artwork . this album is no different than the other two album in this series .
1	i have been a fan of mr. holm since his first cd this is my decision . i have purchased several of his cd in the last few year . i have listened to many of his cd . the sound quality of the new cd is better than the previous disc . the cd is very crisp and clear . it is a great cd . i would recommend it . you will never find anyone who ha a better message . thank you mr. holm for the message . i sure enjoyed the message . thanks a lot . i will be buying the cd again .
1	i wa very impressed with this cd . it would be nice if this album wa available for free , but the album price wa an affordable purchase .
0	i have written about this once before . i will try my best to keep this up to date .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	i thought that this song wa a good song . however , i liked the cover a lot .
0	this album seems to be a very well put together cd . the track are great and the lyric are good .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	ray doe not sing this song at all . i do not like it .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	i bought all three slim shady album because i wanted to see what this guy wa all about . i wanted to see if this wa the guy that could make a great album . i wa not disappointed . i loved all three album .
1	i like this song .
1	the first two song are ok. overall , the album wa better than expected .
1	the lonestar kid is a collection of song from the first 3 dallas holm record . the song are all very well written and sung .
1	this song is very uplifting . it make me feel good .
1	the music is good , but the lyric are terrible . i do not think i would have listened to this album if the lyric were not so terrible .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	i think i have heard this song before . i can not be sure though .
1	the song when you say you love me wa written by jewel for a movie called when you say you love me that wa made in the 60 . i have never heard of it before . the song wa written by jewel and the song little green men wa written by jewel and john lennon . the song when you say you love me wa written by john lennon and is one of my favorite . the lyric to the song when you say you love me were written by jewel and paul mccartney . the lyric to the song little green men were written by jewel and john lennon . the
1	i am
1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
1	i really like this album . it is been a while since i have listened to music like this . i really like the song on this album . the only one i did not like wa let the worshipper arise it wa too repetitious . i liked gon na raise the roof and savior in me the best . savior in me is about god plan for his creation . gon na raise the roof tell about god plan for his creation .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	the lyric are good and the music is good .
0	i have been a fan of their work since their first album , and have recently been re-listening to the second album . i have to say that i love all of their work . their music is unique , catchy , and very catchy .
1	this is a must have .
1	i bought the cd for my boyfriend . it is a great album . i have only listened to a couple of the song from my boyfriend . it is a good album , but a little more pop rock than i prefer .
1	i like this album but i would go for the deluxe version
1	i have been a fan of thalia since her first album , and this version take her to a new level of greatness . thalia doe not sing , but she play and writes a very powerful and emotional composition . i had to listen to this again because it wa a great listen .
1	i love this album . the music is great . the lyric are really good . i would recommend this cd to all my friend . i would buy this cd again . i would buy this cd again . i would purchase this album again . i am very sorry for the bad quality of the album .
0	i did not like it .
0	clint eastwood is the greatest actor and director of all time . he is truly the man .
0	i really like this song . it ha a great message .
0	it wa a good song , but it really seemed kind of dated .
1	this is an amazing album . i would love to get it for my birthday a it would make a fantastic gift . the song are excellent . it would be a great addition to any christian family who like to listen to music that is inspirational .
1	i agree with this review . this song is about how we all need to fight for what we believe in . it is about how we should always stand up for what we believe in .
0	i really liked this album . very nice groove and good stuff .
1	this song ha made me feel like i am at the beach .
0	this album is not for everyone , but it is a good album to have on the shelf . i wa surprised by how good meghan trainors vocal and songwriting are , but i have nothing bad to say about the song . it is not the most unique or amazing album , but it is definitely a good album , especially if you are looking for something different .
1	how good are this album and this one !
0	i am by no mean a big fan of smooth jazz but when i saw this cd i wa really impressed . i love the way alex lacamore ha produced this album . he ha incorporated all his influence from the swing era into this album . it is more than a collection of song , it is a full blown album . the smooth jazz genre ha been around for quite some time but there are only a few artist that have been able to incorporate it to such a degree . alex lacamore ha done a great job in presenting the listener with just a little bit of everything .
0	i just love the version of this that kate sings in this video . so beautiful !
0	i love the lyric and the way the song is sung . i like the fact that it ha a child and a woman . i think that the word are very powerful . the lyric tell u that jesus love all of u . it is very encouraging . i am glad they have done this cd .
0	great cd - i like this album a lot . it ha a lot of variety and a lot of good choral music . i bought it for my granddaughter . her husband ha a small organ ( an old one ) and ha been very interested in choral music . so i thought , with this cd , it would be a good idea to get a choral cd for her and she could listen to it and learn some choral music with her husband . but , after the first two song ( i think ) , i realized that the organ sound were so distorted that it did not seem to be working for her husband . he asked me if he should stop listening to the cd .
0	just wanted to say that i love this song ! that is what i have been telling my wife for the last month . she is a big jewel fan , but refuse to listen to any new music i try to send her . i wa just trying to be nice and not tell her that i love jewel . so anyway , i wanted to tell you that you rock !
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	this album ha a lot of jazz in it . the music is good enough that you will enjoy it .
1	i am really glad i got this album . i like the beat a lot . the music is good
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	i just wanted to say i love this cd . this is not a bad cd . i am very happy with my purchase . you have a good cd .
1	i really liked this song because it fit the movie so well and it had a catchy hook .
1	the album ha a really good variety of song and i love the song .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
0	when i googled western swing , i did not come across anything i thought wa better than this . it is not too bad but it doe not fill any void in my heart . i would not recommend this cd to anyone .
1	this is a great collection of song .
0	it took me a while to get used to the album . i listened to the cd . not bad . but it wa a waste of money .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
1	thalia voice is angelic and pure . she ha an angelic presence on the stage and in the studio . the lyric are poetic and very profound . she ha a great ability to tell a story that is really interesting and make you think . the vocal are fantastic and the production is excellent .
0	i am a huge fan of meghan trainor . i have two of her album and i listen to them all the time . i do not listen to her music on the job interview or to show up to a job interview . these are thing i would like to do , but i have a huge fear that i would be judged and it would ruin my day . it is a very hard thing to deal with , but i feel like i need to be my own bos and i need to have a lot of control . this new music is a great way to deal with that . it is just different . it is a genre i have never heard before . if i had to choose one song for the job interview i would go with this song . it is just something i can relate to . this is a great tool to help you deal with the fear .
1	this is just amazing .
0	i have been a fan of the band for over 10 year , i am a sucker for good music , they are my favorite band ever , but this album is just garbage . i bought it at a record store for $ 13 and i should have bought it at the store for $ 15 , the sound quality is horrible , they use so many sample , that it make this album sound like an old cassette tape .
0	i just got this and it is really creepy .
1	this cd is good . i like the cd . but the cd is too short to play . i love the song on this cd but i just wish it wa longer . i don t think i will be buying this cd but it is worth a try .
0	i want this song back .
1	i wa thinking this might be a good album to get . but i think i may have underestimated the potential of it . the album start off with some good rockin tune and then settle into a nice swing . the first song i could really get into wa dance all night and then i got the whole album . very entertaining , but not very memorable . the only thing i would say wa that i had no idea what a smooth jazz wa . but i guess that is ok , because a lot of the other song were good .
1	i would have to say that this album is great and i would highly recommend it to people who love music . this album is great .
1	the cd ha been out for a few day and it is getting good review . the song are very good and i will be buying it . i actually have a friend who is getting one of his cd and we are both really excited about it .
0	this is a good album to listen to , there is nothing wrong with this cd , i have listened to it many time , i am just not able to understand what is on the cd , i have enjoyed the music on this cd , the lyric are good and the music is great , however , i am just not able to understand what the message is on the cd . i am not trying to be negative , i am just not able to comprehend what the message is on the cd .
1	this is a great album , i bought it for my wife and she loved it , she said it wa one of her favorite , and i did not bother with the first song , i bought the one with the word so happy and so on , i like it so much , i will listen to it again , i just wanted the clean version , and this is what i got , i do not know if it wa a mistake , but i had to buy it .
1	i bought this album back in the early 90 around the time of the great a fistful of metal cd . i found out that i had bought a copy at a thrift store and kept it from purchasing anything else . i am a huge fan and have listened to this album over and over again for the last 30 year . this is my favorite band and i would highly recommend this album .
0	i will be honest , i do not feel like i have heard meghan trainors music before , and i have only heard one song . i have to say , though , that the song are good , and the guitar playing is very good . i have listened to the song on repeat while driving and i wa impressed with how well it played along with the driving . i do not know how i am going to listen to any more of that .
0	i like the first three or four minute , but the song doe not get interesting until the chorus which is what you will hear over and over .
1	i like this version better . it ha a little more power .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest single off of furious . it wa a banger ! it wa the first song i ever downloaded ( on compact disc ! ) and i wa hooked . i would go to their web site and see if they were going to put out an album . i would even let them know that i liked their music . i wa happy to be proven wrong . the single are not bad , but the album is even worse . they had a lot of free song , but they all sound the same . they do not have any unique song . the only song that stand out is i am free but that song sound like it ha been recorded in an echo chamber . i could not listen to it for more than 5 minute . they are now selling their cd for $ 60 . i would have paid $ 12.95 per cd for this album . i would rather have gotten the cd for free . the cd are so bad that i had to buy them again . i do not have the patience to buy a cd when i can get a free mp3 of the album . if i do not like their cd i will probably stop buying cd .
0	very good .
1	this song is just right for the movie .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	i purchased the first 2 song in the collection on this one . i liked the first one but the second wa too fast for me . the third wa not that bad . i think the first 2 are better but the third one is better .
0	a beautiful song
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	this is a great place to buy cd . i bought cd from here for a long time . i like the atmosphere here .
1	i have been buying a lot of music lately , so i thought i would check this one out , and i am pleased to say i am truly not disappointed . i have been buying a lot of music lately , so i thought i would check out this one , and i am pleased to say i am truly not disappointed . this song is very well done , and the singer is very engaging . i am not sure exactly what i am expecting from this song . i am not sure i would call this a hit song , but i will certainly give this one a try . i am happy to say i am not disappointed .
1	i am currently giving my very first review to a song on this album on a mission . i am a big fan of robert plant . i bought this album on a whim after hearing robert plant song the night they drove old dutesy down on the soundtrack of the movie the avenger . i wa blown away by the album , and the rest of the album is incredible . this is a good start for a musician to take a look at , and to look back on what they have learned from their first few album .
1	this is the second album that i have purchased . the first album i purchased wa the 1965 desire album . i listened to the first few song on that album , but i wa not happy with them . i do not know if dylan knew that he wa not a good singer , but i think he should have known . i wa not too impressed with this album . i listened to this album for the first time this morning . i liked the first couple of song on the album . i wa happy about that , because i
1	my first time listening to this song and i loved it ! it is such a great song and i love the message it ha .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	this is good for meditation .
1	i like all the song on this album . i like the fact that it is not a good song , but it is still a good song . the only song that i don
1	this album wa the best album i have ever buy .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	i have not heard of this
0	i bought this album based on the artwork . i bought it because it is a hard rock album and i have a hard time deciding on the hard rock band . this album is good , but not great . i like the album a lot , but it is not great . i wish there wa more song with vocal .
0	my favorite twiztid album of all time , i also have listened to it a few time a day . i really like the production on this album , but it is just a couple of song that really stand out . new year is a great song . i am bad is a good song . bust a move is a good song , bust a move is just a good song , bust a move is a good song , why did it have to be a song about busting move ? . it is so generic it could have been recorded by anyone . the song possibility is a good song , but again , why did it have to be a song about possibility ? . it is so generic it could have been recorded by anyone , the album is just a little bit too generic . this album is great , it is just a little bit of a step down from no frill ( which wa my favorite album of all time ) .

1	this album is not all bad . it is actually the best of the four . this album ha the most song that are memorable song in my opinion . i like the song on this album the most , but i think sweet home alabama is the best song of the album . this album is a must have for parent , grandparent , and anyone who love and appreciates music .

0	this album wa not made for the mass . however , if you like the sound of the like of dr. dre , snoop dogg , and the new wave of rap , then you will love this album . i bought this album because i liked the producer name and the fact that he had worked with dre and snoop dogg before . i do not think this album is for everyone , but if you like pop rap , hip hop , and r & b , then this should be on your must have list .
1	i listened to this song on my mp3 player , and i wa surprised that her voice wasnt bad at all . i wa surprised when the song ended and the screen flashed .

0	i love the song , but i do not love the way it is performed . in the performance , the melody sound so off-key that i end up disliking the song . i can not understand why she would choose such a discordant arrangement to begin her solo . i am not sure if it is a personal preference or a recording choice that may have affected the performance . i know it is not her fault . i feel so strongly about this that i did not include this song in my review . i hope she can find a way to make it work within her unique style .

1	i have been a fan of this band since i wa 13 year old , and that wa a long time ago . i still am . for those who do not know , the band is called the last waltz and it is an all original hard cover book . i wa impressed with the band ability to write song on the guitar that sound like their playing in the recording studio . this cd is a good addition to anyones collection .
0	i bought this cd . it wa the first time i bought any cd by this group . i like the song and the singer is good .

1	i have been using this site for several year and still enjoy it .
0	this song seems to be just like any other song with 4 chord . it is got a great melody , but you need to take a lot of thing into consideration before listening to this song . first , take into consideration the song length . this song is way too long for your average listener to enjoy . secondly , you need to consider the song tempo . this song slows down at the end . lastly , you have to consider the melody . the melody in this song is very upbeat , and it ha a very catchy hook . that is it , that is all i can think of . i never realized that i just loved you is the same song a i just loved you ( until i knew you wa mine ) until i wrote this review . i will not buy this song .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !

1	there are many opinion on this song , but i am going to give it 4 out of 5 star . i think the song ha a great beat and the vocal are good . it is almost like hearing the way i feel about you but with le instrumentation .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

1	quien le toca a thalia a cantar o bailar ? thalia e una mujer desagradable con buen carácter . hay muchos conocidos de thalia y esta canción e una muy buena y una muy buena para escuchar . la voz e muy agresiva y parece que se rompe el brazo para tocar una canción . la canción parece que e de una mujer chocante y enseguida a thalia le dicen no hay nada de eso en la canción . thalia e una mujer en la televisión y radio latino . la canción e una canción en vivo . se puede ver la boca de thalia cada vez a la radio . thalia e una mujer fuera del acostumbrado , eso se ve en la canción , en la radio y en lo televisivo .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .

1	the song is very good .
0	the schubert collection wa made up of 2 cd . one of the cd ha a number of schubert piece played by the very excellent pianist peter serkin who is probably one of the finest pianist i have heard in a long time . he play the same piece over and over which make it easy to hear their beauty . the other cd is a collection of lied and ha a lot of schubert piece , of which the most memorable for me is the one by johann sebastian bach called the trout . peter sings a beautiful version of this piece and it is worth the price of the schubert cd alone . the second cd is a collection of chamber music with chamber music piece being played by the wonderful pianist , mary alice . i listened to a few piece from this cd and they were all good . i will now go back and listen to the first cd , the trout .
1	i love the way this song is sung and it fit so well with the story . it is a classic and i would encourage all of you to listen to it !

1	this is a good album but it is not the best . i agree that some song are not very good ( like strawberry wine ) but i like most of the song and would suggest that the band change their sound because this is the best they have ever sounded . i am not a big fan of country music but i enjoy the music of this band and i think they are really good .

0	i just got it yesterday . i like a lot of the song on this cd , but this is my favorite . i do not know what people are so against . it is really catchy , i like the song in the picture . the little girl singing is so cute . i like the saxophone . i like the band . i like the song in the picture . i would buy it again . it is a very good cd .
1	i have been a fan of dallas holms music since i wa a kid . i love the way he writes music and his music ha always been a favorite of mine . i will never forget him . i have been looking forward to seeing him live for a long time .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	this is the most fun thing i have ever put on my record player . i love this album .
0	i had to check out this disc because i want to see what a schubert song sounded like . i listen to a lot of schubert ; especially his piano music . this disc did not sound like anything i have ever heard before . very interesting and i wish i could find a cd of this artist before i die .

1	this song started off being a great tune for the lady , but it now ha become a typical r. kelly song that is very annoying to listen to . but the song is still good to listen to .

1	this song is a simple song , but a beautiful song . the song is about a woman on her deathbed who is concerned about the wrong thing , like the people who she is leaving behind . the lyric are very simplistic , which is a good thing a it let you focus on the word and not the music . the music is simple , but the song is beautiful . i think this song is great for a funeral service .

0	this is a good cd . the song are good and the lyric are bad . i think the cd is good , but the lyric are bad .

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

1	this is the first cd that i ever downloaded from amazon to listen to at home . i wa very impressed with what i heard . the vocal are very good and i really enjoy the cd . this is just for fun , so be prepared for some coughing , but i think it is great .
0	this wa a great song , but , for some reason , i do not like it .
1	i have enjoyed listening to this cd for many year . i am always amazed by the quality of the recording . i am very happy with this cd .
1	this album had me at wake up little susie . in fact , i would say that this is my favorite album of the bluegrass album . it doe have some great song , but i have a hard time describing the overall feel and emotion of it . i am not a fan of bluegrass so i will not be reviewing this album , but i really enjoy it .
1	the song on this album are well orchestrated by alex lacamore
0	this is one of the better song i have heard in a while . it ha a good beat and the lyric are nice .

0	i really enjoyed the album , but i think it could have been a lot better .
0	this song is too sad for me .
0	i have never liked danzig , but the first time i heard this album i had to try it . i found it to be very interesting . i like the vocal and the song structure . i think i may have to take guitar lesson .
0	this album is just ok .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	great song . i like the vocal . the lyric are good .
1	this album is perfect for the listener who want an album with a great voice . jewel is a great singer . she ha a great voice that can be heard on every song . the song breathe she sings is phenomenal . breathe is a very powerful song .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
1	this is the best song i have heard on here . i think that it is a great song . i think that it wa written very well . i think that it is good . i love it .
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .
1	lin manuel miranda and alex lacamore deserve all the credit and accolade
0	meh , it wa a good album .
0	great song , but i expected more .
0	i am not a fan of this band . i am not sure why . i mean , they are good musician , their lyric are catchy , but i just do not like them . i do not know who they are or what they are even about . i do not really know why . i mean , i know they have talent , but i do not like the musicianship or the lyric of this band . i guess i just do not like them . i hope they find their way back to me .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	the music is great , but the lack of production quality just really put this album down .
0	i got this for my son for christmas and he said that it wa his favorite western swing cd
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .
1	this is one of eminems better album . it ha a lot of classic and hip hop song a well a a couple of pop song . it is very unique .
0	this is a very good album ( for a thrash album ) , but it is not the best album of the year for me . it is one of the best album that i have heard in a long time and it show that they are going back to their root . however , i would not recommend this album to anyone if you like master of puppet or the blackout . i would also recommend this album to anyone who is not a fan of giant or master of puppet .
0	i bought this album by mistake . i would never buy a clean version of an album by lil wayne . so , make sure it is the real deal .
1	this is a great album and thalia is a great singer .
1	this is a nice change of pace from the rest of the album he is released . i enjoyed it .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	i like the song , but it definitely doe not sound like a white stripe song .
0	this is one of my favorite hip-hop album . the best song on the album are bodak yellow and who you be . the rest of the song are okay .
0	wa really looking forward to hearing this on realease , but it is just awful . i want my money back .
1	this is a very good , positive album . the first cd i ever bought from danzig wa an issue one . i have since bought all the others . i love the guitar arrangement and the song are great . i feel that the best album of this group can be found on the danzig box set .
1	this cd is very good !
1	this album ha got to be one of the best hip hop album of all time . first off , this album really take hip hop to a whole new level . it take hip hop from the underground and give it a new way of listening . it is like a breath of fresh air for hip hop . it take the music from the street , underground and make it mainstream and give it a new style of music . it is hip hop all in one album . i have listened to this album for hour . it is an amazing album . it is a great album , and i would have to say that this is one of the best album of the year . i would definately recommend this album to anyone who love hip hop . it really is a must listen to . i recommend it to everyone . it is an amazing album . i have to say after listening to this album , that i am very glad that i got it . it is definitely a must have for any hip hop fan , and i would definitely recommend this album to anyone . this album is great and i would recommend it to anyone . this really is a great album . a must listen to for anyone who enjoys hip hop . it really is a great album . i think it is a great album . a must , but not a must have if you are just new to hip hop . i think this album is great . i would definately recommend it to anyone . i think that this album is a great way to start hip hop . this really is a great album . it is a great album and
1	the music is incredible . i had to turn it off because i wa dancing around the house in the living room for hour .
1	i have only listened to this cd a few time , and i really enjoyed it . i like the harmony . the song are well sung . i really liked the music and the rhythm . the cd is well-mixed and well-produced . the only thing that i did not like wa that it is hard to sing along in the beginning .
0	nothing special , i would say , but at least it is not awful .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	love this cd . i own many cd . this is my second cd . i have purchased all of them .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	this song sucked . it wa so boring and just did not make me want to dance around the room .
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
0	i really purchased this cd for the one track let the worshiper arise . this song wa so lovely , and the holy spirit is me loved this song , because it is a story of the worshiper coming in , and the worshiper coming into the worshiper and worshipping , and that they are going to worship to the worshiper , and worship is about the worshiper , and worshiper worship to the worshiper , and then eventually the worshiper will worship the worshiper . so it is really about the worshiper coming into the worshiper and then they are going to worship the worshiper , so i really enjoyed this song , it wa beautiful , and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him .
1	i loved this song and i wa really looking forward to this realease . i wa glad i did not buy this one when i wa just learning to play . just listen to it and you will know what i mean .
1	i like most of the song on this cd and the music is good . i would give this cd 5 star if i could .
1	i really think this is a great movie . the soundtrack ha great song .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	i can not wait for the next release .

0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

0	this song is such a mess . i have a hard time listening to it .
0	i am not sure if this wa meant to be a cover or not .
0	this is by far the best album of the year for me . i would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a pure power metal album . i can honestly say that if you like power metal and you like giant and oblivion , then this is a good album .
0	i have listened to this cd on the way to and from work for the past two week . it ha been a blessing to me . i always enjoy attending church and listening to music , but i have listened to this cd more than i have listened to any other cd in the past year . it is a wonderful cd and i have gained more than i ever thought possible . it ha helped me to grow spiritually . i have been able to take the time to pray , and to listen to music that ha helped me to hear god . i have been able to enjoy the music and the people that i have met . i can not imagine not having this cd . it is a wonderful gift and i will continue to listen to it .

0	the cd is awesome and the music is wonderful .
0	i have been listening to this cd for the past 7 day and i just have not been able to get past the horrible music . it appears that the vocal and the music are the same , but the cd is not .

1	i have a few cd of your music , and i love them ! this one is my favorite . it is a very good cd . i do not know how you can make such a great cd in such a short time frame . i have been listening to your cd for a few month now and i am still enjoying all of them . i love that the song are new and that you can mix the song for each person .
1	this cd is not my favorite , but it is very enjoyable . i have been a fan of the band for a long time .
1	this is my first time buying an album and i am very pleased with the music . i have purchased several album from amazon and this is by far my favorite . i wa shocked to find that the album wa only 99 cent and i have not been disappointed yet . i got it for $ 8.99 and will be purchasing more .
0	i am feeling all that the album say you should and the lyric that i can understand . i hope this will help some people that are listening to this album for the first time to get it , for it is one of the best one i have heard in a long time .
1	this is my favorite song .
0	i have listened to this album about 20 time , and it is still great . i like the song on this album . it is very unique to listen to . i like how different some of the song are . i am surprised it is so different from title because it really is . i have only listened to title a couple of time and i did not really get what this album wa talking about . i mean title is different , but this album is different . the song are different , the style are different , and the genre are different . i am not really a fan of rap , but i am not a fan of pop either . when i listen to this album , the song are very repetitive , but the repetition is part of the unique style of the song . the other thing that i do not like about this album is that it doe not really have any new lyric . it ha about 7 song that have lyric , and the rest are just the repetitive music . the only good thing about this album is that it is a great party album .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i would give this a 4 out of 5 star , but the only reason i rated it 5 out of 5 is because , because there are so many great song on here !

0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .

0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	i believe trey songz is one of the best rapper out there right now . his first album the way you move ha some of the best beat on the rap scene . i am very impressed with his music and am hoping he will be the next kanye .
1	the only reason i have it is because of the good review i have read and the fact that i needed it for christmas , so i figured i would give it a try . so far , it is a good buy , even though my wife is very skeptical of my musical taste .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !

1	i have been a fan of the band since the 90 , and the song have always been a part of my life . i wa really happy with the way this cd came out . it wa a good album , and i enjoyed it a lot .
0	this is a good album for a couple of reason : 1 ) it is not a bad album . 2 ) the cover art is cute and interesting . 3 ) the song is good . 4 ) the song are good . 5 ) the album is good . 6 ) the price is good . 7 ) the length of the song is good . 8 ) the music video is a good clip . the only thing that really annoyed me is the fact that the song are all titled the same . each track is entitled i do not wan na know or i do not wan na know or i do not wana know and the song themselves are pretty much the same . if i would have noticed this before buying this album , i would have not bought it and i would have been the winner .
1	this song wa really good . it fit the theme of the movie .
1	i do not know if you guy realize this , but this is actually one of the best band i have ever heard ( i know a lot of people do not like this band , but i am actually a fan ) . this is a killer band and i am glad they have had the chance to make many album . great job to all the guy involved . love you guy !

0	i have never liked any of the ozzies album but this one i have to admit i did not give it a chance . i wa not expecting much , but i wa very pleasantly surprised with the effort put into this album . i will give it a 4. the song are good and there are some decent cover version . however , the album best asset is it quality of production . ozzies music is just all over the place and this is no exception . i will be waiting for the next album . it will be worth the wait .
1	this song is from the album the blackest of the black . i have listened to this song many time and it is amazing ! if you are a christian listen to this song .
1	i absolutely love this song . i can not wait to see if it sell well . i hope so .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	not the best new music i have heard but still a nice change from the old stuff .
0	this song really got my attention .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .
0	first off i am going to get a little off topic . i have to say that i have never had a band that i actually respected . i always thought that band were overrated and there wa not a lot of good band . the reverb band is one of the best band i have ever seen . i have liked them for year . i think that the band is good in the studio and live . i did not enjoy the cd . i do not like the cd . i do not know what the band would have been like if they had not broken up . i thought the cd wa really good . i think they are really good in the studio and live .
0	i have listened to this album twice over the past 10 day . i think twiztid ha a good voice , but it is really not what i am into . i wa into the mid 2000s but since then i have listened to more hardcore . i really do not listen to this type of music because it is not my thing . but i really like this album .
1	i am a music fan and have been since i wa a child . i have a cd collection that includes over 1000 cd . i am a music fan and love listening to new music . i am a music fan and love listening to new music .

0	one of the most beautiful opera i have ever heard .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	i have listened to this album over the course of a week . it is a great cd . the lyric are fun and well-written . the music is very good , especially the saxophone . i believe that the singer ha a really nice voice . the song are well-written . i am not sure that they are very good . the production is good , but the arrangement is good , too . the guitar playing is not that good . i have never heard a live version of let the worshiper arise ( the original song ) and i am not sure that it is a great show tune .
1	i have bought a lot of song from amazon , but this is by far the best .
1	this is a terrific cd filled with excellent music . most of the song are familiar to me . i enjoy music from many different period , era , and genre , and this collection is no exception . the best thing i can say about this cd is that it show that there is always a lot of great music to be found- and a great deal of it is right here in the u.s. i really like it . it seems to me there is a lot of great music out right now , and that much good music still need to be written , but this cd show that there is still a lot of music to be written .
0	i do not know what i am going to do with my life . the only reason i got this cd wa because i love the music . i hope that someone come up with a good idea/concept for me and i am not forced to become a clown . i think the fact that this is only ten song is what i am going to miss from this band . i hope they are still in the game . i hope they do not die . i hope they get back together . i hope that they are still alive . what the hell do i know ?
0	i like the music on this cd . it is not very much like the other cd i have heard . i am not sure if the song are by the same person or not . i have listened to this cd for a while and i have to say it is a very good cd . i am going to get a cd from this artist .
1	i bought this cd because it wa on sale . i wa surprised to find out it wa a clean version of the cd ( it wa the same album a the cd i had on my old cd player

1	i bought it , and it is good .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	the cd ha some great song . i bought the cd because i wanted all of the song . i now have the complete album . i wish i had bought the cd with all of the song that were not on the cd . it is a great cd , but it doe not have all of the song that were not on the cd . i wish it had all the song .

0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	i bought this album to start with , but i am very glad i got it . the recording is very good and the musicianship is very good . the music is very nice and very different from other orchestra that are playing music of this genre . the musicianship of the orchestra is very good and the music is very pleasant . the song are very nice , and of course the conductor is very good . the only thing i do not like about this album is that it is too long . i would recommend to buy it if you are interested in this genre of music .

0	i purchased this cd because after listening to many choral cd that i have , i wa curious to see what the best cd of the genre were . a it turn out , the guy on this cd are not the best in the genre . their song are more on the light side of the spectrum and the song are quite boring .

0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	first of all , i think that he is a very talented singer and i love his voice . i do not like his voice when he sings in the background , but i have to admit , that it is very good when he is singing in the main part of the song . i have heard him sing on other cd and they are very good , but i thought that he is just not a singer . he is very good at writing song but he is also very good at singing , but he doe not have the voice , he doe not sound like a singer , but he ha a very good voice , but he doe not have the voice , he doe not sound like anything really and that is why i think he is not a singer . i do not know why everyone doe not like his song , and i do not know what is wrong with them , but they do not sound very good . it is a very good singer , i think , but i do not think he is a singer .
1	i can not put into word how much i love this song . i just could not stop listening .
1	i like the way the song is played . it is well done . the instrumentation is great . the vocal are great . it is definitely a great song .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	i would say this album is better then the first one . the 2nd is better than the first one . the 3rd is better than the first one .
0	this song is a perfect example of how the songwriter are able to take a good song and turn it into something that is mediocre .
0	i bought the cd when i went to the music store and asked the clerk for the cd . he asked me how many song i wanted and i said 5 so he put the cd in my shopping cart . he asked me which group i wanted to hear for the money and i said the manhattan transfer and he said i have nothing for them . i told him i heard them on the radio so i wanted to hear them . he said oh i have no idea what they are . i told him i wa looking for a group and he said how many song you want to hear ? i said 5 and he took the cd out of my shopping cart and said ok , i have no idea what you want to hear . he said well you will have to buy everything you want to hear . i told him i could buy all the song i wanted so he said he would get me a cd for the money . i got his name and address so i could keep the cd and give it to him if i ever bought anything on it from him .
0	this is one of the better song on the album . the song is decent , but the vocal performance is not very good .
1	great album . i would highly recommend this album .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	i love jewel . i bought the cd to give the boy at work a listen . they loved it . i think it wa the first cd they ever bought . when i started listening to her music i discovered she is very talented . i would love to hear her sing again .
1	i have always enjoyed this song and have always thought that it fit at least in the top ten . it is a good song for a happy happy mood . i would recommend this song to anyone .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	this album is amazing . great song . i listen to this album all the time . i have a hard time putting this album down . it make me happy every time i hear it .
0	i found this collection to be quite disappointing . there are a few really good song ( the one where you can hear her voice change ) and there are a few others that i did not like at all . i also found a few song that are not in the original set that i like better . i have listened to this a few time and i am still not sold on it . i have also tried to find out when the cd wa released and there wa no info . on the amazon site . i will continue to listen to this cd and i will continue to buy other itunes music ( which are usually a better quality for the money ) .
0	i have listened to this album 3 time now and i have to say i like it a lot . a lot ! it is the best thing that jewel ha ever done .
1	the song are good on this cd .
0	i like the song but i can not get past the lyric . i do not like this song .
0	i have been hearing this band for a few year . their sound is really nice , but they are overrated .
1	looked up this song off the good wife . it an empowering song and really fit the theme of the movie !
0	i bought this cd at a yard sale . i am very glad i did . it is been on my car stereo for the past 20 year . i listen to it a i drive to work . there are a few different song on this cd , but the song that ha been on my car stereo the longest is i love you . i have always loved this song , and it sound like you can tell the song is from the 1960s . i would highly recommend this cd if you like the 1960s .
0	i liked this song , but the last 4 line are a little too much .
1	i love the song , i have bought it many time , and i am always amazed at how this song ha been covered so many different way . i love the lyric and the music .
0	if you like folk music in general , this album will be a nice choice . if you are looking for a group that play their own music , i would not advise this . the music on this album is good , but the sound quality is not very good . the album is worth buying , but it would be better to go with another collection of folk music . i would recommend this to fan of the trout , but not to fan of folk music in general .
1	this song will make you cry .
0	i just can not get into this song . i just can not . i do not like it .
0	this is a good song , but do not bother with the clean version .
0	i could not stand this song . i am a big fan of dallas holm , but i really do not like this song . i can understand why it wa a hit , but if i can not stand it , then i really do not know what to say about it .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i love this cd . it is very entertaining and very well sung . i am very happy with this purchase and will purchase the cd next week !
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !

1	i listened to this album while driving back and forth from work to home and it wa really a nice relaxing listening experience . i love the music and the choral arrangement are great . the lyric are great and the album is well worth the price of the cd . the only negative thing i can say is that the album is very repetitive . i would recommend this album to anyone who like choral music .
1	this song is a perfect introduction to the album . the music is soothing .

1	the second album is a little more of an improvement ( in my opinion ) , but it is still a good album . the song still have their individual characteristic while at the same time being a little bit more cohesive .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

0	i do not know why i do not like this cd . it just doe not do it for me . i like some of the song but i just do not like the whole cd .
0	wow , i love the music , but the cd is a bit of a disappointment . i have to be honest , i do not expect them to be a hit , but i wa hoping for at least a few song of my choosing .
1	i liked the song , but i did not see the movie
1	the first time i listened to this opera , i thought the whole thing wa a bit too long and did not know where to begin . i wa wrong , the singing wa terrific and the orchestration were incredible . this album is a must for any serious opera fan .
0	i thought that this album wa great , but i do not think it is worth the price that i paid for it . this album is too much overproduced . the song were good , but the sound of the recording wa a little too much , and i did not care for the sound of the guitar . i just wish that they would have left the vocal alone .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .

1	i love this cd . very enjoyable .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	the song on this cd are an absolute joy to listen to ! i just love them . even the song that are supposed to be new just blow me away . i really hope you can continue to write new song . i would love to hear them all . thanks for the cd !
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
1	this is a really good album .
1	i really like this album . i really like the flow and the beat are really tight . i think the beat on this album are much better than they were on all eyez on me . the flow is better on this one . the beat are very tight and the beat on this album are very tight . the production on this album is very solid . the production on this album is actually quite good . this is a great album . this is a very good example of how two different producer can work together . this is a very good example of how two different producer can come together and make a great album but i really do not like this beat . i really like the beat that i heard on this album , but i do not like the beat on this album . this is not a bad album , but this is not the greatest album from madlib and dr. dre .
0	it is great to buy a cd that you think is going to be a great investment . when it is not , you discover to your chagrin that the cd is not a good a you thought it wa .
0	a friend of mine is convinced that i am listening to the most beautiful , most romantic piece of music . in her opinion , these are the best love song ever written . she ha never listened to this album so i am not sure how she arrived at this conclusion . i listened to this disc in her car a she drove me home from work . i wa so very impressed with the lyric . i had never thought of that before . the song are all very romantic and the harmony are beautiful . but the only problem is that the song do not really have a flow . the song are very short and i do not think i can take them all in one sitting . the only thing i can say about the music is that it is very pretty . i do not think it is very good , but the lyric are very pretty and the music is very pretty . if only they were available in a higher quality cd . i would give it a 4 star rating .
0	i have always loved the music of this group , and i think this album really show what they are all about . this album is the first real hip hop album that i have ever heard . this album is the most important album that i have ever heard that ha changed my life .
1	this is a true masterpiece . i am sure it is not the best album around but it is the best that i have ever had . i would rather listen to this album than watch the matrix .
1	i bought this album because of all the wonderful review here . i bought this album because of all the wonderful review here . i do not know , but i am glad that i did ! i have been listening to ray benson since the early 80 , when my sister introduced me to his tape . this album will be played at our christmas gathering forever !
1	i bought this album to listen to while watching the game in the kitchen . i really enjoyed the album . i liked the music . i thought the lyric were good . i thought the artist wa great . i just did not like the album . i thought it wa very disappointing . i like the album . i just think meghan is an amazing artist . i did not like the album . i thought it wa a bit disappointing . i wa disappointed . i just wanted to like the album . i just wanted to like meghan so much that i bought it . i just wanted to like her so much that i bought the cd . i just wanted to like her so much that i bought the album . i just wanted to like her so much that i bought the cd . i just wanted to like her so much that i bought the record . i just want to like her so much that i bought the record . i just wanted to like
0	this is an amazing album and it is the best album that eminem ha made so far . it ha the best song ever and it is on of the best album he ha ever made .
0	this is a good song for a change . it is a really good song , but i wish it would play with a little more life in it .
1	i am looking for an upbeat , happy song to listen to after a hard day work , which is exactly the kind of thing this album delivers . i do not know if you have ever heard of this album , but i think you should . it is called the good wife and is one of the best cd i have ever owned . it is really good . the only thing i would say is that some of the lyric are a little repetitive . i would give this album five star if i had five star and i would recommend it to anyone who like happy , upbeat song .
0	i bought these song because they are all on the internet . i got them a a christmas present for my boyfriend and he loved them .
1	this song is the best version of the song . i love the original version . i love this version of the song . this song is fantastic . i love it .

1	this song is great . i really like the song and the beat is nice .
1	i love to listen to this band .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	a very fine album . the best album of the year .
1	this is one of the best blue album i have ever heard . i am very impressed . it is very well done . i would not hesitate to purchase this cd .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
1	if you can find a good record store with reasonable price , you are in luck . i stumbled across one in the bronx that ha a great selection . and since i am from the bronx , i got a better deal than most tourist do who go to the big apple for their holiday shopping . : )
0	this song is a complete rip off of the beatles song and your bird can sing , and it is sung by a female . i have no idea who the artist are , and i can not find the song anywhere , a far a i know . i do not really care . the song is awful , and it sound like they ripped off a song called i think i am going bald , which is a great song , but not one suitable for christmas . i would not pay for this song , and if i ever find out who the artist is , i will let you know .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	this is the best oldie album i have ever heard . this is just a great tribute to the old and great song that were great in the past . the cover art , the liner note , the music , the feel , the presentation , and the overall experience of listening to it is just perfect .
0	i bought my wife this cd for christmas . we loved it . she really enjoyed it , and so did i. i did not like the cover art , and the track listing , but overall , we loved this cd , and we hope to take lesson with the singer , cyney davis , in the future .
1	i wa expecting this album to be horrible , but it is actually pretty good .
1	this song is not my favorite on the album , but i really like the first part of the album .
0	the first time i listened to this song wa with my grandpa and it brought back memory of my childhood . now i just can not stand to listen to it . i do not know how to describe it , i just wish i did not hear it .
0	this album is about a good a a three-hour show of bad movie . i can not believe this is being reviewed a a good album . i mean , what wa the last album that you heard that wa not boring ? if anything , this album is boring . and it ha boring music . that is why it is not going to get much attention , i think .
1	nice collection . i really like that there are not too many song that are really long or are long in the middle . it is a nice collection in that it ha a variety in the song . it is nice to have a collection that doe not have the same song repeated over and over again .
0	this is one of my favorite song that i have ever heard in my life . this is one of those song that will make you think that you are hearing a different band . it is such a unique sound that is not exactly what i am used to . it is got that deep , heavy , and heavy vibe going on . this song is a good one to listen to from time to time , but i would recommend getting this album if you are a fan of indie and folk type song .
0	i am a huge fan and i have been a fan since the beginning . i have been a fan since about the time the first release wa released . i have been a fan since about the time the first release came out but i wa in a weird place then and i did not really care that much if i liked it or not . i used to be a fan of sod . now i am a fan of the new version of sod . i am a fan of all the original member . i am a fan of the new member . i like the new version of sod best because i like the original more . i like the new version of sod the best . i did not like the new sod the first time around . i liked the new sod once the first album came out i liked this version . i have liked sod since the first release but i did not like the first release . the first release wa a let down . the first release wa a disappointment . i have been a fan since the first release . i am a fan of all the original member . i like the new member the best . i have liked sod since the first release but i didn like the first release . the first release wa a let down .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
1	i think i just discovered a new artist . i love this album .

1	this is one of the best album of the 90 . this is the first time that i have heard the song when johnny come marching home and it wa the first time that i fell in love with the song . i would love to hear what his version would sound like . i believe that this album is one of the best album ever , and this is the first time that i have heard the song when johnny comesmarching home and it wa the first time that i fell in love the song .
1	very enjoyable . the song are catchy and the performance are just great .
0	i just received the ray benson cd hang on in the mail . it is just excellent !
1	i love this band . i saw them in dc last fall . they were amazing . i just did a double-double with them . i also played with them at their house the first time i saw them . then , i played with them at the blue squirrel on new year eve . they are very talented musician and they play the music i love . i am going to buy their next cd .
1	i have not listened to this cd yet , but i have to say i really like what i hear . the song are really good and the album flow well . i am only a little disappointed that the cd doe not come with all the instrument that were featured in the song . i will have to listen to the rest of the song and decide if i will buy the album , or not .
0	a great album . the voice is outstanding , and the arrangement are very good to . i love it when you can find song that are so good that you do not even need to hear them on the radio . the music is good , but the singing is a little on the mature side .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	i am a huge fan of this artist and have bought almost every album they have made . this cd is my favorite of their cd . i love the fact that this artist is able to mix bluegrass and hip-hop together in an unique way and they have it down pat . they are in my opinion in a class of their own when it come to how well they can do something . i am very impressed with their latest project and i can not wait to see what they have in store for u next .
1	i really enjoyed this album , it is a very good album . i bought it for my husband a a birthday present , and it wa a great gift . i also bought it for my child , but it did not work out .
1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
0	[ a very negative review . ]
0	this is probably the best song in the group catalog . it is my favorite song and i like it so much that i will add it to an audio book soon .
0	i have been looking for schubert liebeslieder cd for a very long time . i really like this cd . i thought it would be a good introduction to schubert , but i wa not a impressed with the cd a i expected to be .
0	i do not usually buy classical music , but i thought this album wa worth the price of admission .
0	the album is definitely a good one . unfortunately , i have a problem with the song , and the cd wa a mess . this is the second cd that i have sold that i have had to throw away . just hope i can find the cd in another store .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	i really enjoyed this song . i thought it wa very catchy and catchy but i also thought they overdid it a little bit too much . i thought it wa better than any of the other song out now . i will give it a thumb up .
0	this is a terrible album . i do not like this album at all .
1	i like it .
1	this is a great album i would recommend to anyone . it is the first time i have heard any new twiztid material . it is really good .
1	this is an old song , but i always liked it and i am glad i found it . i can hear what they are saying in the song .
0	this is a good album , not a great or bad album .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	i really like this album . the beat are great , the beat are just out of this world . i have not listened to it in a while , but i will definitely get this one again . i love the song , and i love how it flow .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

1	what can your say about this album , it is casting crown . love it !
0	i have listened to this song over and over and over again . i just can not get into it . for the first time in my life i have a song that is just not for me . i do not listen to rap and this song is too much for me to listen to . i have listened to a lot of music this year and i can only listen to one song . this song is just too much for me . i have been listening to a lot of music and i only listen to certain song . i do not know why i can not get into this song . i just can not . this is a good song but i do not care for it . i would never get a new cd because i have listened to this song over and over . i would never buy it on cd and i would never listen to it . i think if i wa to buy it i would wait to buy it on cd . i do not think i would get that sick of it .
0	this is a very touching piece of music . it is beautiful , but also sad and haunting . i have been fortunate enough to live in the area of new orleans where this piece wa first performed and have never been disappointed .
0	the song are good , but the worst song of the album is the last song on the album , i believe in you . there are no word , just a short scream that could be heard anywhere . the only thing that really make this album is the fact that it is a compilation album . i mean come on , it is an 80 year old man singing on an 80 year old man voice . this is a collection of song that i did not like the first time around . i like them now , but some of them were not when i first heard them . i think that there are some song that i like and some song that i can not stand . i do not know what it is about this album . it is just not my cup of tea .
0	in general i think this is a good record , but in this song i do not think it is good . i am still not sure if i like this song . it is a good song , but i do not think it is good .
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold up in these day , but it is still like i remembered .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	this album sound like a cross between a great album by bob marley . and a great album by nirvana .
0	it is okay . would listen again if i wa bored .
0	there is not a lot of difference between a western and a western film except for the dialogue . the dialogue is the same . and the music is the same . i have heard the song from both cowboy and lonesome dove and i can honestly say that this western is a lot better than it counterpart . from the opening theme to the end , i wa entertained . i only wish they would have let the music in the movie be the same a the song .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	this cd is very enjoyable , but i wish it came with a booklet of lyric , because that is what i needed to understand the lyric .
1	i like this song . it is not that bad , it is just not that good . i really like it . i really like it because it is different and it is just a good song . it is not that it is boring , it is just not that good . it is not that it is generic , it is not that good . it is not that boring , it is not that good . it is not that it is just generic , so i have to put it in my not buy-able category . it is not that it is boring , it is not that good . it is not that it doe not have a good beat , it is not that good . it is not that it

0	great album . very good for the price .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	i like the band . i like this song . i like the sax player .
1	this album ha a great message .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	this is an excellent cd . i have been listening to it nonstop the whole time i have it . the cd is a keeper .
0	i love the music from this cd , however , the lyric are just lame .

1	a good , good song .
0	i got this cd by mistake . it is a good cd , but a few of the song have been played by other artist . i do not usually like cd with bonus track , but in this case they do work . the bonus track is a good song , but it is the only song that wa recorded prior to the release of the cd . i recommend this cd to anyone that like to listen to music . this cd doe have a few bonus track . there are a few song that are a bit cheesy , but most of the song are good . the song i listen to are one that i normally will not get the chance to hear . i have a cd with bell & whistle and i have got you by johnny mathis that i bought on a whim .

1	i really liked ray benson in 1988-1990 on the radio station kkda in sacramento , ca . ray wa a great song writer . ray benson in sacramento wa the only station that played ray bensons song on the air . i have been listening to ray benson since that time and i have to say , he is one of the best western swing artist i have ever heard . ray is a true west coast artist and we lost a great one today . a great artist and a great person . rip ray .
0	i liked this song a lot ! it wa a good change from most of the other song i listened to .

0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	the album is just okay , but the song are good . it is the lyric that get me . just the wrong type of lyric . i would rather listen to a song with more lyric then to a song with just a few line of lyric like the best time of my life is when you are here .

1	i have only heard a couple of album from this band and i would have to say that this album is my favorite . i have to say that it is one of the best album i have ever heard . this is the best album of the new bluegrass group from boston .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	just what i needed for a rainy day . i am a classical music fan , but this is the first cd that is not just classical music , but also a little more pop oriented . it is very relaxing , but not something i would listen to everyday . i am going to keep listening to it .

0	i have really enjoyed the album , and i have been listening to it all the time .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .

1	this song ha a positive message .
0	i wa really hoping that this album would be a better purchase than it wa . i wa right .
0	i like the sound of this album but it is kind of repetitive .
0	there are a couple of thing that i liked about this album . the first is that the song are very well-written and well-sung . the second is that the album contains some different style . the guitar are of a somewhat different style from the other song . these are the kind of song that i like . the vocal are of a different style from the other song . i like a different vocal style . it is good to have variety in your music .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

1	i have not listened to this album until now . i am really enjoying it . i do not know what the controversy really is about , but i am glad that i have gotten a hold of this album . i may not like the lyric , but the beat are really good on this album . i like the classical music on here a lot . the song on here are all good . all of them except for the first one . the first one is just horrible . it is just a really weak song , but the beat are really good on the first song , so i
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .

1	the first time i heard this song . i wa so moved , i bought the album . i wa thinking.how can i ever find a song that is so good , that make me cry . it wa a great song .
0	the song is so boring , it is painful to listen to and make me feel guilty for having fun . the song is such an example of a good song that is actually about the same thing over and over . it is so boring . i have never thought about it this way before .

1	i am a fan of robert johnson . his song are the soundtrack to my life for the past 25 year . i love his voice , his guitar , his song and his soul . i am so grateful for the song he is written , and the song that he is inspired me to write . i have been following robert johnson since i wa about 15 year old , and i wa always intrigued by his song . i wa always captivated by the lyric that he put to his song . when i wa 20 year old and living in london , i began to seek out his music . the man that i found wa robert johnson . his music wa different from anything i had ever heard before . i wanted to know more about him , so i began to search out his web site , and i began to learn more about his life , his music , his music career , his family , his politics , his wife , his child , his life . i wa so intrigued by his story , and i wanted to learn more about him . i began to write letter to robert johnson . letter that he wrote to me back , which i still have today . i wa excited to find out that robert johnson wa still alive and that he wa now the president of the robert johnson foundation , which is located in chicago . i wa so excited to find out that he wa still alive , and that he had started an organization that wa designed to help others who were in need of a helping hand . i wanted to donate to this organization , and i wa so excited to find out that robert johnson wa still alive , and that he wa now the president of this organization . i wanted to learn more about him , and i wanted to learn more about robert johnson . i wanted to follow his tour schedule , and i wanted to learn more about his music career , his music history , his music philosophy , and his music career . i wanted to learn more about him , and i wanted to listen to his music , and i wanted to hear his music in his word a he wrote his song . i wanted to hear his music , and i wanted to learn about him and his music . i wrote many letter to robert johnson . i would get hundred and hundred of letter from robert johnson . i would get letter telling me what he would do for me , what he would say to me , what he would do for me . i would get letter from robert johnson telling me what he would do for me . i would get letter telling me how he changed my life . i would get letter telling me that he would do anything for me . i would get letter telling me that he would give his life for me . i would get letter telling me that he would do anything for my family . i would have letter from robert johnson telling me how he would be . i would have letter telling me that he wa . i would have letter telling me that he wa . i never received a letter telling me that he wasnt . i never received a letter telling me that he wasnt .

0	i have to say i really enjoy meghan trainors music . i think it is very unique , i enjoy the more alternative rock/pop/soul style . she writes beautiful song with a strong voice . i love the way she sings . it is natural . i am not a huge fan of her last album , but i did enjoy her new one . i have listened to it several time and i really enjoyed it . i am sure a lot of people have already given it a negative review , but i think it is a great album ! i really liked it ! i will still buy her cd though . i still can not get it out of my head . i hope she tour again .

0	this is a very good classical music album . the sound quality is excellent . there is not very much information on the cd . the music is enjoyable . there are a few weak point . the chorus are very repetitive . the music is very repetitive and there is no diversity or originality to it . the sound is not very good . there are only two good track on this album and the rest of the album is not worth listening to .

0	i love eminem . i am glad i bought the album . i like the lyric and the chorus . i do not think he is the best rapper , but he is good .
0	they all are the same . they are all the same . so predictable . i do not like the rap song . i do not like any of them . they all sound the same , and there is just nothing special about them . i do not know . i am going to get this album and just try to forget about it .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .

0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	this cd is very hot but i bought this cd because of the title and the artist , mr. revel . this cd is filled with a good mixture of blue , rock and jazz . there are plenty of fast song and slow song that go along with this cd . i bought this cd because of the title and the artist , mr. revel . this cd is filled with a good mixture of blue , rock and jazz . there are plenty of fast song and slow song that go together to make this cd a complete package . the vocal are good , the instrument are very good , and the lyric are good . overall this cd is a good one that is worth buying .

0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	i have been a fan of the beastie boy since they were a five-piece . i do not know where i have been since then . i listen to a lot of punk and new wave and rap music but rarely hear the beastie boy . i wa at a show in detroit and saw a group that i wa familiar with , the b-52 . they had a set and after the show the girl i wa with and two of the guy decided to go to the bathroom together . i wa shocked to see the b-52 were still there . the girl looked at me with this weird look on her face and said , i have a new boyfriend . i wa so embarrassed and said , why would you have a new boyfriend ? you have been dating him since you were a kid or something . she said , no , he is the boyfriend of the girl i am seeing . i said , what ? you guy are gay ? she said , no , he is the boyfriend of the girl who is seeing me . i said , what ? that doe not make any sense . she said , no , it make perfect sense . she ha been seeing me since she wa 14 and he ha been dating her since he wa 18 so why would they have been together since they were kid ? i laughed and said , it doe not make any sense . the guy she had been dating since she wa 14 and the guy she had been dating since he wa 18. i said , you guy are gay ? they said , no , we are not gay . we just broke up . it is a long story . i said , well it would make a lot more sense if we were straight . he would be the dad and you would be the mom . at least that would make sense . you guy are gay . that would make a lot more sense . i said , you guy are gay ? they said , no , we are not gay . we just broke the relationship up . i said , well , it would make a lot more sense if we were straight . they said , well , it is a long story . i said , well , it would make a lot more sence if we were straight . i asked them if they had a boyfriend or if they were just hanging out . they said , no , we are not gay . i said , well , it would make a lot more sane sence if we were straight . i said , you guy are gay ? they said , no , we are not gay . we just broke the relationship up . it is a long story .

1	this is a really good song .
1	i wa looking for jazz music and after listening to this album i wa hooked . it is everything i needed to listen to . if you find the band you will really like this album .
1	this is a really beautiful soprano - a really beautiful voice and very good in the recording . the instrumentation is excellent . very nicely recorded . the performance were excellent . this is one of the most beautiful recording of this soprano available . she is also a joy to listen to .
1	i saw this album at an open air concert that wa put on by the local radio station . i listened to the whole album to find out who the singer is and i found out that it is a great album . the only reason i gave it 2 star instead of one is because the background voice are distracting .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
1	this is a very cool book , i will definitely recommend it to the rest of my family
1	i have been listening to this song every morning for the past few week now . not that i think i need to hear this song every morning but i do listen to it . it is a great song .
1	my first purchase on amazon , and i am pleased . it is definitely worth the few extra buck .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	this music is awesome .
1	i am so glad i got this cd ! i love it !
0	i am a very big fan of the opera of mozart and wagner . when i first heard this album i thought it wa wonderful . however , after listening to it on my car radio for a few day i realized that i had been misled .
0	i have never heard her cd , but i have heard her perform before . i can not say that i like her voice , but i can say that i like the sound of her singing .
0	this wa my first time downloading a song and i felt like i got a good deal on it , so i ordered it right away . the song is awful . the writer should be ashamed of themselves .
0	i do not know . i am not a music snob , i just not know . i can say without hesitation that this recording is a must have
1	i
1	schubert schubert is full of beauty .
1	this cd is very good . it contains many song that i have never heard before . i love it .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	i have never been a fan of danzig . i have listened to his first five album , and i have to say that this is his best . i have also listened to his first six album and i think that this is his best . i have also listened to the entire box of delight box set , and i think that this is the best of the entire series . the music is very fast and ha a very heavy metal sound . i would recommend this album to any fan of danzig .
1	love this album !
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
1	this is a very good album . a lot of great song , and i love the music .
0	: meh , i did not like it .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	this is a cd of mostly symphony ( and a few concerto ) by schubert . the cd is not of high quality . the cd is in the same plastic case a i have had in the past . the cd is in the top half of the box , with the rest of the cd and the booklet .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	this is awesome . i just purchased the cd . i love the song . this is great . i am looking forward to the cd that is coming out .
0	i just found this song , and it is just a song i can sing . i do not know who wrote this song , but it seems to be about a relationship or something . i do not know .
1	this song really made me feel good , but i am not really sure why .
0	i wa disappointed with this cd . it wa a shame to see a music group which i love , only have half of it . i am disappointed that i wasnt able to give the whole cd a listen .
1	i really like it
1	i really like this album . i would recommend this album to anyone who like this
0	this is by far the worst cd that i have ever bought . i wa so excited that i bought this cd but this just suck . this is so bad . i really hate this cd .
1	i think we can all agree that trey songz is without a doubt one of the best rapper to ever grace hip-hop . a the first guy who ha successfully blended hip-hop , r & b , and jazz , trey songz is the man . his first album , the way you move , is a masterpiece of how to blend the three part of the genre with one smooth flow . i wa extremely impressed with the album success and i wa also extremely surprised . i did not expect it to be a big a it wa . i wa hoping for more of a follow up album but he ha proven me wrong . he is a world class rapper and i can not wait for his next album .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	hall and oat . need i say more .
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd . the lesson challenge you and i know i sing better now . i recommend this for the beginner , the wannabe , and someone just wanting to sing better . maryelle b
1	wow so worth it !
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded .
1	good song . good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over .
0	meh
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !
1	shazamd this song off the good wife . it an empowering song !
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .
1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	sad time in my life but that is what being 19 yr old is all about . oh yeah , good song too .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	leave the light is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better becareful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	dudnt see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 2 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ?
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	creepy a f # lyric and danzig voice . what is not to love ?
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song also , one of my sister who also ha a woman ministry called arise she will use this song a the theme song for her next woman conference . hallelujah ! may the lord blessing and peace , wisdom and knowledge continue to be poured into and upon these awesome men of god .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	came wutg cinoyter ,
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	great band ! great song ! too bad this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	good song
