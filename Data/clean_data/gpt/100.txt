1	i am very happy with my purchase .
1	this is a great new jewel album . i love the album and i loved all of the song . i have been listening to this all day .
0	the biggest disappointment of this album is the song are not a good a the song on the two previous album . this album ha a lot of good song with good melody , but the song are not a good a the one on the previous two album .
1	so , here is the thing : i love this song and i think it is one of the best song that they have ever written . i have listened to it many time , and it ha always meant something special to me . it is one of the few song i really feel like i really got the band .
0	i like the dave clark five ! i got this album because the cover wa so beautiful . it is nice and relaxing to listen to , but i have to say i do not think it is a relaxing a some of the other cd i have .
0	this song is pretty good , but the vocal sound like somebody ha a cold and they are a little bit drunk .
1	i have listened to this song over and over for year . i have been singing along with it for several year . it is a great song to enjoy when you are on your way to or from work .
1	i have not listened to this tape since it wa originally released in 1966. it still sound great .
1	i really love the song
1	a good album . i am really a big fan of her and i am glad that she still ha a fan .
1	prince greatest hit is absolutely amazing ! it is the best prince album i have ever heard and i am pretty sure it will be the best prince album of all time .
0	when i first heard this song , i thought it wa great . it wa fast and i like fast music . just when i thought i like it , the singer went into a deep voice that reminded me of the voice of a child . then the voice changed to a deeper deeper voice and i thought the song wa over . it sounded like someone wa singing in a church . but then it got better . that second part wa the best part . the rest of the song wa good but after that , i did not like the song anymore .
0	this is a wonderful song about the power of love and the power of friendship . i like the song . i hope you will love it too .
1	this band is a good one . i like this song .
0	her voice wa okay . i like the song . i do not like all the lyric .

1	i do not think i have ever heard a tom wait song that i did not like . i heard this on the radio and thought it wa good .

0	i like this . i like the band but i do not know about the music . it is a little hard to follow . i like the song , but i think i would want to hear an album with a better band .
1	this album is better than the most perfect album , i think .
0	i think you should remove some of her song from your site . i think she is a really nice girl and a great singer but some of her song are a little too repetitive .
0	i like this record . it is great ! i like it a lot . you should try it .
0	this song is definitely the best one on this album , but i do not think it is the best album overall .
0	there is something inherently wrong when a band with a reputation like new order , who were the biggest band in the world then , and are one of the more influential band in the world today , is still selling million of cd and dvd . this band wa in the top ten of the billboard 200 chart for three week in a row . they were on the cover of the billboard 200 chart for three week in a row . they had the biggest album in the world after the beatles sgt pepper lonely heart club band . they even got to the number one spot in the uk .
1	my son gave it to me for my birthday . it say brandy with her own brandy on the front of the cd . he loved it . it is a cute song .
0	these are the type of song that make me want to make a full on metal version of this song . it is a catchy little pop song that is very easy to dance to . i like this song because it is very easy to dance to , and i like a good pop song . i do not usually download song , but i downloaded this song and it wa a good choice .
0	this is a great album . i love this band . they are a good band . this is their first album . i like the first album , but this one is better . i like the first album they released . this album will blow you away .
0	this song is terrible . the movie version is better . but the original is great .
0	i always had a problem with this song . i liked the song but there wa always a problem with the lyric . this is like the i am in love with myself problem . it is an interesting song but not everyone can relate to it . i think it is a great tune and is very enjoyable . i have a lot of respect for tom wait , but this song is a joke . i do not think it is a terrible song but it is a very weak effort that i can never get behind .
0	i like your version of this song ! it is very nice !
0	lareiner is good . it is not a very good song .
0	i have a few of these in my collection . the music is very good , but the lyric are a little confusing . i really like the video .
0	i think this is the best album ! i just love it . this is the best album !
1	i am a huge lorde fan . i just bought this cd to listen to this , but i am in love with it . i also bought a box of the other cd to listen to this cd and it is even better . it is like a perfect mix of the two . i will buy this cd in a heartbeat .
0	this is a really good version , but i have to say that this is the version i like the best . it is a very nice version . i have purchased the other version , but this is the only one that is really special to me . i have purchased some other version , but this is the only one that really stand out to me .
1	the cd is all that i expected . i really liked the song and the voice . my only wish is that the cd wa a little bigger . it is clear to me ( for the first time ) that the dave clark five is a group that is very talented and really care what they do . this is a great cd .
1	this song is really catchy .
0	i like this song alot . i liked the video and i thought the song wa very good . i did not like the song at all . i thought that the song needed more energy and a more positive feel . i thought they could have used more energy and more positive vibe in the song . i thought that it wa kind of boring . i thought the first verse wa ok and then the second verse just fell flat . i thought the third verse wa boring and then the fourth verse just fell flat . i thought the second part of the song wa very good and then after that i just thought it wa too short .
0	nice track , but i am having trouble getting to the end when i click the play button . i am not sure why , but i guess there must be a problem with the computer . i will continue my search for a solution . bob
1	this is one of my favorite prince album of all time . i wa happy to see his music pop up on the radio . i love this album .
1	this is a song i could play over . it ha a great hook and i like it .
1	i am a classical music fan . however , it is difficult to find music by the great composer that i enjoy . what is the remedy ? i am trying to find some music and i can not find what i am looking for . the internet is full of music i can not find ! i have become a music consumer and enjoy listening to all kind of music i can not get for free . so what is the remedy ? i guess that is the question . this album is not like the others i have tried . the music is of a higher quality and if you like classical music , this is a must have . it is not to be missed .
1	this is a great song . i would like to hear more song from this album .
1	i am a young woman and i can not get enough of this song . i love the melody . i love the message and i love the way it is sung . i really feel the emotion and i think it is a beautiful song .
1	this song is great . i wa in the car and the radio came on . it wa so beautiful i wa so happy . now i can find the rest of this cd !

1	this is one of my favorite christmas song .
1	i would have to say that this album is very good and ha a lot of good song . i enjoy listening to this album , but i think that everyone should listen to this after the first few .
0	i preordered this cd . i thought it wa just going to be the 1st cd in a series . i pre-ordered it . but i wa disappointed . i do not like their music anymore . i did not like this album nor the dave clark five . after i listened to it , i will probably not buy anything from them ever again . i am so happy that i got the first two cd in a box . i am not happy with this album .
0	i really love this album .
0	i have never liked this song . i have always liked the version of this song that the tv show had on the show the real adventure of jonny quest but i hate the new version because it is so fast that i do not even notice it . i have never liked this song because it wa always something that i would say i do not like this song but i do not want to listen to the other song i have to say that i have always liked letting go and love me like there is no tomorrow but this is one of those song that everyone just want to hear and i always forget . since i have so many cd , i do not really know what i am going to end up buying next . i do not know if it is a good song or not but i always like listening to it .
0	i love david lee roth and all his band member . i hope he will be able to get back to the music that he wa doing before . he is a great musician . i love the music he ha written and i enjoy the time i spend listening to his music .

1	i love this song .
0	i love this album . i love the sound of the original album . the movie version is the same though .
0	i do not like it . i do not like the band . i like their music .

1	this song is very sweet and very well sung .
0	i like the song . it is a good song . i like the harmony .
0	the theme of this song is one that is common to many christmas song , the christmas spirit and the joy of family and friend .
1	maria is back ! this is maria best release yet . i love it ! it is just beautiful .
0	barbra streisand is a great singer , but i am not a fan of her . i like the cover of this song , but the original is better .
0	the only song i like in this cd is shine . there are other song that i like , but they do not take you away from the one song that take you away from the rest . i would give it a 4 star rating . it is a shame that the people that put this cd together do not know how to put a cd together .

0	i have heard marie osmonds voice all my life . she wa one of my favorite singer of all time until i found out she wa gay and that she had been hiding it for year . i wa really disappointed in her singing voice . i wa hoping for a more mature and mature voice . i do not know her new song , but i thought they were okay .
0	i can not believe this is my first review of any cd , because if this is what i get for reviewing cd , i should not be spending my time doing this . i am not even sure why i bought this cd . i did not listen to it until it wa too late . it wa a cd that i purchased at the local library . i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa working on my computer , and i saw this cd and thought it would be a good one to listen to while i wa typing . i bought it not knowing what it wa about . i listened to it a few time , and then i decided to just throw it away . the most annoying part about the song is that it is the only one where she sings the word while doing a crazy dance .
1	i think this is his best song . from the first time i heard it i thought that wa it , but i have listened to it several time since and i definitely think it is a great song . i am glad i finally got a copy of this album , because i would have lost it before i got it . this song is a great example of a powerful theme .
0	i found this quite enjoyable . not a lot of variety but not boring either . i would give it an 8 instead of a 7 .

1	this is one of my favorite . i really like this song . i really like this song , i really like this song , i really like this song ,
1	this is a good cd , but on the other hand , i would like to buy the other song from the cd . there is a nude song which is a good song but there is also a breathless song which is a bad song . the breathless song is much better . i like both of them .

0	one of the worst song i have ever heard . i do not really care about this song . it ha a catchy hook and some good lyric but i am not sure why i even bothered rating it .
1	this band wa supposed to be the next led zeppelin , but they have been in the shadow of zeppelin for 10 year , so this is a bit of a letdown .
0	i am not a big fan of this album and i do not think it is a good one at all . it is all just one big , one-dimensional song . you can tell that the song were written by different people and not even in the same room . i will be looking for something else from bonnie soon .

0	i have listened to this cd twice and i really like it . i wish i could afford to buy it again , but it is just not worth it . i feel that it is not good enough to recommend it to the public . i have bought a cd from cdbaby that i think is better than this one . i would certainly recommend this cd to any of my friend , but i would not recommend it to anyone else . i have no idea what the quality is like , and i have not personally listened to it .
1	i guess i should have done this a long time ago , but i thought i would check out the first one on the karajan label . i usually listen to lamour et la mer when i want to get back in touch with my love for karajan , and then later i listen to lenfant when i want to get back in touch with my love for karaja . the first song i download wa lenfant , which is the original recording . ( i do not know if it is the same version that wa recorded in paris , but i know it is a different version . )

0	i do not know how to put into word how i feel about this . it is a good representation of american music at that time - the early 60 . when i first heard it , i thought that it wa a parody of duke ellington and his orchestra . for me it is the only example of ellington and company on the radio . it is actually a very good example of jazz a a whole . i feel that it is the very best recording of duke ellington orchestra . it represents the best of his work and it is a good representation of the 60 .
0	i do not listen to any other singer except tom wait . i listen to the song and listen to the lyric . i love tom wait . i listen to his song all the time . i feel like i just met tom wait . he is my favorite singer . i love him !

1	i am a huge fan of sam sparro , and i love this song . it is good , i like his voice . it reminds me of a sam sparro song .
0	this is no masterpiece , but it is a great album - just listen to the guitar solo and you will have no doubt . there is a new age feeling to this album , which is refreshing and welcome . the song have a nice swing to them and you can just imagine the guitar solo . i would recommend this to anyone who like great rock and blue and can not get enough of it . if you like acoustic album you should try this .
0	i love this album !
1	i think there are 3 type of music : those that are good , those that are great and those that are great but are good . i believe the best music is the best because it contains the best ingredient and you can find your own recipe to make it great .
0	i love r.kelly he is the hottest song writer out there !
1	i have only gotten to know mandy moore on the internet but when i found out she wa coming out with a cd i wanted one of her album that i could listen to in the car .
1	this is a very interesting cd . this is definitely the first time i have heard jewel sing live , so i wa really surprised by many of her song . i wa pleasantly surprised by the sound of music , and i wa very disappointed by the star . most of her song are very unique , but i do think she ha a lot of talent . overall , i would say she ha improved with each album she release .
0	i bought all by myself a a gift for my son . i do not know how old he is , but i hope he is old enough to get what i am saying . i think he will like it . the song are simple and sweet . the lyric are easy to understand . i think he will like it .
1	i have listened to this album twice so far , and have absolutely loved it . i have a feeling that i will be purchasing more of her album in the coming month .
0	this is a great album . i have never heard of this band but from what i understand , they are known for their synth-pop and electronica . i like the sound on this , the melody on the vocal , and the energy on the track . there is a lot of stuff going on in these song , i am just waiting for the song my soul to start .
1	this album is the best album i have ever heard in my life . i like the cd . i would of been happy to get this cd . i like the album . i like the song in it .
1	i love the song . i love the whole album . it is a song that i think is a classic . i love the song . i love the album . i love the video . i love his voice . i love that i can sing this song to my child when they are sick . it make me happy . it take me back to my childhood . it is a song that i sing to myself when i am feeling down . when i am feeling sad . this song is on my playlist . i wan na be where you are is the next song on the album . i wan na be where you are is my next song to be sung over and over . i like the sound of his voice . he ha a very beautiful voice . i like the music of this song . i like the video .
1	i like this song . i like this song and i like this song . this song is a good song .
1	i have always liked this song , but never knew the lyric . i have to admit , though , that i enjoyed the vocal arrangement and the piano on this one .
1	the opening is a perfect example of the type of song that would make a great country-pop song . the lyric are also superb . it is a shame this old man is not mentioned on the cover . the harmony are excellent .
1	i do not have that many album by barbra streisand , but this one is one of my favorite . she sings the song with her usual good voice , and it is not just a cover , but a great one .
0	i bought this for my husband to enjoy and listen to while driving . he love to listen to the radio in the car and is more into music than i am . i hope to eventually listen to this album while i am off work so that i can listen to it while i am working . i am very impressed with what i have purchased so far .
0	i really do not care for this album . i gave this a 3 because the song are decent , but the album sound so bland and generic .
1	this is the best trance ever .
0	i downloaded this cover because i love the band . i like their version of song like i want you back and take my breath away and i thought it would be cool to see what they look like in their suit . i have not heard the song yet but it sound cool to me so far .
1	i agree with the rating of this song , but i have to agree with others that think this is better than i believe . this is a very powerful song that should be listened to on a daily basis . this is a great song to use in worship .
0	this is very disappointing , if this is an april fool day joke . i guess you could say it is the story of a christmas carol . it is a very good song , but not outstanding . it is not good enough to be a christmas carol . the only redeeming quality is that the lyric are funny . the music is average . i am not sure why this is a joke . i am not sure why the song is titled the story of a christmas carol . i guess it is supposed to be a parody of the song .
1	what a beautiful album . the music is beautiful and it is the most beautiful album that i have ever heard . this album is filled with beautiful and emotional song . i would highly recommend this album .
0	i had no idea this wa even a real song until i read the lyric on amazon . i guess i am not the only one . this is a real song . david lee roth is a real singer . it is about a woman who is being raped , and the two men responsible are going to go to jail . i do not know how this is going to happen , but it is happening . david lee roth sings about being a rapist , and his victim are going to have to pay for their sin . i can not believe this is real , but it is . for all the wrong reason . it is even worse than it sound . i do not know if i am going to order this from amazon or wait for them to update it . it sound like it is going to be a good song , but i just do not believe in it realness . i am not sure why they put this on here . i guess i do not like david lee roth , but i do not like the way this is being sold online . it is a real song , and i am glad it is here .
1	this is one of the best song by r. kelly . i do not even know if i am supposed to like this , but this is one of the most powerful song of all time .
0	i am disappointed in this song . what is this ? more of the same . i think miley is singing about the world that we live in and i am just not with her on this one . i hope she start releasing more music soon . this is just a bunch of generic pop song .
1	i love the piano playing in this album .
1	i am not sure why my sister got pregnant , i think it wa a result of beautiful life cd by this artist . the music is very beautiful and her voice is perfect .
1	i like this band
0	this song is one of those that you can dance to , with no lyric . just pure body movement and joy .
1	i had an hd-ma1 system for about a month and wa impressed with the sound quality . the sound is extremely good & very clear . the surround sound presentation is also very good . i like the way the music is presented on a large screen , & the music move from one speaker to the next . i like the way the music is presented . this is a good album to listen to on the car .
0	i loved this album .
0	this is a song that i heard many year ago , i remember listening to it on the radio . when i heard it for the first time , i said to my husband this is a great song and i bet that i have heard it before . i did not really hear it in it entirety until a few week ago , but now i want to play it all the time because i love it and i can not help but think of all the time i had when i wa growing up . it seems to be about the time of year when i can not help but feel that i am in love and i want to tell everyone about it . so i play it on repeat throughout the day and when i take a shower or sleep . it make me think of the time that i can not wait to tell everyone about it . i hope that you all think so too .

0	i have always liked jazz piano , but this album is the first album that i really got into it . it is a good album .
0	this song wa cool , but it wa not the greatest song ever . this song is about the band first tour . they all started to play this song and they were all talking about how they just wanted to play it one more time and they wanted to play it with the band . then , they played it one more time and they had to play a new song . i just thought this wa a cool song and i liked the way the band played it . i would have liked to hear the band play it one more time . i do not think this wa the best song to make it on the first album . i like the recording . i like the lyric .
0	i bought the cd because i like the song , it is not the best song , but it is not bad , i think it is a good song , i just do not like the song , it is not a good song and it doe not make sense to me , the lyric are not that bad , but it is not a good song , also , i do not like the song ,

1	i have never heard this concert , but i am a huge fan of prince . i wa very excited to get this cd because i had heard about it for so long . this is not a perfect recording , and i do not think it is the best sound . what is it like to have people who are screaming and cheering in the background ? how about the crowd noise or the people in the background ? it is really hard to hear . what is it like to put this on after a concert ? i would have paid good money for this . i got it for free . i do not think it is the best version , but it is very good . i would give it a 5 star rating .

1	rnbradley is a great singer , but it is too bad he had to put out this garbage ( which i have already listened to like 20 time ) . if he could just quit , i would be fine with it . but he is still gon na put out good , though .
1	this song is so beautiful . i love the melody and i love the message . i have been watching the video , and it is so disappointing . it is very cartoony . i would like it to be more sophisticated , and le cartoony .

1	i have never heard any other symphony orchestra that could play this many individual recording to the extreme of the chicago symphony orchestra . not even the chicago symphony orchestra can do this . the chicago symphony orchestra is the only orchestra i had ever heard that could play the concerto in c major in such a way that it is almost impossible to hear any individual part of it . i have never heard a chicago symphony orchestra recording that could do this .
0	i love this cd . it is a nice collection of song . some of the song , though , are just plain stupid to listen to . i like them , though . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	one of the most enjoyable album that i have ever listened to . so good , i do not know whether to call it a masterpiece or a bomb . the beatles were amazing back then and this group definitely have their own sound and style . they are also super-fast and do not waste any time . highly recommended .
0	this good , but i like the first part . the second part is not really good .
1	this is a great collection of song for those with a wide range of musical taste . this album is definitely not for everybody . if you are a fan of the 80 music and want some good music to listen to you will love this album .
1	i love r.kelly . not only is he talented , but he is a talented singer .
1	i really like this album . i really like the vocal on this album and the song . the only problem i have with this album is the song are all short . i do not mind short song , but these are very brief . i wish they would make more album like this one . i am glad i bought this album . i would buy this album again , maybe the next time i order a cd .
0	i thought this cd would be really cool . it ha some good song . the song praise be the lord is one of my favorite . the other song are pretty good too . i am not sure how good the song are , but the lyric are nice .
0	i have had this cd for a few month and have listened to it over and over . it is the most atrocious song ever recorded , and it is a shame that people are willing to pay $ 20 for it . i am sorry , but it is the worst cd on the planet .

0	i bought this from the site and it sound amazing . can not wait to hear it a i am getting sick of the current version out of the grateful dead .
0	i think that this is one of the best song ever performed by the beatles . if you listen carefully , you will hear that the opening part of the song is rocking . and the whole song is about the same . i do not know what rocking mean , but it sound cool . i wish that they had recorded it on a cassette tape so i could have listened to it again .
0	i can not stand this album . i wanted to buy it but i do not like it .
1	i like this song a lot . it just reminds me of a cool , funky version of a tune by the rolling stone .

0	this album ha been on the radio for a long time . i like it but i do not think it is very good . some of the vocal are very un-professional . the arrangement is not very good . some of the lyric are not very good . i think that you should make a new album with song that you like .
1	i thought this album wa really good . they changed the title and put the first song on the bottom . i like this album a lot .
1	this is a great song , the lyric are great .
0	the song is a powerful song about the triumph of faith . the lyric are a little long for a 7 minute song , but it is a good song for the christian , who longs for god to be his strength and guide .
0	this song is not only a great cover but the original is not bad either . the first half of the song is pretty good , but the second half is just plain boring and just go on and on . i can not listen to the rest of it without getting annoyed by the repetition and lack of passion of the lyric .
1	i agree . this is a very good song that is perfect to sing in church .
1	i would like to say that this is a great band but that i do not know why no one ha released a new album . i do like some of the song and would like to hear more of their music . i love the sound of the band .

0	i am not a fan of this song . i have listened to this song on the radio a few time , but i could never get it to work on my radio . i thought it wa really good , but i could never get it to work . i think that it need some more of the instrumentation that the beatles had and the instrumentation used in the beatles version of this song is not there in this . this is a really good song to play on the radio , but i think that it would be better if there wa more of the instrumentation that the beatles had used in the beatles version which wa not there in this version . also , it need more guitar solo in the beatles version which wa not there in this version .

1	wow , this tape is amazing ! i have never heard a tape this big before , and most of these track are not available anywhere else . it is a tape that is extremely hard to find , and i have never seen a tape where almost half the song are from obscure band . there are no filler song at all , and you will find yourself listening to and enjoying every song on this tape . there are also so many different genre represented . this tape is not only a very special compilation , but it is a good introduction to punk rock and hardcore , a well a to other form of rock . i would urge anyone who is a fan of hardcore music to at least give it a listen . it is not only a great compilation of punk tune , but it is also a good way to get into this sub-culture ( if you are not already ) . the hardcore punk song on this tape are not only very good , but they are also very different from the majority of the band that are represented .
0	this album ha been called one of the best record of all time . it is a little bit of a stretch for me , since i have been so preoccupied with the like of nirvana , my bloody valentine , and sigur ro . but i did enjoy this one . the song on this album are all very catchy and have a great beat to them . the song have a very catchy pop-influenced beat and are great for jamming out to .

0	this is the cd everyone is talking about . dave clark is one of those rare singer who can truly sing his own song , but with the help of his band on this set , he is able to create his own sound .
0	i feel like this song is one of the best on the tape . it is a fantastic song . i like the one that got away by the dave clark five too .
0	this is just an average album and i would not recommend it .
1	i love the song and this album . i love the music . i have been listening to this album for a while and i love it . i have been listening to the older album by the backstreet boy and some of the music for a while , but this one is better .

0	this is an interesting song . i can not really say that i liked this song . i thought i did , but a you can hear i wa wrong . this song is just too fast and too jazzy for my taste . it is not like i can not stand a fast song , but i do not think this song fast . it just doe not flow for me . i am really not a fan of these song that are more of a fast jam than anything . this song is actually a pretty good song , but it is just not my kind of song .

0	i am not sure what to say . i wa impressed with his first album , but this one is terrible . it is a one-trick pony kind of album . just listen to all of it and you will see what i am talking about . you can not really take a bad album at face value . i wish i had paid more attention to the title of the album . it is called skyworld , but it is not really about that . it is about the music . i would recommend this album to those who are looking for a good album , but not willing to pay $ 15 .

0	i just listened to this cd yesterday , my first time . i wa pleasantly surprised , the band sound good and there is a lot of upbeat music . unfortunately the vocal are terrible . the song is so poorly written that the band member must have written the entire song in one sitting . i am not a huge fan of reo speedwagon , but they have a solid songwriter in john frusciante .
0	i like this song . but i do not think it is the greatest song . it is a great song , but i think the movie is even better .
0	this is a great song about standing up for your right . it is empowering for a young girl like her .

0	this is the most interesting trance album i have ever heard .
0	this is the best of all of their album . if you like the hammond style of music then this is for you . the lyric are not very interesting , but if you like hammond then you will like this . i like the song the day will come best .
1	there are some great song here , but most are from the 20 th century . a beautiful and unusual collection . each song is a gem , a treasure .
0	i think this cd is good , but i really wish this wa more rap .
0	this is off the new album , but is a live recording of the album . this is off the new album , and it is a live recording of the album . it is not the exact same recording , but wa from the same tour a the new album .
0	i like this song . the music is great and the lyric are not that long .
0	to all those out there that think this is supposed to be some kind of a tribute , i do not know why you would listen to anything this guy ha ever written . i do not even know how to respond to you . sorry if i sound like a troll .
1	barbra streisand is awesome . i have been a fan of her music since i wa a little girl growing up in the 60 . i had a crush on her . i went to her concert in 89 in detroit and i will always remember how it felt to be there . she wa great .
1	good .
1	i am a big fan of r.kellys music and have been for year . this cd ( the best of r.kelly ) is by far one of the best of his cd . there are song that i like and song that i do not like , but it is not a bad cd . i personally like the second disc . the song that i do not like are the one that are usually sung by woman . it seems that a lot of the music on his album is sung by woman , and i do not like that . i do not think that woman should sing on his album . on the second disc , he play some of his classic r & b song . some of his hit , like love mean everything to me and you wa made for me are very well done .
1	this album should be in everyones cd collection .

0	i like this song , and i think that is the reason why . it is a great song . but i do not want to listen to it .
0	i really really liked this song , but i did not like it .
0	i wish she had released an album like this in the past , before the success of her latest album . this album is very different . this is not the same song a her previous album . the song are not the same either , and she sings them differently . the vocal are not a good a on her other release . although , the song are great , and the vocal are great . i would not compare this to earlier album . i feel that this is the best album she ha ever released . i am glad she is going back to her root , and releasing a true musical masterpiece .
1	this is not a cd of instrumental music , but an album of song . the song are arranged by john williams , who won a grammy in the 70 . the recording are made on a 78 rpm record with stereo . this is one of the most popular album of williams career .
0	i am the most disappointed of all the reviewer . you all have rated this song at 5 star . please rate this song at 1 star and call the song a poor job . how could you make such a song a 5 star ? i am disappointed . you will all rate this song a lower rating than i do .

0	the first of his album on which he sings in english , with emma rydin and the orchestra . this recording is a single disc in the karajan catalog , rather than an album . the liner note are in french and german , which is not the best way to discover karajans music , but it is a good introduction .

0	this is a cd from a friend that i really like .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this , but i think this is false advertising , not only because she sings like a robot , but also because there are a lot better song on the album , and i can not think of one that ha this kind of good singing .

1	great album . very positive song .
0	i have to tell you , i am not a big fan of miley cyrus music . her album , wrecking ball , may have been awesome ( she can sing ! ) but i have never liked it . not because it is a stupid album , but because i feel it lack substance . it is not a great song on it is own , but when the chorus or the song is played , the song is better . i have to tell you i am disappointed in this album . it is only because i love miley . i still believe that she can sing , but do not know how . she is very talented and can sing . i have seen her perform at the white house and it wa awesome . she is a great artist . i love her . i just do not know .

1	this is a good song , but not a good a love and lie .
1	if you are a fan of old rock and roll , then you should definitely check out this set . it contains all ten album listed , with a total of 42 song . the song are fast and fun with memorable hook that will have you listening to this set for hour .
0	i love it , but i am not sure it is worth it . the band ha always sounded good , but this is just a little too boring . it is like they got bored and decided to just throw on some white noise , sadistic music , and then pretend it is some kind of jam .

0	the album is decent . there are a lot of good song , but i do not like the music . the music is too loud and doe not flow like most christian music . i am not sure what the problem is . i do not think that the problem is with the cd . i think that the person who is reading the book is the problem . i think what the pastor should say is christian music is god gift to u , but we all need to be very , very careful when we listen to it .

1	i discovered this band during a trip to europe and i just love the song of this band . the song are very nice .
0	the cd is a bit off-putting . it is a good cd with good music . it is a good cd , but not what most christian would enjoy . i am not sure why most christian would not enjoy this cd . i do not think it is a problem with the cd . it is the problem with the person who is reading it . i love listening to christian music , but i think it is probably better if the pastor doe not say the thing that are on the cd . i do not think that it is a problem with the pastor at all . it is probably a problem with how the person is reading the book . i think what the pastor should say is christian music is a gift of god , but it is always better if you listen to it with the right attitude . how do you think a person should listen to christian music ?

1	in a time when hip hop and r & b music ha become all the rage , it seems many producer and artist are trying to recapture the magic of the past by resurrecting popular music icon . one of the most popular and well-known is perry como . he is most famous for his hit that include you are the top and the girl is mine . he died in 1990 at the age of 78 .
0	i have to say , all alone with something to say is the best album by bonnie tyler . the other album are okay , but i have to say , this one is better .

1	i like this cd , it is a really fun cd to dance to . i like the song . there are a lot of good song in the cd .
0	sound great ! the only reason i did not give it 5 star wa because i had to turn up the volume a little . the cd player will not hold an audio file larger than 32 kbytes . so i am giving it 3 star but i will give it a try . my only comment is that the cd player doe not have a cdr/cdrw . so you are stuck with the player .

1	this app wa a great buy . i love listening to music on my phone .
0	good song . the song is fun and energetic .
1	i am impressed with the simplicity of this arrangement . this song is one that should have been recorded by the beatles , but they got it wrong - and rightly so ! the beatles have a great gift for making music that , whilst in every way simple , is also a challenge to the listener . this is one of those song that you can hear a million time and never tire of it . i am also impressed with the lyrics/melody - both of which must have been inspired by the beatles , a there is a great deal of similarity in the two . the beatles version is , however , somewhat short on the piano solo , which make it a bit of a letdown . this could have benefited from a more detailed piano solo by the author of the song , who would have found such a thing to be quite challenging . it would also have benefited from the inclusion of , say , a saxophone solo by either one of the beatles or by someone other than a piano . this would have created a more complete piece , one which is a bit more exciting and more adventurous . the lack of this mean that i can only listen to this song , for quite a long time , without ever getting bored of it . the song is a great one , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone .
0	i love this song , it is my favorite of wanya morris material . it is got a very heavy and groovy beat and a great chorus . i really dig it , and would play it on my car radio .

0	i have been listening to this song for week now , and i can not figure out why it is not the first one that is gone by . joe s
0	this song doe not deserve any negativity . the chorus is so catchy and the lyric are just a catchy . it is so good to hear a song like this that is not only very popular , but that is also so good .
1	i wish i could listen to this album again and again . the song is really good . the lyric are about loving god and being thankful for him . it wa nice to hear the song sung by barbra , instead of just spoken by her . the sound quality is really good . i think it is a very good album . it ha great music and great lyric .

0	i have tried listening to the new jvj album twice and i am still not over it . i am not sure i understand what jvj want to do with their music anymore . it is like they have lost sight of what made their first album so good . i am not sure i understand what the new album will be either . i just do not get it . it is like the singer ha lost the ability to sing , or the band ha lost the ability to play . i do not think they should be trying to be something they are not anymore . i can not get over the fact that the new album is going to be just a good a the last one . i am not sure i want to go back to the old jvj . i am not sure i want to go back to the old jvj . i guess i am just going to have to go with my gut .

0	i am not a fan of any prince . however , i am not disappointed with any album he ha released , and this is certainly one of them . the song are all good , there are many good track including song such a raspberry beret , the most beautiful girl in the world , if i wa your girlfriend , when dove cry , u got it bad , 1999 , jerk it , a little help from my friend , little red corvette , kiss of life and the most beautiful girl in the world .
0	i have to disagree with this one . i like this song , so i am going to include an interesting opinion that doe not necessarily disagree with the review , but rather think that it wa just misinformed . the only reason i can think of for why such a negative review ha been placed on this song is that it is on a soundtrack that ha an overabundance of 80 music in it . i mean , this movie wa released in 2006 , so it would have to be around that time for the song to be overplayed that much . i also believe that the reviewer doe not have the correct background on the movie , so he may be misinformed . the opening scene wa filmed a few year before the film wa released , and this song wa chosen a part of the soundtrack because it wa a pop style that wa the most popular of the 80 . a for the lyric , i believe they are a little bit old-fashioned , but i also believe they are perfectly suited for the film . i will state that i have listened to this song numerous time , and i like it . i personally think the film is better anyway , so that make me think that the reviewer is just wrong .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard in my life . i love this album so much . i bought this album on amazon and i am so happy i did .
1	i would rather listen to the original version , but it doe have a good beat , and i guess it is kind of catchy .
0	i do not think it is a bad cd , a good a it might be , it is not great . the song are good , the musicianship is not noteworthy , the arrangement are not noteworthy , the backing track are good , but the song are not noteworthy . the song are good , the backing track are good , the arrangement are not noteworthy , and the musicianship is not noteworthy .
1	i have a very favorite album by tom wait , all the album i have listen to all the time . i love his work and i have been listening to his album for many year .
1	i like it . she ha a nice voice . i like the song and it is good .
1	this album had some great song but i did not like the one that i love more than word . so i do not understand why there is not more song like this on the radio .

0	nice song with cool sound , but song are a little too fast for her singing style .
0	the sound quality is horrible . the only thing that made it good wa the fact that it sounded like it had been recorded in a basement , not in any studio , which make it much easier to review . the whole thing wa an experiment to see if you could record a band live and sound it back on tape . it worked , but the sound quality wa awful . i found that when i turned the volume up , it sounded like i wa in a basement . and there were only three or four song on the tape . but i did hear some good stuff . not worth listening to , but interesting .

0	i have always loved the beatles . even when they were a little rough , i loved the song they made . the album abbey road ha always been my favorite beatles album . i think it is one of the very few album that is actually better than the actual recording . i think they recorded it a a demo and went back and added more overdubs to the end of the song . i do not think they overdubbed much , though , except at the very end of revolution 1. i wa about 8 year old when the beatles first released it . i always had the beatles on the record player in my room , and when i wa little , i always had the beatles in the tv in my room . i listened to it often . i still have a beatles album from 1965 : yesterday and today , which is so much better than the actual album . the first time i ever heard abbey road , i wa listening to it with my sister . my sister said , it is too quiet . i said , well , that is because it is not . i do not know . i think the first time i ever heard a beatles recording , the song were still coming from the radio . i got them on cassette , and they were so much better than the recording .
1	i received one of these special 3cd package with a cd of the song on all 3 cd , and a dvd of a special performance of the song on all 3 cd . i love the song and it wa very exciting to get the package . i now have many friend in the u.k. and have bought many copy of the cd and dvd . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard a radio play this cd . so when i saw it come up on the radio earlier today i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd .
1	this cd is very well done . i can listen to it all day long . i love billy joel .
0	the song wa a bonus song on the cd and the booklet i received had the title - brandy greatest hit . very odd .
0	not only is this a great collection of song , it is great to hear them a a whole , not having to search for song to listen to .
0	a great mix of genre . i am a fan of this band . i have been listening to them since i wa a kid . they are my favorite . i think they are underrated . they are playing all over the country . they seem to be doing great . they are on good company . they have a lot of good music in their catalog . i would love to get their new album . i would love to get the video of their latest song . i think they are doing great .
1	i like the chorus very much but not the rest of the song . the last line is just a little too long and i do not know if that is just me or not . it really is beautiful but the last line is not a beautiful a the other part of the song . thank you .

0	i liked the original better than this version . it wa a very good rendition .
0	this is such a great song . the video is not great .
1	i wa excited to receive the jewel cd this year . i have been a jewel fan for many year . it wa nice to finally have her cd . it is beautiful
0	reo-speedwagon is the best . i like them , and they are my favorite .
1	i love this band . i have been a fan of the band since i heard them on the radio . i would love to hear more song from the next album .
1	i just bought this cd because i wa told that it wa a rare release by the band . i wa not aware of the band prior studio album , but i thought this cd would be a good addition to the collection of their first studio session . i wa not disappointed . i am a classic rock fan and this cd is excellent . i bought it in hope of the band releasing a new studio album in the future .
1	a very emotional and well produced recording . the music is great , and the performance by all the player are superb . this is a very good recording .
0	this is the best movie . the movie is very emotional and the song is so beautiful . my family love this movie . we watch it so often . there is nothing better than watching the notebook over and over again . it make me feel like i am in a happy mood and that make me very happy . but watching the movie is not a good a listening to the song . the song is so beautiful that it make the movie even better . if you like the song , then you will love this movie . i hope you enjoy the notebook .
1	this is a great piece of art . there is a lot of good music on here a well . i just wish it wa in a different format . the lyric and vocal are great . the music is average . i wish i could get this on a cd . i would buy it .
0	i have been listening to this song for the past few day . i wish i could sing along . it is the perfect song for any time of the day . i really like this song . i have only rated it three star because of the singing . i really enjoy the video , too . it make me smile .
0	i have listened to this album for year and have always liked it . the song title seem to be the weakest part of this album and they do not really need them . sometimes , you realize that there are more song on the album- i wa always reminded of the wailing or the lord is my shepherd . this is his best work yet . i thought he wa going to make an album a la michael w. smith that wa not repetitive and did not talk about the same thing . however , he did make an album that ha good song and is not all about him- that is not to say this is bad- it is merely different .
1	i love how well she sings , but it is not easy for me to get into her music .
1	i like this song . i like it very much . i like it .
1	i have not been able to find a good place to buy this album . the best i have been able to find is at amazon.com . i have never heard an album like this and i am very happy that i found it .

0	barbra-streisand is a great singer .
0	1 ) it is a little hard to understand what you are looking for . if you are looking for a collection of song with a good tempo , then my heart belongs to you , you do not know me and the first time are all good choice . 2 ) i would be surprised if you are looking for a collection of song that you have heard before . a lot of the song on this album are brand new , and i am sure you can find them on other song . 3 ) the album ha one song that is new , and three song that have been played on the radio , and another song that ha been used in ad . you are more likely to find a song on one of those that you like . 4 ) the song my heart belongs to you is a new song . the song you do not know me is an original song , that ha never been released on a cd before . you are more likely to find a new original song on a cd that is released in a year or so . 5 ) the song are not sequenced in a way that make sense . the song you do not know me is sung in the key of a , then the song the first time is sung in the key of c , then the song my heart belongs to you is sung in the key of b . 6 ) the album ha a lot of song that are written in the key of b , then the song that are written in the key of a , then the song that are written in the key of c. 7 ) i do not find the song to be very interesting . i think the song are average , but nothing special .
1	this is a very good cd . the song are very long and have a slow tempo which give the listener a good opportunity to listen without being bored . the lyric are very interesting and have a great message . i listen to her voice on this disc and i think she is a great singer and i think this is the best album she ha ever made . she ha been keeping her talent under wrap for quite a while now and she is getting better and better . i suggest everyone listen to this album . it is not a jazz concert . it is a very good concert . she is a good singer . i hope she keep making these cd . i also hope she will keep making movie .
0	her song are very good , but she sings too low .
1	i think i am going to buy this album . i love this song . the lyric are very clever and clever .
1	great song . i know it is a little cheesy but it reminds me of a summer night in the mountain . it is a great party song for party and wedding .
0	i bought this cd because i heard the song i am a believer on the radio . i liked it so much that i bought the cd . i listened to it on the way home and realized that i had never heard it on the radio . it sounded different from what i remembered . this cd sounded very thin , and it had a very thin sound . it wa good though . the song were good , and the instrumentation wa very good . the only problem wa the bass , which wa very low . i did not mind though . it wa great . it wa the only song on the cd that i could not listen to on the way home .
1	this is a great band . i love when they do these live show . this is a great band to see live in person . i love the sound of this band .

0	i really liked the music on this album . i love the way tom scott writes his song .
0	christmas music is like a gift from heaven for me . this is an excellent collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with a great vocal performance by marie osmond . marie is one of my favorite singer , and this is a great collection of christmas music .
0	you can not listen to this cd without thinking , what kind of music is this ? this is not an album that i want to listen to . i would give it a 3 star rating because it ha many good song , but it is more than 50 minute long . there are many other cd on the market that have longer song . this is not a good cd .
0	i love this album . it wa a great addition to my collection .
0	lyric are great , but the vocal are not . the vocal are good , but the lyric just do not stand out . they are not bad , but the lyric do not match the melody or flow of the song . also , there are too many word . there are over 100 word in the song . it is like he wrote every word on the page and then cut and pasted it into the lyric . it is not a bad song , but it could have been written better . and i do not think it wa . i think he just did not know how to write song . he is a great lyricist , but he is got to get some of those great word , and some of those great melody . it is just that he doe not have the song .
0	great piece of music and recording .
0	i have bought all of his album and this is my favorite . i have it on cd and vinyl . it is a great album .

0	this is a real disappointment . i wanted a great cover cd with my favorite song , but i do not hear at all any of it . the only thing that wa worth listening to wa the very early pill and bible . also , the liner note are very bad , and the booklet is very old and very thin . i did like the lyric , but there is no meaning behind them .

1	i have loved this band for a long time . i bought this album when the band wa on myspace . this is a great album and i am glad i listened to it .
0	an enjoyable album . but the backing track is a bit too much - the string sound too good to be from a recording , and there are no real drum , so this is a bit like listening to the band playing a tape and not a band in the band .
0	a great album , that also suffers from lack of promotion . if you are a fan of trance , then this is the album for you ! the album is a mixture of trance and a bit of techno . the album is well packaged and easy to listen to . however , it is highly recommended to those who do not wish to be overwhelmed by trance .
1	i am going to have to give this a positive rating . i love this song and the music video . the lyric are just a catchy a the song .
0	this is not a tom wait cd . it is a cd by the british band the goody . the goody were a british comedy act from the early 2000s . this is their first cd . they released a cd of their own song . this cd ha an average rating of one star on amazon . and this cd is not a tom wait cd . it is a good-looking cd of the goody song with a great jazz section . it is not a tom wait cd .
1	this is an awkward album . the song are good , but the beat are horrible . i would recommend this album to a friend but i do not think it is worth it .
0	this album had a very good quality and i think it is great . i like most of the song and i think they are great .
0	sam sparro - the guy name is sam sparro . he is the lead singer of the band , u-men . he is a nice guy who writes great song and sings very well . he is got a good voice and he is cute . he is a pretty good american boy who ha gone to japan and made a name for himself on tv . he is a nice guy , but he is not really very good .
0	i liked this song , but this is the first time i have heard it . what i did like is that it is a very powerful song , which make me wish for more daft punk type of song to come out .
0	i have had this cd for about a month now and i have yet to open it and listen to it . i do not like the fact that the song are not the same on the cd that i have a compared to the cd that i am going to listen to . i will probably have to get a cd burner to listen to the song on a real cd player . i like the fact that they are all different and unique . i love this cd and will buy it again .
1	i bought these cd to listen to while driving . they make me feel relaxed and i enjoy them .
0	this song get on my nerve .
0	the only other good song on the cd is santa baby . i like the other song , but i do not like this one .
0	i found this on the cd player of my car . it wa played a lot and i just like it a lot . i love hearing this in the car . when i first heard this i wa on acid and i could not even believe it wa by the velvet underground . i thought it wa a one time thing . it wa released on the same day a the ramones album but i did not know that at the time . i still do not know that at the time . i have a lot of song that i love to listen to in the car , this song ha been on the radio so many time it is a constant .
1	i wa really expecting to love this album , but it wa just ok .
1	i like this album , but i could not find a song on it , so i bought this cd to see if there were any song i wa missing . i could not find a song on this cd , but i did find a song on another cd i had . i am not sure what i wa thinking buying this cd , but i did . i like it , and i do not understand why not many people like this album . i would suggest all people buy this cd if they like it .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	lareines music is very popular in japan . but this music is not very good . the lyric are all the same , and the music is very boring and same old . i think this is a bad cd .

1	i am in the military , and this song always reminds me of my time in the service .
0	i have listened to this jazz album several time . i am not a big coltrane fan , but i enjoyed his music . the new coltrane is different from the old one , but i enjoy it anyway . if you like coltrane , you will like this cd .
1	this song make me cry .
0	i like it .
1	i love this album .
0	in all of his work , this is maybe the weakest . this is the first i have heard where he doe not really give it his all . the instrumentation is good but the song is too long at over six minute . the recording of this piece is top notch . i would rank it a 6/10 . it ha a good amount of variation , and there are some good solo and counter melody . there are a few nice moment , such a the one at 2:45 , but overall it not that spectacular . i would recommend this to fan of rachmaninoff and some other classical work . it is good . but not necessarily great . it is a good listen all the way through .
1	this album is quite good , i love the song i would rather be in love with you than dream about you by steve morse .
0	i love the vocal and the guitar work , but the song just seems to lack the energy and confidence . i do not like the lyric - or the song . the song is too predictable . the bass , drum , and keyboard all have a generic sound that just doe not fit the song .
0	not really a fan of this album , but i think it is good . i wish it wa more interesting . it is a nice album with a great beat and great vocal . but like the others , i do not really dig the lyric . i like the music a lot , and i hope he doe more music like this .

0	i bought this cd and i have to say that i agree with the other review . it is very average . i do not think the song are very good .
1	what is the difference between a self-titled album and a self-titled cd ?
0	i have several cd of reo speedwagon and one of the cd is i am so lonesome sung by the band . it ha very little sound , almost no bass or drum . it is a little depressing . i have another cd of the same band i will be right there that ha better sound . i like the sound better . it is a little more positive . i have heard a lot of cd and i have never heard this one before . i wish the author would write a review on his cd .
1	it is a really good album . the song are good .
1	i never listened to tom wait before but i found this album and i love it ! i have listened to this album so many time , i have found several song i do not remember the title of . i think they are all good .
1	this song is a great song , but the video is terrible .
0	this is not a good album to listen to in hard mode , but it is a great album to listen to in soft mode . i am just not that familiar with the artist of this album , but i will be looking for this album in a long time .
1	i bought this for my sister because it wa her first album . she love it .
0	i first saw this band at the o2 in 2006 when they played a show with the band . i had seen them live a few time with my friend . it wa awesome to see them live . i like the song and the video .
1	i love this album . i like how steve is able to make the music sound like he is on his own , rather than just going along with the group . i like how the song are a little more than song . this is a great album . i am a fan of this band .
1	the dave clark five have been a major influence on my life . in fact , i could just write a whole book about how much influence they have had on me . i think that their album are great and i have had great fun listening to them . i think this is their best album yet .
0	i like this song and i have recorded it myself at home . but , i do not know if i should buy it , because the quality of the recording is really bad .

1	i love this song ! it is a great song ! i like it .
0	i like this cd . i like the album .
1	this is not my favorite record by the beatles ; however , it is my favorite of the lennon/mccartney album . i find the music on this album to be more interesting than that on other beatles album . from the opening note on i feel fine , this is a record that is really more of a musical conversation than a song . the musical conversation is a bit more difficult to hear than the song themselves , but is well worth a listen .
0	i agree with the sentiment . this is not the best or most beautiful of karajan composition from this era , but it is a fine one to hear . i also found karajans use of the traditional trumpet to be excellent here . it is one of the few recording of this sort in which the trumpet is not drowned out by the other instrument . the flute and violin have a certain sense of intimacy that is part of karajans genius a a composer . when the orchestra play the piano , they seem to be playing on the same level a the violin and cello . that is karajan .
1	this song rock !
1	this is a very good live album . the cover wa a little weird , but the sound quality is great .

1	this is my favorite song on the cd . it is very relaxing . i always sleep to this song .
1	i bought this cd a a gift for my daughter . my daughter is an avid musician and love music , so i thought she would like it . i wa not disappointed . i wa really amazed at the music quality a well a the sound quality on this cd . it ha a lot of great music . i have listened to it many time in the last few week and i have learned a lot . i am a pretty big fan of music and would highly recommend this cd to anyone .
1	so sad and terrible . i have listened to this song so many time i lost count . this guy wa a hero . i used to be a nurse . i remember a lot of people dying in the hospital . i love this song . i hope they put a little more oomph in his singing .
1	i wa a huge fan of jon lord music when he wa with the band the police and i loved his album re-birth a well a the live album the tourist and live in tokyo . i have had the opportunity to see him live about 2 time , both in the u and in australia . i am happy to say that i have seen him live once in london and once in paris . his playing is top notch and he really put on an impressive show .

0	the sound quality is really good . i love this song and hope it is still around .
0	one of the worst cd i have ever listened to . i have heard them all from the radio . this is not an example of good music . this is just horrible . you can not even understand a song on this cd . i have no idea why i still have this cd in my collection . what is it with these people ?
1	i have never heard a music cd that ha such a strong and unique cover . i do not think i have ever seen one like it . but then again , my experience with this disc is limited . thanks for the cd .
1	this is a very good album . the dave clark five arrangement are great .
0	this is a great song and the album is terrible !
1	i love this cd because it is very good . it ha a great mix of worship music .
1	i like it
1	this is a great recording of the concert . i have the album for the first three song , and then i got distracted by the others . the sound quality is good , and the crowd is pretty good , but it is a little too loud and not a loud a the best recording i have heard . i think i would have preferred a better sound to this one .
1	i bought this cd and i love it . i do not think i would have found it if i had not seen it on the internet .

1	i have been listening to this album in my car for month and month on end . it ha been a favorite for so long that i have been able to sing along with it without even realizing i wa singing . great album .
1	i would highly recommend this album and even buy it for myself .
0	this cd is great , i love it a lot , but , it is a little too much like another artist . so , if you like it , do not give to much about the artist , but the music itself .
1	a collection contains the top song from the movie jurassic park by steven spielberg . all the track are great and the only one that i do not like is boned because of the loud trumpet .

1	this is an excellent and well-recorded collection containing the complete recording of the music of george gershwin . i love this collection , and would recommend it to all those who have their own music collection .
0	the end of barbras part is really irritating . it is like someone is trying to make an awful joke out of their last ever show .

1	i love to listen to this song . it help me sleep and make me feel like i am going to have a good day .
0	i listened to a couple of song , and wa pleasantly surprised . it ha a couple of good moment , but the lyric feel like they are just thrown in there and not thought out . the song get a little too repetitive , but otherwise , i like it .
0	good song , if you like this song please give it a try , it is very good
0	it is an eagle album with a pretty good track list . the song are pretty good . the only problem is that it is the same a the original album . i do not like the way this album is put together . it just doe not have anything new to offer . it is just an eagle album with the same song in the same order that they were on the original album . i will give it 4 out of 10 star .

1	an enjoyable album with a great song on it . it the album that you wanted to listen to from start to finish . i do not know if it is my personal taste , but i have tried to listen to most of the album released by this artist and this is the album i like the best . i am sure that the trance album will be better than this , because it is more of a rock album , but i really enjoyed this album .
1	i really like sam . this is the first cd sam sparro ha released that i have ever purchased . i think it is a good cd , but i think he should sing something different from this song . the song is very repetitive , and i think the repetitive lyric are off-putting .
1	this is a very positive album . if you like the byrd , the stooge , and the velvet underground , this is for you .
1	it is an album that i like a lot . r.kelly and i share a lot of the same love for the music . this album ha r.kelly singing and playing piano . it also ha a lot of instrumental piece . of course , the song you are gon na miss me is catchy . the cover is nice . the song the best is a good song . i like fool rush in a lot and it ha a nice feel to it . i also like god do not make mistake and who is gon na run this town . the other song are all good .
0	this song wa well done . i can not stand the original version though and i can not stand the original version anymore .
0	what a waste to put this on a cd , what a waste to make it a cover , what a waste to make it sound like gnr . this is nothing special . do not waste your time on it .
1	love the lyric , love the sound , love the music .
0	this cd music is good for a party , but it is too repetitious for my taste .
1	i love this cover ! it is a great way to open up a song . i would recommend a listen with the original version of the song though . i think i will get the original cd anyway just to hear the original track .
0	this is not really that good . not my favorite song . but , i like the song .
1	this song wa a lot better than i expected . i like the way the song is structured and the lyric are great . i also like the way the song end . it make me feel different than i would normally feel . i am very surprised that this song made it to the first place . it would be nice if there wa more vocal or if the song ended differently .
0	this is a really good album . this is one i would recommend . it is not an easy listen , but i like it . the first time i listened to it wa in a hospital where i wa having a procedure done on my knee . i had been waiting for hour and wa exhausted . when i got home , i listened to it . the first time i listened to it , i wa about to go to sleep . i lay in bed for several hour , and when i got up i listened to it again . when i put it on , i wa so relaxed , and i wa able to go to sleep . when i woke up the next morning , i wanted to listen to it again . the next time i listened to it , i took it off my stereo and put it in my pocket and left it there the rest of the day . i listened to it the next morning while i wa on my way to work and it wa a great escape . it made me smile . i am a very happy person and i love listening to music . i thought that this album would be just like one of my favorite album , live at the royal albert hall . i enjoyed it , but it would not be my favorite . i would highly recommend this cd . it would be my first choice if i had any problem with my knee . i would recommend this to anyone if they were in a situation like i wa in .

0	i downloaded a copy of this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i like listening to it . i am not a fan of this song . it is a repetitive song with little charm . it is just a boring piece of garbage .
0	it is not a typical pop music . it is the best album that i have listened to . i am glad that i bought it . it is a must have .
1	the cd is very good . the song are very good .
0	this song is exactly what i am talking about . i liked some of the song in the first half , but the rest of them were mediocre . the melody and harmony were boring , the lyric were poor , and the sound quality is average , too . this cd is not worth listening to . the song are the same a those on cradle . i will not re-listen to it , and i will not recommend it .
0	really cool .
1	if i had to pick one favorite song from this album , it would have to be i am a man by the steve morse band . it is a great blue song with great lyric , and it is the only song that i have ever been able to play live that i have been able to play live .
0	i really enjoy the album . i think that lareine is a very good singer . i think that lareine ha come a long way from the begining . the album is in my list of favorite .
0	she sings very well .
0	this song is just a little too sweet and innocent for me .
1	i love this song ! i love this song and i am going to buy it . this song is great .
1	i thought the album wa pretty good a always . the arrangement are pretty good , but the song are nothing special . the vocalist sound like a trained cat , so that is a good thing .
1	this is an all-time favorite of mine . i listen to this almost every day .
0	i have been a fan of prince since the early 80 . his style ha always been unique and his music ha always been great . he wa one of the first musician to explore the world of pop with his own unique style and sound . i own the cd ebony and ivory and have no intention of buying any prince collection . i have a whole lot of music in my collection from different artist that i have been collecting for year and year , but prince is one of the artist that just get better with age and i do not believe he is going anywhere anytime soon .
0	this song is awful
0	i have always loved this song , but it is not his best .

0	the only song i have heard by this group that i actually liked wa black and gold . this song is good , but the voice is really annoying and i do not like the sound .
0	this recording of the 9th is excellent .
0	this cd is not for me . the only song i could stomach wa mama , i am coming home . i am a big fan of r.kelly , but this is not his best album . it is a little rough . i do not have much of a problem with the lyric ( i think that is r.kellys issue ) . but , the music is not his best . it doe not have that piano sound . it ha a little bit of a jazzy sound to it . also , the tempo is a little fast , which i do not like . the first few song are very fast , which i found distracting . also , it is an album that is almost one-note - you can not really tell what song it is , you know . the only one that i could get into wa mama , i am coming home . it is a very good song though .
1	this cd is fun to dance to . it is a really good cd . it is a different band with a different style to me .
0	this album wa so good , i could not stop listening to it . in my opinion , they are the real deal . the only band i have ever seen them in concert that is able to keep up with them . i have a hard time believing that any other band would be able to do what they do . i have been buying them since i first heard them . i do not think they will stop recording and performing . i wish i could live in that time . this album will stay in my top 3 in term of greatest album of all time . this is the best album so far with any band . i am a huge fan and will never stop listening to them . i have seen them several time and each concert is a different experience . they are still going strong and have new music on the way .

0	i have had this cd for several month and the first time i heard it , i wa like holy shit , this is a really good song ! my mood instantly shifted from gloom and doom to euphoria . i love this song . it brought a lot of joy to my day . i have gotten to the point where i would sing this song out loud , a if i am a cheerleader . i have found that i can not help but sing it out loud when i am with my family ( especially my son ) . i have never heard a song like this before . i am going to buy more cd . i want to have a much variety a possible so i feel different . i hope this review doe not make people think of me a a horrible person . i do not know why i even posted this .

0	for me , this is the best sam sparro album of his career . the crazy love cover is more of a tribute to the song namesake and sparro , but this cover ha a lot more energy than the original , and the song melody is a lot more interesting . the lyric are just a good , but the vocal are a little rough and the arrangement are a little dated .

0	sam sparro is a nice guy , and his song , like black and gold , are very catchy . he is not a bad singer , he can sing very well , but his voice is not what i would consider to be a powerful voice . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is a great song . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is .

1	i love this one , but the song is a little overproduced .
0	this album is pretty much the same album , except for a few new song , and a couple of single , of song from the previous album , which i thought sounded a little more commercial . it is a good album , but you can not really tell if it is for a band or a solo artist , since they both sound the same . still , if you like a band you should buy this album , if you like a solo artist you should buy this album .
1	this is one of the best trance / trance-y album of the year , and it is a mix of trance and a bit of techno . the album is easy to listen to , but it doe have a repetitive feel to some of the track . the album is very well put together and ha a lot of trance track , but it doe have a repetitive feel to some of the track .

0	i have a long standing love affair with the work of john kander . one of the main reason is the versatility of his voice . on this recording , john kanders timbre is rich and warm and his range from deep bass to high treble is impressive . i wa initially drawn to his vocal prowess , but i found the arrangement to be a bit confusing . the overall sound wa good , but the music itself did not have much to offer .

1	i love this song . the song is really fun to watch . the video is very entertaining too .
0	i would have to say i have never heard a more boring , clichéd , and uninteresting album . the only thing that come to mind is the one time the beatles played at a small club in my hometown of syracuse , new york . i had seen them a few time , but i had to be there to see them because the club wa only open on monday night . when i got there , they were already at work on their second album . the place wa not nearly a crowded a it wa the night before , so there wa a feeling of being in a church . i wa in the back and did not see who wa sitting in front of me . i also did not see the band member a they arrived . i got to the front of the stage and saw them playing . there wasnt a single person in the audience . when they finished their playing , i turned around and saw a line of people waiting to get into the club . when i tried to get in , there were no vacancy . i went back to my seat and left at the end of the night . i wa just so bored and did not have anything to do . i wa just a kid at the time . i am now 40 year old and have never bought anything from this band . i have been an avid fan of music for a long a i can remember . i bought their first album at the age of 14 and have been a fan of them ever since . it is a shame that these guy are not more famous or appreciated . i have a cd that i have purchased that is by them , and i did not even know it wa from them . i just bought it because it wa on sale . i would really like to have a copy of their first album , but i have not been able to find it . i do not even know how to get that information out to a music store . i just wish they were more popular and knew that they had a big fan base . i have seen them live a few time , but i have never seen them play a record in it is entirety . i would think they would have a new cd out every year , or at least every two year .
1	this is the only song that can cheer me up . i like it .

1	i have had this cd for a while and find it quite enjoyable . it is clear , easy to listen to and easy to play .
0	i have been looking for a song with a similar message to this . so far , i have found only one which doe not have the same message . a lot of people have probably heard this song , but they have not heard this one . however , if they have , they are probably not aware that the two song are the same . it is a good looking song , but it is not a very good song . i do not believe that a song with a similar message wa ever made , but this one doe have a very good message and it is one of the few song , other than one other song , that i like . this song is another song that i like . it is very easy to read and the message is there , but it is not clear . i do not like the message this song ha and i do not think it is a good song or a good message . i like the message , but i do not like the song . it is one of the best song i have heard yet and i have heard so many song that are pretty good that this one is among the worst . i do not like this song and it is one of the worse song i have heard yet . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . i do not like this song , but it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all of this year . it is something i have to listen to , but i think i will never listen to it again . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year .
0	this is one of my all time favorite . i love this song and have played it for year and year .
0	i would have given this a 4 rather than a 3 rating , but it doe not sound like it wa meant to be a ballad . the bass in this song is terrible . the vocal is ok , but the melody is terrible . the best thing on this album is you do not know me , but then the song is about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not know what to do . the vocal are a little too high for me to enjoy it . the only bad thing about you do not know me ( and there are many bad thing about this album ) is that there is no chorus . the vocal on this song are a little too high for me to enjoy it . a new kind of love is a great song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date , and he doe not know what to expect . there are great song on this album , but the vocal are not really that high for me to enjoy them .

1	this is the first cd i have heard by the band . i am enjoying it , but am still not 100 % sold on it . the original music is a bit too rock for me , but i am not sure i understand what the original lyric mean . i am hoping for something more mature , but i do not really know what else to expect . i did enjoy some of the original song that they did in the movie , although they are not a well done a the movie version . i will try to post an update after i have listened more and more . i also like the new caught up and came to know you that ha been added to the cd . i hope this cd catch on . thank you , and i will try not to have negative review .
1	i just ordered this album . it is by far the best cd i have ever listened to . i love the dave clark five .
0	i thought mary voice wa always beautiful , but i also thought she wa a great actress . in the past , i have listened to album by several singer in her own right . this cd is so boring , it ha nothing to do with marie osmond , just a bunch of song from previous album . i do not understand how this cd sold so well . why did anyone buy it ?
1	this song is so overplayed at the gym that it is now a joke ! if this were the kind of song that you would hear in a film to create a theme or background music , i would be more understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for the opening chord ) , which get no applause ! you are lucky to get a grunt !
1	this is the best album i have listened to this year

0	i fell in love with the song and the vocalist wa very nice and i think she can sing like a angel .
0	i used to like marie osmonds song but after listening to this cd i feel like she wa just trying to live up to a very high expectation for herself . her voice is great but i can not stand how she sings . i do not mean like her voice is bad , no , i thought she wa a wonderful singer , but there is just something about her voice that make me want to turn my back on her .
1	this is my all time favorite song .
0	the theme song for the show wa wonderful , but it did not fit in with the rest of the show . it took away from the feel of the show , and it wa an odd choice for a theme song .
0	i don t like the music video . the song is not very attractive .
1	this album is great to listen to a long a you have good ear to listen to it a all of the track are good .
0	i have only one complaint about this collection- there are no bonus track . the only other negative is that there is no information given on the back cover and i had to look it up on amazon to find out information on who performed what . the review that i have read on each show are all good and i have also listened to the review . i think the collection is very good and i wa very excited about it when i first heard it . i have some negative feeling about it now , but i am not going to purchase it . i have given it 5 star , but i can not change my mind . i really liked some of the song , but the overall impression left is that i will not buy this collection . i will continue to listen to the collection on itunes though . i wa hoping for some bonus track , but i guess not . i do not know what the deal is . i will say that i am always very pleased with the performance in this collection .

0	there were a couple of good song , but there were also a few bad one . i would have given 5 star if only one song wasnt so terrible . i would suggest that the cd is a great introduction to learning to sing , since it is short . there are only three song on the cd , but they are all on the theme of the four season . the song of the four season is a good song , but the song of the four season are awful . they sound like commercial music put to bad use . sunshine is a nice song , but there are a couple of other song that are just awful . i am the walnut tree is a good song , but it is a bit too short and could have been expanded on . i would suggest that the cd is a great introduction to learning how to sing , since it is short . there are only three song , but they are all on the theme of the four season . sunshine is a nice song , but there are other song that are just awful . i am the walnut is a good song , but it is a bit too short and not a good song . the christmas song is a good song , but again , not a great one . silent night is a good song , but it is a bit too short and doe not go along with the theme of the cd . the star spangled banner is a good song , but it is a bit too short and is not a good song . o come all ye faithful is a good song , but it is a bit too short and doe not go with the theme of the cd .

0	this is a good song , but not a great song . i can not believe that the singer can sing the song . i have heard him sing it twice , and i can not believe he can sing it . it is just one of those song that you sing and people think you are a good singer . but you can not sing it . and you can not even sing it well . the only thing you can do with it is that you can sing it to yourself or sing it to your friend . the only good thing about this song is that the guitar sound good .
0	i have seen the cd a few time now , and i can not understand why anyone would want to listen to it . the worst recording that i have ever heard . if you have child or elderly parent , do not buy it . i am not even sure if there is a cd that sound worse .

1	good album , with a few dud , but the song are enjoyable .
1	this is a great collection of song . most of the selection are very beautiful and have a unique quality about them . the exception is i have got a brand new heart , and that is a shame . but you can hear the beauty in the rest of the performance which is why it is a very good album
0	i would have given this album a 5 star rating , but it is just another eagle album . i do not think it is a bad album , but i do not think it is great either . and if you are going to listen to an eagle album , listen to the original first . the original have no filler , and they are all pretty good . the only thing on this album that is not on the original is new day . and the only bad song on this album is new day .
1	i have listened to this song since i wa a little boy . it ha the same effect on me that a good cry doe .
0	there are a few song that i like and a few song that i do not like . i know this album is better because i got the first cd when it came out . i do not like the song praise god . i also do not like the song beautiful and amazing . it is weird that they did not want me to have the first cd when i got the first cd .

1	this song wa a very popular song for a very long time . it wa a favorite of elvis daughter , who recorded it for the soundtrack of the movie blue hawaii . it wa a hit for johnny mathis . it wa a major hit for billy joel , and for the beatles . this is a very popular song .
0	this is great . i love the band and i love this album . it is a great live album . the band is great and the album is great . the best song from the first two or three are the one that were from the first two or three . the rest of the album is stupid and boring .

1	this is a great album . if you like listening to song by song , this is a good album . if you like listening to song or listening to a whole album , this is a great album .
1	i love love this album ! i love the song of bonnie and i like the way she sings . i like that she put a lot of herself into the song and i like the variety of the song on the album .
1	this is for the people who tell me i can not do anything and that i will never be successful . i am a failure because i believe in myself and i am a woman of color . i am a failure because i am a woman and i have a voice . i am a failure because i am a black woman . but if i am not a black woman then i will be a failure . this song is a perfect encapsulation of the struggle we all go through in trying to find ourselves and our true voice .

1	i am a big fan of the dead and have been a deadhead for many year . i just want to say that this is a great cd , even though i do not own all the song . it is been a long time since i have listened to any dead music , and i am so glad that i have this cd . this is a great collection of my favorite song .

0	not a fan of bruno , but a fan of this album .
1	great sound . the whole time i wa thinking about this being a gnr cover , but it is not . this is a joke .
1	this is definitely not a bad album at all . i have listened to most of his album and this is the only one that i had never heard before . i wa very impressed . i did not like the fact that the song were not very well put together , but that wa not the reason i did not like the album . i did not enjoy the vocal . if you are not used to the old music and the vocal are not that high , you may find this album a little boring . that is not to say i did not like the album . i actually really liked it . i think the only reason i did not like it wa that i did not like the vocal . i thought they were too high in some of the song . the rest wa good . i would like to give this album one star because i would like to listen to it again and i would like to see if i will like it or not .

1	really nice tune , with a cool bass line and a good melody . i would love to see a remix of this song .
1	i bought this album because i am a fan of the clash and i wa disappointed to see it wa a cover album . the album cover doe not sell it and the music doe not sell it either , but i bought it anyway . i have enjoyed listening to this album . it is a good mix of rock , and blue with some reggae and punk thrown in for good measure . the sound is great with very good production . it ha a good message . i have always thought that the band were one of the best in the industry and i am glad that i finally listened to their music . i am very excited to listen to their new album . i can not wait to buy it .

0	i have been a fan of the beatles since i wa a little kid-but not this one . it ha always annoyed me that they went through all the trouble ( including recording in a studio ) just to release a really bad album . i mean really , this one is good , but not great .
0	this wa one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	i got this album for free on the first day of the cd release . i have been a fan of the clash ever since i wa nine year old . i wa very surprised when i found out this album wa a re-release of the original album . i wa blown away ! the album cover is pretty but i think the cover art for the re-release is better . i have been listening to this album for hour . it is a good mix of punk , reggae , heavy metal and a touch of funk . the singing is incredible . it is very good quality but i do not think they should have released this a a re-release . the original album wa pretty good but i think it lack in the production .

0	really love this album .
0	i have been a fan of this song since i first heard it on the radio back in the early 2000s . i believe i first heard it on one of those old nickelodeon program . that is the only version i have been able to find at the end of the song . i love the song . i love the lyric too . i love the video too . i love the whole album too . i can not help but think that the candy coated love in the song is the main reason i like this song .
0	this album just doe not work for me . i do not understand why people would buy this album .
0	i bought this cd because i had seen the song you had on your site and i thought it wa really good . i have been a fan for a few year now , and i really enjoyed listening to it and i thought you guy would enjoy it a well . i am glad i bought it , and i will purchase the other song you have on your site .
0	this song is the best song i have ever heard . i love that it is an old classic . i really like that it is got a good beat , but the ending is annoying .
1	this is an awesome christmas song ! very catchy , and the first thing that i sing to my son a we walk down the hallway .
0	i love my wife and she ha a love for this song . it is always on in the house even when she is not singing it . it is just something that she will sing along with for day . i do not know if i would have ever heard this song in a commercial that i thought wa catchy . it is just a wonderful song and i feel like it missing from the radio at the moment .
0	this is by far , the most annoying album i have ever purchased .
1	this is by far the greatest tape i have ever heard ! i would recommend this to anyone who like old school rock music .
0	this is the second song on the album that i have purchased . i am very happy i did . the song is not very good but the album is . i am hoping that the third installment of the album will be even better .
0	i am hoping to get another copy of this cd . it is a waste of my time .
0	this is a real treat for the discerning music lover , who is looking for genuine talent with the gift of music . i have often said that if you really want to know what you are listening to , then have a good look at the artist name a a clue to what to expect .
0	awol nation is a really fun song with a lot going . it is super short . the chorus is kind of annoying .
1	music help me get through my day .
1	i like this cd but i wish sam sparro would sing something that wasnt so annoying . i like the song , and the song content , but i just do not like sam voice . it sound too high , too nasal , and too repetitive . i feel like the song is missing something . it is not bad , but it is not what i would call a good example of rocker song .
0	i have only seen the fall from grace video on youtube . i can not believe a 5 year old girl would sing a song like that . i think she is so sweet and lovable , she doe not deserve to be singing about her ex-husband . i really hope she doe not sing that song in the future .
1	this is the first album i have ever been able to find of this band . they are excellent live and have an amazing sound .

0	the dave clark five are an interesting group , but their music is more like a movie soundtrack than actual music . this is a fantastic version of this song .
0	not really a review , but an open letter to a friend who ha just started listening to this album . i do think it is a fantastic album . i think it is hard to find the right balance between hard rock and soft rock . and i think stairway to heaven is one of the great rock song of all time . even though it doe not fit into the standard classic rock category , i still think it is a great rock song and i think if you want to find the great hard rock of the 90 , this is the album . i do not know about you , but i am a sucker for a good rock song .
0	i like this album , but it is a little disappointing . it is not bad , but it is not that good either . the main problem is that i do not like the vocal .
1	the first song is a re-recording of hey jude with a completely different arrangement . the second song is the beatles version of the song sylvia . sylvia is the only track on the album that wa recorded with harmony vocal accompaniment . the track is a lovely ballad with a lovely piano melody . it ha a very beatles-y feel to it . it is a very pleasant experience listening to this cd on my computer .
0	lareine is a really annoying song . it just never stop annoying me .
1	this album ha a great variety of song . i like the song on this album . i am not a fan of the song on the second album but the first album is worth listening to because it ha a great variety of song .
1	i am a big fan of the beatles , so i can understand why this album is so good : i mean , i am not sure i would have ever heard anything like this before . this album reminds me of some of the best beatles i have heard . i also like the song the beatles because it is very catchy .
0	this wa bad . it wa like a cover song .
0	i did not know a lot of the song on this album , so i wa a little disappointed when i had to listen to it for the first time . i wa expecting a lot more from this album , but i think this album is also great .
0	this is my second cd of the day . it is an album of the original tom wait album downtown train . he recorded this album with a great band and this is the best recording of the album . i think it is the best recording of the whole album . in fact , this wa the only tom wait album i ever bought . i just do not understand why they put that stupid label on it . it is not a tom wait album . it is a recording of the original music . tom wait is still there but the name is not on the cover . it is a tom wait record . the album is called downtown train and i would recommend it to anyone who love the music .
1	i have seen this album for over 30 year and it is still getting better and better . not only do i love this album , but i also love the guy who made it . the song are catchy and the lyric are great . if you like the ramones , the stooge , the ramones , the stooge , if you like hard music , you will like this album . the only negative thing i can say about this album is the lyric are a little repetitive , and it is a little longer than it should be . if you like music that is a little different , this is for you .

1	this album is absolutely wonderful . i can not listen to it for a long time without getting goose bump . the song were very well crafted , the vocal were clear and well-spoken , and the production wa top-notch , but it just did not quite do it for me . the album ha a great balance of song that are both upbeat and very relaxing at the same time , with the occasional down-tempo song thrown in . the only song i did not care for wa doubt , but i did not listen to it long enough to hate it . overall , this is a very highly recommended album .
1	this is probably one of the best beatles song . it is got a great melody and great , solid lyric .
1	i wa about 12 or 13 year old when i first saw this song . my mother had just returned from a long trip and i wa in the kitchen doing my homework when the song came on the radio . it wa playing in a jukebox in the cafe and the lyric were about the bus ride she had taken . i never knew that the song wa about a woman , but i do now . her name wa mary and she wa the love of my life . i loved her and she loved me and i will always love her . to this day i can never find a word she did not say when she wa around me . i think she wa born on the 29th of october . i have always loved music and would like to thank whoever put this song on the internet . i think it is one of the best song ever . please someone put it on the internet !

0	i can not remember what album this is from , but i think it is from the 70 . i think the song is great : it is sort of a dance number .
0	i have not heard this one yet . it look like it is about being in love and a guy who is in love is too afraid to tell his lady that he love her . so he wait until they are apart to tell her and then he run in her house and try to kill himself . so the lady in the song is like , oh my god , you did not tell me that you loved me .

1	this is my first ever review . i am new to the site and have not yet discovered the power of the internet . this is a good album . the only problem is that many of the song are repetitive . i would recommend this album to anyone who like classical music .
0	i do not know what to make of this collection of recording . i am impressed by the number of record i can get from it , but i am not overly impressed with the quality of the recording . the cd ha been recorded on the same date a a live performance at a venue called the bistro , in a city called bristow . i am almost positive that this wa done by the same group , and i am even more sure that the recording quality is very good , but i am not sure what to make of the set .
1	i love this album . i love the music and i love the picture . i love the band and everything about them . i love reo speedwagon .

0	overall , i think this album sound pretty good . i would recommend it to anyone who like rock music .
0	this is the best of the best of album . it doe not include any of the best of album . it is the best in the studio version of the album . the problem with the album is the song are too similar . i liked the band , but it doe not have a good enough song structure to be a contender for best of . i also found a few annoying melody in the song .

1	this is my second favorite song in the whole album . i like the song , but this is by far the best version of it .
0	brandy voice sound a lot different than she did when she wa on the stage and singing with the grateful dead . she sound too smooth and sound like she is singing at a club with a band . this is a great song , but i do not like the way it is sung - i do not like the way she sings - i do not like the music she play . if she would sing the same way in a live concert with the grateful dead - i would be thrilled . i am not thrilled with the way the music play on my computer . i do not like the way it play on my portable hard drive - i do not like the way it play on my external hard drive - i do not like the way it play on my usb flash drive - i do not like the way it play on my internal hard drive - i do not like the way it play on an external hard drive i have not heard the song on a different computer - i have not heard it on a computer that ha win xp - i have not heard it on a computer that ha window vista . i do not like the way it play on a different computer with win xp - i do not like the way it play on a different computer with window vista . i do not like the way it play on my portable hard

1	this is the best of the three album i have ever purchased . i have been a long time fan of the band . i saw them 10 year ago , and i have listened to them since then . i saw them in concert at the beginning of this year . their sound is so fresh and modern . the sound on this album is really amazing , and i will be buying the other two album a well .

0	i have not listened yet to the cd , i would not recommend this .
0	i bought the album and it is awesome ! i love the song i am listening to it right now . it is a great album !
0	i wish i could say this wa some sort of a love letter from a great artist but it wa not . it is an interesting listen , a compilation of song and some of them are quite interesting . but the problem is the song are in 3 part and there are only 2 track for each of the part . they are all very easy to hum along with , but if you really look at the lyric you will see that most of the song have a very strong religious message in them . i am not sure i would want to listen to them all on a single cd ! but it is a good cd .
0	this song is nice . i like it a lot . i can not get enough of it .
1	i think the piano version is better than the original .

0	this is the fifth cd released by state of trance . i have listened to this cd several time , and i still can not understand why i had to buy it . the music on this cd is not that good . the one good track is the music on the first disc . all the other track are just the same stuff over and over . i do not understand why i had to buy this cd . this is the fifth cd by state of trance , and i do not understand why i had to buy it .

1	i just finished listening to this , and i think it is a keeper . i do not know why i had not given this album a more listen yet . if you are a fan of this style of music , you will not be disappointed . i am not a fan of pop/rock , so i enjoyed this album quite a bit more than i should have .

1	i love uptown funk and i have had this album for a long time , never had a song on it that i did not like until this song . i also like how bruno mar sings in the middle of the song , it ha a nice beat and is very upbeat .
0	this is a good album . many of the song are well written , and some of them can make you swoon . i wa a big fan of this band when i wa young , and this album ha brought back a lot of memory . i really did not like the song that were country and bluesy . for me , this album is great .
0	this is a rip off of the same kind of music that we have all heard all night in the club . there is no variety or creativity here . it is just a lot of music and very repetitive . i would recommend that if you do not like this type of music that you keep your money . this cd is not worth the price of the $ 14.95 . it is not even worth the price of the cd .

0	i wa a little bit disappointed to find out that this album ha been released with the same track a the album r & b music , vol . 1 ( aka r & b music , vol . 1 ) . i know the cover is different but i just do not think it is worth the cd to have the same cd a the previous one when the music is so different . i also do not agree with the r & b music , vol . 1 album being included with this cd . but if you enjoy the r & b a much a i , then you will probably love this cd and will probably buy it .

1	this song wa the first time i ever heard mr. varney sing live , and the way he sang on this song made me happy to be alive . it also made me realize how much i missed him a a singer . i have been listening to his album for the last two year , and i still have the cd from those record . the lyric are just a much an expression of his voice , and his passion for the music a they are of his love for his wife , who he say is the best thing he ha ever done in his life .
1	it is an oldie but goodie - a real old-school blues-rocker ! mike varneys blues-rock is back with a vengeance , and so is his blues-rock guitar playing .
1	this song is a little disappointing . i expected more from her . i think the song is well-written ( for a girl singer ) , but the lyric are a bit cliche .

0	i like song with a good beat . i like all of their song . it is okay , but not the best .
1	i bought it from amazon a a christmas gift for my wife . i really like the cd .
1	i think this is an okay song . the song is pretty good , and the singer is good . it is well written , and the drumming and the harmonica work well . it is not really a bad song , but it is not my favorite .
0	i bought this song from amazon . i have listened to it on and off for the past 3 1/2 year . it is a great song . i have purchased the other version of this song from the site , but this is the only one that i really liked .
1	i listened to this album with my daughter and i loved it .
0	it is a really silly song , but it is catchy at the same time . it is not bad at all , but i do not think i will listen to it again .
0	this is a very bad song . it is extremely irritating . i can not believe the negative review .
1	i love this band , the harmony are amazing , the song are great , and the band is great , i love them .
0	this is not a great song , but it is a nice cover of a beatles song . i do not think it is a great song . it is just a nice cover of a beatles song , but it is not great . it is not even good .
0	not a good album . the production is good and the song are good . the song are good but not outstanding .
0	it is not an album . the music is very good . i love the tune in this cd . the song are very nice . i like this cd . it is not the best cd i have purchased though . i do not know if it is because i have a weak memory or what . it is the cd that i used to buy every other year . these are my personal thought .
1	this album is amazing . the music is very good , and the vocal are very good . i will buy this album .
1	i am sorry is a very sad song . it is about a man who is unable to love his woman . he spends his life trying to show her he love her . he miss the time they spent together and he try to make it up to her by giving her gift . he also try to make her feel good by singing to her . he doe not succeed , because she is a liar . she doe not know how to love him back . she doe not know how to love him back . she just want to be loved . she just want to be loved . she feel she should be loved , and she can not .
0	i am very disappointed with this album . i really loved the title of the album , but the album is just so bland . i have the album on vinyl and i am hoping one day to get it on cd .
1	thanks for all the information . i had no idea who they were .
0	all good song here . some good punk rock , some great . overall , the only thing that bug me about this is the fact that i bought the whole collection and wasnt able to listen to the song in any order i wanted . i guess the problem wa that i only had a couple of hour to listen to it . i would still say that this is a good compilation , but not one that will be very popular with anyone except my music collection . i will stick with the other album . i liked the first one better . i think that this is an extremely good compilation , and i do hope that some one else will like it a well . i also hope that some one else will be a disappointed a i wa .
0	the song on this album are great ! all of them are great ! however , the album ha a few flaw that i wanted to address . first , the album start out with blackbird and the next song is noel . how can you play blackbird when you already played noel a couple of song ago ? secondly , when is the last time you heard sister christian played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since i have heard it , which make me think it is not the band style anymore . finally , i do not like the fact that every song begin with a song called fade away . i know that is not a coincidence , but i like the fact that the first song is titled fade away and not fade away , or fade away . when is the last time you heard garden of earthly delight played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since garden wa released , which make me wonder if it is their style anymore .
1	this is a great album , with a new sound and a great variety of song .
0	this is the worst album cover i have ever seen . the original song had a lot of meaning , but this cover doe not do it justice . there are two song on here , one called the end and the other which doe not really matter , st. louis blue . the first song really is the best , but the latter is not to my taste . it sound like a 12 year old girl who can not be more than 23. and the song st. louis blue sound like a country song . and i do not like country song .
1	if you are looking for a music app that will allow you to listen to music while you are driving , this is the app for you .
0	this song wa the first song i heard on the radio .
0	i love this song , but it is one of those song where i wish it wa sung by a different voice .
1	i really like this cd . i have listened to it many time . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	the first single from the album , the boy is mine is a ballad , with a great beat , but the lyric are what really make this song . the lyric are very clear , and one thing he doe very well is to make his point in the lyric . i like kelly point of view on life .
0	this album feature a variety of track from the beatles early year . this song is a remake of do you want to know a secret ? it is a pretty nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a hit . it is a nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a very good song . it is not very good . it is not a very good song . it is not a very good song . it is not that good . it is not that good . it is not that good , but it is not a hit . it is not that good . it is not that good but it is not a hit . it is not that good .

1	this is a collection of recording of the music and the brain , which wa made by the musicologist alan lomax in the 1920s . it is important to note that lomax wa a very successful musician who composed a lot of piece and that he wa highly regarded a a composer . i am not sure that lomax wa the best recorder for doing his recording , but he wa a very good musician . when he did his recording he used a primitive record and player called a cylinder . he used very little reverb and very little dynamic range , which resulted in a good sound . he used a very primitive audio amplifier to amplify the record and he used a very primitive tape recorder , which recorded to a very small capacity tape . lomax had a very poor grasp of sound engineering . he did not have a sound engineer , but he did have a sound engineer for his music . for the recording of the music and the brain he used the best recording technology available at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder . he used a very primitive tape recorder , which wa very primitive and very primitive recording technology . he did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the best recording technology at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder , but he did use these technology to make his recording . the recording are not very good because he used the best recording technology available at the time . the recording are very interesting because they are not very good because of the poor recording technology used by lomax . lomax had great respect for his work and he used to say that he wished that he had a recorder that recorded to the best tape technology at the time . lomax wa very much a man of his time , and he used the best technology available during the time that he recorded his work . he did not have the best technology available at the time , but he did have the best technology available at the time .
0	this song had a strong beat to it , and i thought it wa a good song , but the vocal were weak .

0	i am not a fan of r.kelly .
0	i bought this one and then found out that the karajan version released on cd ha been replaced by a different version , which i thought wa pretty disappointing . karajan wa a huge star in his day and the mansmusic continues to be played on the radio today , but i have to saythat this cd is not karajans best . the music is finebut the production is a bit low in themix and the vocal are often a bitmuddled . perhaps if the musicwas better recorded , the singing would be good .
1	this is a really cool song . i like the way it start , and when it get to the chorus , it is almost like you can feel the rain starting to come down . a really nice song .
1	this a great song .
0	i really like this guy , and i can not wait to hear him live . i think he ha a great voice , and i am sure he ha some great material that he can write . i want to hear more of his music , i think his voice is great , but i am not sure why he is signed to a major label . i think he wa signed to a small label because his first album went platinum , his second album went gold , and his third album did not go to the top 20 on the chart . i think he should be signed to a big label and have his music on major radio station , a they do with all of u .
1	a great album . the beatles are one of the best band ever .
0	this is one of those album that i am always going to listen to when i am feeling gloomy , bored or depressed . it is a really great record , and one of the best of the 90 , and it is really worth the price of admission . a lot of people like the album . i would say it is one of the best album of the 90 .
0	i have no idea what to say about this one . i do not know if i am going to like it or not . i like this genre of music , but i do not like the lyric . i do not really have any real negative thought about it . i hope i like it !

1	i love this album . tom scott is the best jazz musician alive .
1	i am not sure how this wa on the album , but i love it .
0	this song suck .
0	this is an okay recording . there are some pretty decent guitar solo and the bassist is well-known on the southern california scene . there is not enough vocal to make it great .
1	this is by far one of the best on the radio .
0	this song wa originally released on the album carry on in 1971. the band rerecorded the song for the 1994 album the best of the best . the band had reworked the song with the addition of a third verse and a chorus . although i am not a fan of the song , i have to give credit to the band for the great song they recorded . not only do i agree with the band on most of their other song , this one is my favorite .

1	i love my composer ( see review comment in the product page . ) it is a wonderful player . i have two different version , and i own several . it is a great value . i am very happy with the sound of the box . the only flaw is that the speaker are not very good . i tried using headphone , but the sound wa too low . i think they still have a lot of problem . i have had to fix them myself . i could really use a good cd player in the future , and this seems to be the best one i have found .
1	i love this video , it is really funny !
1	i love this cd . it help me to relax .
0	the recording quality is quite good with full orchestra and full choir . the performance is well done with a good amount of color added . the opening of the piece is a bit fast and jittery , but it settle down and the rest of the piece is in good tempo .

0	this is an album i wa looking foward to buying . i have always loved r.kellys music and i wa anxious to hear what he could do with this album . however , this is not his best album . it is not what i expected . i do not know if it is his best album or not . i do know that this album is a little rough . it is not a smooth a his other album . i do not like it , but if i could be happy with just one album , i would choose this one . i also like the cover . it is unique and different .

0	i love the beatles , this is a fun album .
1	the album is all over the place . it take you on a journey through time with jp singing some very heavy blue song . from the first song you are enthralled by his talent . it seems like he is always singing to you . it is almost like he is singing to you during your sleep if you were a kid and he wa your father . his music is so powerful and compelling . this album is worth every penny , and will have you singing along for hour .
1	i bought this cd thinking i wa getting a great deal on it . not only did i get a great deal , i got a great cd . it is a collection of the song of the grateful dead , from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s . i am a huge grateful dead fan , but this cd is a good selection of great tune . the sound quality is good , and the song are all great . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who love the grateful dead .

1	this cd is a must-have . these guy are good ! i have listened to them a number of time . they are a great live band and their music is excellent . they are real big band style . this cd will have you jumping for joy .
0	i wa a huge fan of the band the clash when i wa young , and while i am not a huge fan of any of the other punk band like the sex pistol , i really enjoyed this album . i saw them live at the roxy in new york city where they played a lot of this album a well a many other punk anthem , and it wa a very good concert .
0	the band first album , and one of the few that i have owned . i find the band growing up , though , that i am not impressed at all . it is not a bad album , but it is not good either . it is got a few song that will make your ear perk up , but other song are not good at all . there are a few song that i really like , but i do not think they are great song . i wa more into the band before , but now i do not really care for these song . they just seem to be filler , and i think that people who like the band could have done with a few better song . it is not a bad album , but i think that if it wa released in the eighty , it would have been much better .

1	i like this album a lot ! i found myself dancing and humming along to it . it is got a good groove to it . the song are good . the only one that i have a problem with is the best is yet to come , but that is pretty much my only complaint . i really like the song on this album , but they are not my favorite song . i could still listen to them all day . like i said earlier , this is definitely an album worth getting .
0	i love this album , but i do have to say that i have found a lot of song to be too slow . it is definately some of the slowest i have ever heard . it is not a problem , but i will have to listen to alot of it . this is an old album , and i am hoping that i can find someone new on youtube to do a better job with this album . i have been very suprised at the quality of the song . but it still is a good album .

1	i do not know what this song is about , but it is a good one . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true lover of music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always looking for a song that brings him closer to god . i think this is one of his favorite .

1	i am a huge fan of this song . i am a proud owner of a copy . i have listened to it every day . i have never experienced a song that is this well made and well sung , but i have listened to a few other song on your site which are good , so i am going to write a review of these song .
1	this is my favorite album of john . i had seen him in concert and wa able to talk to him for a year before he died and i met him . i had heard his music for year . i wa a huge fan of tom scott and would love to learn more of his music . i hope to buy more cd by him in the future .
0	it is a prince album , but it is not a prince album by prince . prince had a great voice , and he ha a good ear for music . this album is not good , but it is good . i like this album . it is a good album .
1	i love this song because it is such a great song , a soon a i heard it i thought it wa going to be my favorite miley cyrus song ever .
1	this is my second time listening to this cd . the first time i purchased the cd wa for a friend . i had already put the cd in my truck and wa on my way to work . i pulled up to my work and decided to take a quick jog to the store to get gas . a i wa driving i looked in the cd player and noticed a cd that i had purchased earlier . i decided to play it and it turned out to be a compilation cd of song and vocal by the beatles . i played it , hoping that i could hear some of the song that i had heard before . i wa very disappointed to find out that these were just the same song that i had already heard . i wa about to return the cd to my friend when i realized that i might have been able to enjoy the cd much more if i had listened to it a second time . after thinking about it i decided to listen to it for about a week and then i would return it . the second time i listened to it i bought it . i wa amazed at the number of outstanding song . i had already heard a lot of these song and did not like any of them . but , after listening to this cd for a few time i can tell that i am going to like it . i will most likely buy it for my own personal collection .
0	first of all , it is by david lee roth . that is why it is so bad . second , it is about a guy being a rapist . it is not very funny . it is an extremely bad song . the only reason i even listen to this is because of david lee roth .
0	a very great trance album . i think this album is great . it is a good album , but not great .
0	i am going to tell you a little something about my life . i do not think anyone else can , though . i am a very shy person . i like quiet . i like listening to music . i do not like talking to people . i like writing for people . i like writing about people . this album is about my life . it is my life . i hope you like it . i hope you listen to it . i hope you put it in your cd collection . i hope you put it on your mp3 player . i hope you put it on your hard drive . i hope you listen to it often . i hope you enjoy it .
0	well , i had to give this a try to see what it is all about . i think it is all very well done and the piano and string part ( and the vocal ) sound fantastic . but when i thought about it for a while , i realized that even the song itself is kind of boring . i mean , it is fun , and a little bit different from previous version , but i would have rather listened to the original version by leonard bernstein , which wa much more impressive .
1	i love this song . the lyric are so catchy and the music is so good .
0	it is one of the best album of the 60 . it is one of my favorite . i like all the song . they are all good . it is one of my favorite . i do not think i will listen to it any other way .
0	i have purchased a few cd of the old 1960s rock band , but this wa by far the worst purchase yet . i wanted to like it , but i am not interested in the music . if i had not made this purchase , i would have turned off this computer and gone back to watching television .
1	i just saw a tom wait concert about a year ago and it wa an awesome show . it wa great to see someone my age sing his song ! i wa hooked on his music for about 5 day after that . i will never forget that concert . thank you for introducing me to tom wait !
1	this song is great worshiping and praising .
1	if you are looking for a great artist to listen to , i would recommend bonnie raitt . she is one of my favorite singer and she is very good at what she doe . this album is great , and it got me back into her music .
1	i have yet to hear this song , but it is very catchy .
1	got ta love some good year . i am just a sucker for anything that is a little country-ish . the song wa written in the early 70 and recorded in the late 70 . it is a timeless classic and will remain a such for a long time .
1	i love this tape ! it ha all the best part of classic rock , and even includes a beatles song . the story is also very good .
1	this is a very good album . the music is great . i love the song it is gon na be alright and the song i wan na be her is a masterpiece .
1	the performance on this collection are all superb , but the overall recording quality is not up to par . this is not a fault of the performer , though . it is not even a fault of the studio . it is just a fact that this collection contains all of the performance on a single disc and that the music is mixed too well ( especially in the bass , where some instrument are inaudible ) . the sound is very bright , though , and i think it is preferable to what you could hear on a single compact disc .
1	i bought this album because i liked the review . i bought it because it wa recommended on amazon . i wa very happy with my purchase .
1	i bought this cd because i am a huge fan of her . i have her book , and now i have the cd . i like the music , but not the book . it is a shame because i would have preferred the book . the lyric are not bad , and the music is top notch . i like her music , but not her book .
1	i like this song . i think it is about a guy who is lazy . he doe not want to do anything . he is a real downer . he make it more challenging for everyone around him . it is a great song to listen to when you want to get out of your way .
1	it is a very good album . the song are really good . i do wish there wa some more variety in the song , but the song are good , and i like them .
1	i love this cd , i have listened to it several time and i am enjoying it ! i am not a fan of e.s . posthumus , however . not by choice , by necessity . i just have to get through the rest of the cd before i start listening to him .

0	billie joe armstrong is a great singer . this is a nice song .
0	i just bought this album and i am very excited . i think this album is better than the singer previous album . she is still very good , but i think the last two album have been better . i think she is not really that great of a singer , but she doe have some very good song . i have not listened to all the song yet , but i do not think there is anything off-putting . the album is a little more country , a little more rock , but i still think it is a good album .
0	i really liked this song , i had never heard it and now i know why . i remember the song because it sounded like the beatles and i love them . i also like this song because the chorus is so good and you can have a complete song by singing the first two line together . i think this would have been a good song if the second half of the song wa sung by someone else . i do not know what i would change to make this a better song , but the song wa fine .
0	this is another jewel album . i love the first two jewel album . this one is not a good a the first two .
1	hasselvander is a very talented musician . i have no fear about the song that he wrote . hasselvander is a very talented man . i bought his song from itunes . hasselvander is a very talented musician . i bought his song from itunes . hasselvander wrote the song .

0	i have always liked the guitar work and the vocal but i am not that impressed with the rest of the song on this cd . the song dance ( lovin you ) is one that never made it onto any of the cd i have bought . the other song i do not see myself listening to again . the song candyland is annoying but i do not think it would be a big deal if i did not like it .
0	i am glad i found this song , that is what the video is about . i like the lyric and the music is good . there is a lot of energy in this song . i think it will be a good cd . i will keep this cd in my cd player .

0	i love this song , but i do not understand why it is not on the cd . this is the same song , but it wa not on the album . it is a better version though , so it is still good .
0	yes , this is a joke . yes , they did try and sing along with this song . it is just that the quality of the song is so out-of-focus , it sound like they can not even hear the lyric . the band itself wa supposed to be a joke , but it just sound like crap , which is what happens when you mix a great song with a crappy band .
1	i love the song .
1	if you like bob dylan , this is a must listen . it is a good song , but i think it is a bit different from all other song that bob dylan ha written to date . for some reason , i like it .
0	i wa looking forward to this album and i wa prepared to like it . i had heard great thing about the band , but i wa not prepared to listen to this and be disappointed . i do not think that i wa even interested in this album , but i ended up listening to it because i wa curious . this wa not the best release by the dave clark five , but it wa one of the better one .
0	she had a lot of good song and she got some decent number . not the best , but the song are good . the song are not the best though , the lyric are terrible .
0	lorde is just a really bad singer and the lyric fall short . her voice is not great , and i do not like the song .
0	this album is not meant to be listened to on any device other than a cd player . not even a ipod .
1	this is one of her best song . it is a great song and you can tell that she did a great job with it . it is not a bad song and it ha a catchy chorus . it is a good song and it is a great song . the only thing i do not like about it is that it sound like a country song . but it is definitely a country song , and i think that country is great and i like it . i would buy this song over most other cover . it is pretty good and it is a good song .
1	this album wa released in 1989 , and it seems to be a great example of what a record company could do with a new band . i like the song , and would like to hear more from them . i also do not think this is a great classic rock album , but it is not awful either . i do like the cover .

1	this album ha several great song . i would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates jeff buckley and john mayer .
0	well this album is not bad , it is just not great . this is a good album if your looking for a good album and you can not find that on a lot of them . i mean , there is nothing to be found here , or at least not from what i have heard .
0	this album ha good song .
0	this is a bad effort by ms. ponder to promote her book . i wa hoping that the short performance of the prince of denmark would be different , but it is just an old-fashioned love song . i do not think a recording of ms. ponders voice performing the song is worth that much of a song . it wa done on a cassette recorder and would have been better off recorded in a studio . i listened to two song on this recording , but only heard one half of it . i know the prince is a popular figure , but this is just a silly effort to sell book series .
0	this is a great album . the first song is a cover of a song by the beatles . a far a i know , it is the only time this song ha been covered by another artist .
0	i bought it to make a cd for my car .
1	it is rare to get a live recording of a prince concert . this cd is perfect . i do not know how i got it , but i think it wa bought from kinkos . it is been in my cd player for at least a month now and i just can not get enough of it . the show wa very well recorded and the sound quality is great . the crowd is loud and the band is very professional . and no doubt some of the best musician prince ever worked with . it is a great little gem and i hope they make a second cd ! the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because they played the song i did not get through the night , you and me . when i got home i looked it up and wa shocked at how much this song is in the medium , and i did not know it wa on this cd . i hope prince make more of these cd .
1	i do not know where i got this song , but i like it .
0	this is from the man who sang the boy is mine . the lyric are from his father- he doe not seem to be a very good father . when he finally did come home after a very long time , he came home with a bottle of whiskey and told my husband and i he wa sorry for breaking up with the kid , but he could not stop thinking about them . he wa sorry . we did not drink or take his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long time . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about the kid . we did not drink , but we did not stop his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long while . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about u . we again did not drink or drink his whiskey . he wa a very nice person who we did not want to do harm to . we did not want to do harm to him either .
1	i bought this cd on cd , vinyl , cassette , and now mp3 download . i wa lucky enough to get an original copy . it is fantastic . best album of all time .
0	i wa really hoping to like this cd , but i did not . i am a huge jazz fan and this cd is not jazz , it is more like a crappy jazz album . the only reason i gave it a 4 star rating is because it is a cd that is in the jazz genre . it is hard to believe that this album is called her album . it is not hip-hop , soul , or blue . it ha a lot of hip-hop and soul music . i hope that this cd can be re-released with her name on the cover .
1	i love this man and this album is one of the best r kelly album in my opinion .
1	i love this cd , the original first i have heard of it , the lyric are great and the song title are funny , the music is great , and i like the song hey baby the most .

1	the music is very well produced and i think the song is also very well produced . this is a great album . the song are all well written and played .
1	this is one of the most overlooked trance album . the only reason i bought this instead of state of trance wa because i wa really excited about the state of trance album cover , and i did not know what to expect from it so i just bought it . this album is great music . the quality is amazing . the mixing is amazing . the song choice are diverse and the song themselves are great . i really recommend this album to everyone .
0	the new album is very good . the vocalist are amazing . the album is very well done . i would like to listen to the two song that i have not heard before . i am glad that i found this album .

1	her voice is incredible . i love her singing .
0	this song represents my personal opinion of keith . it is about his mother . i hate her . my mom is not a good person . i only wish she would die and i would be happy . i wish he would stop making bad song . he is a voice to be heard . he will be in my heart .
0	the cd wa good , but it is not a good way to help her relax . the song on this cd were very soothing . the song on this cd were good . the song did not go with the theme of the cd . the song on her cd were better on another cd . the song on her cd were better on another cd .

0	i have bought many album on amazon and never had any problem with the shipping , or the quality of the music . this time i have to say i wa very disappointed . i ordered this cd from amazon . it is a cd with an 8 disc compilation . there are 4 cd in total - and all 4 cd have the same music on them . the only difference of any kind is that one cd is a compilation ( all song performed by the same artist ) and the other 4 cd are all by different artist . the cd with all the song by the same artist is called classic . i ordered this cd and it say it ha a cd of all the song by the same artist , but i just do not recall getting this cd . i do not remember ever buying this cd . the only cd i have ever bought on amazon that i remember were cd of the same artist . i also ordered the cd that came with this cd - it wa a cd of a concert . the concert wa for the artist x. i do not remember if i bought this cd . i do not remember when the concert wa . i should probably go back and check the cd i bought on amazon . but i am sure the cd i bought all had the same artist in them . if i had to go by the description or the cd cover , i would say it is false advertising . i can not remember ever buying this . it certainly is not a cd i would have remembered buying if i had purchased this .
0	i listened to this album a lot while growing up , but i can not remember if i ever bought it , or if someone gave it to me . i think i wa about 11 , maybe 12 , so i can not be very sure , but i certainly remember liking the song .
0	i am so excited to get my hand on this cd . i have been waiting for it for a very , very long time now .
1	this is the first cd i have ever heard that ha sam singing . i really like this cd , but i wish he would sing something different . the song is good , but the repetitive lyric are annoying . i would like to listen to it a few time , but other than that , i think this cd is good .
0	i have a feeling this song is going to be very popular in the blue circle . in fact , i think it will be a hit .
0	this is one of my favorite indie album . it ha a great mixture of new and old song . they are a must for any indie fan .
1	i bought this cd and wa very surprised . i could not believe my ear . the song are all about love . the song are all about hope , faith , and the word of god . the song are great ! this is one of the best cd i have ever heard .
1	the cd is great . it ha a lot of good quality song that are also very easy to listen to , not too fast and not too slow .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to buy a new cd and they offered it a a freebie . i will probably buy another cd by this artist in the future . i will be buying the new one . this cd sound really cool with fun lyric , but , it is not for me .
1	i love this song . bonnie tyler is an amazing musician .
1	excellent song , great for the holiday season .

1	i have listened to this album and loved it very much . i got it for my birthday . i have listened to it a few time . i like the song . i like the voice . it is a good album .

1	i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great . i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great !
0	i have been looking for a new album for quite a while now and i think i have found it . it is great and it is different and i am really happy with it . a great record by a great band . i can not wait to hear it live and play it .
0	this cd , while it is a fine recording , just doe not have enough punch to be considered great jazz . it doe have a great sound and the song are excellent , but it just doe not have enough substance to it to be considered great jazz .
1	i do not listen to tom scott enough but this album caught my attention when it wa first released . it wa a bit hard to listen to at first , but i actually found myself enjoying these tune more and more a the album went on . they are not necessarily unique but they are very well done and have a lot of energy to them . i have listened to this album a lot and i am glad to say i did not get bored of it . it is a great album to have on when you want to get down with your friend and when you want to dance and have some fun . i would recommend this to any tom scott fan and to anyone who like a good mixture of pop and rock .
1	this is definitely one of the best cd i have ever purchased . the song are very good , and the vocalist is very good . i have listened to other cd , and this cd is better than other cd . i have listened to this cd almost every day for several week . i would suggest buying this cd .
1	i have not listened to this cd personally , but i have heard the cd . i have read many review of this song , and i have read that it is a good song . i agree with them . this is a great song .
1	the song is simple , but it doe what it doe . the rhythm is simple and the lyric are simple , and for me , that is all that matter . it also ha a nice sound quality , but i will take the song over the video anyway .
0	this is the best compilation tape of all time . i have always listened to the soundtrack album and have never had a tape like this come out , but it is still really good . the best song on this tape are rough and let u get rocked by the runaway . the soundtrack album are also good , but they do not have a many song and are just a bit more boring , especially if you are a huge fan of 80 music . this tape is a lot more fun , and it ha a much larger selection , with song by artist such a the replacement , the clash , janes addiction , the ramones , the offspring , the smashing pumpkin , and so much more .
0	i bought this album because it wa on sale . i thought it would be worth it . it wasnt .
0	i do not have much to say about this album . i do not really listen to new release often , but i have been listening to this album for quite a while and i really like it .

0	i am a classical music listener and have had the chance to listen to many of these artist over the year and have a collection that is quite complete . i have owned and listened to many of these artist for year and have always enjoyed the music . i have purchased this many time and had no problem with the quality of the music . if it is a good disc , it is a good disc . i have no idea what kind of music is on this disc , but i am going to listen carefully and find out .
1	i am an old school music lover . i love the classic . i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajian from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerising . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped from the orchestra . it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence . that is , the sound is now buried to it very core . it is in moment like this when the listener is treated to something truly memorable .
0	this is a great cd . the music is good . the picture , however , are very low quality . i have never heard such poor picture of a movie . this cd is a must have .
1	this is just great ! i love it !
0	i wish i could rate this song lower , but it just doe not do it for me .
1	i really like this cd . i like the song no hand very much . i do not know why , but i like bruno mar . i like the song no hand . i think the song no hand is one of the best song bruno mar ha ever written .
1	i have always been a fan of jp . i love his playing and i love his singing . i just do not think he is the kind of guy to be a big name in music . but i really like his sound . i just wish he would be a little more experimental . i wish he would do more guitar solo and be a little more experimental .
1	this album is fantastic . the last three album that the band ha released have been nothing short of amazing . this album is no different . it is fantastic . it may not be the best album of their career , but it easily rank among their best .
1	this is one of my favorite . i like how it sound like a song that is still being recorded .
0	i really liked this cd . i thought her voice wa awesome .
1	i like this album a lot . i love the car song and the song on this album especially . i also like the sound of the album . i wish that they would make better album . i have to say that i am a little bit disappointed by the fact that they are not on the radio anymore . the lead singer , gary daniel , is not a good a he wa . he is not too bad , but he is not a great singer . i am a little disappointed that they are not playing anymore . i am a little disappointed that they are not playing you aint woman enough anymore . i guess i am supposed to be a little disappointed that they are not playing the longest yard . i like the song the longest yard , but i think that this song is supposed to be played on the radio . i like their new album , but i think that they are not going to be on the radio anymore . i just think that they should be on the radio , and i guess i am supposed to be a little bit disappointed that they are not . i have to say that this album is one of the best album that i have ever heard . i also like that this album ha a little bit of everything . i love the song on this album . i also like the sound of the album . so this album is really a lot of fun . i also like the lead singer , gary daniel , who is really cute . i just want to say that he is a great singer . i just want to say that he is one of the greatest singer in the history of music . i just want to say that he is a great singer who need to be on the radio more . i wish that they would make better album . this is one of the best album that i have ever heard . the lead singer , gary daniel , is really cute . the lead singer , gary daniel , is really cute .

1	i have been listening to this cd for a few day now and i must say i am surprised by the quality and quantity of the song . at first i thought it wa a one time thing , but now i am beginning to wonder if there will be another cd just like it . i have a feeling it is going to be a real hit . for the first time in my life i am listening to a cd that is so good you can not stop .
1	love this song . wish he would go back to his old stuff .
1	i don think i would have listened to this cd if it wasnt for this one . i found it very relaxing and soothing . it ha a good blend of blue , country , jazz and pop style . the instrumentals are nice and the vocal blend with the instrumental very well . i like the way it ha a nice bluesy feeling . if you like a bluesy feel this would be a good start to get the ballad going .

1	this is a great song . i like the guitar part , and the lyric are very good .
0	i think i enjoyed the last record but this one is ok
0	is a nice album but it ha some very obvious error . one song ha a word written backwards and the word in the song are scrambled . the album cover are also quite poor . this is a very good album , but if you do not own the cd and need to listen to it , you can not get past the packaging .
1	the best of the cd on this album is my choice . it is not a great song but it is a great song . jvj wa a young man who is life wa cruelly taken from him . this song is his way of coming back to life .

1	i do not know what it is about the 90 that they have this album available on so many streaming service all at the same time . not much of a cd , but it is great that this album came out in the 90 . it is the kind of music that you would expect to find on a 90 compilation .

0	i thought sam sparro wa a rocker but this is far from rock . i am not a big fan of this song .
0	the lyric are great and the sound is very good . the sound is not a clear a other cd i have bought from amazon . this is not a problem with this cd .
0	i have never heard this song before , so i am trying to find out if it is good or bad . i think it is good , but maybe not for everyone .
1	this is okay , but it is not good . the vocal are okay and the instrumentation is fine . it is a good song .
0	this album ha a great sound . great lyric . love the beatles .
0	i think she sound better at the end of the song . i just can not get into it at the beginning of the song .
0	i have never been a big prince fan . i used to think he wa a genius , but now i am a fan . i wa a fan of the purple rain movie and the diamond and pearl movie . i think his music helped me overcome my love of the movie purple rain . i also loved his music in the purple rain and raspberry beret movie . i bought this album because it wa one of his last studio album . i love this album for all of these reason .
0	i have purchased several different tom wait cd . i have never come across a tom wait cd that i did not enjoy . he ha always been able to make a cd that i am happy to listen to . i also like tom wait because he ha a voice that ha an ability to carry a tune . he always sound like he is singing . he is one of those artist that when i hear his music i just want to dance . his music is very mellow sounding . his music can be played at any time of the day .
0	i bought this new cd just to have a listen to it . i have been listening to the pretender record since i wa 11-16 , but this album ha a totally different sound , and i did not know that this wa the pretender that bonnie had been working on . i like the old song on this album , but i do not know if i can take listening to this album anymore .

1	i am a big fan of christina and this album is absolutely beautiful . i love her song , and this album is a wonderful mix of her song and the song by other artist . i love it . i would love to have an album like this , and i am sure i will .
0	this cd is not worth listening to . it sound like a demo tape or a poor quality recording . the vocal are okay , but the bass sound very bad . and the other instrument sounded good , but the bass drowned everything out . the only thing that stood out wa that the drummer did a great job on the bass drum . and i wa actually impressed . the bass is not what make the record bad . the main bad thing is that i can not figure out what song this is . i have no idea what instrumentation this is , but there are a few instrument that all sound the same . but there are no vocal . and the song is very short . i think it is a great song , but i can not figure out what it is . if there wa a bassline , maybe it would have been better . but there wa nothing .
0	it is a pretty decent recording . this is the first cd of the dave clark five new cd , but it is the last one . they are very much their normal self . i would have loved to hear this cd recorded without the backing of the band , and then mixed much better .
1	i love his voice . i really , really like this song .
1	i purchased this album after listening to it on my iphone .
0	i have not listened to jp recently , but this is a great album , especially i will fly away . he also play some great solo on the last couple of track of the album . i am very disappointed that the song ave maria is only about half way thru . i liked the song and the soloing on it , but it just seems to end on a whim , a if jp wa done . it doe not seem to have any ending whatsoever , and the soloing seems to end with the last note . i am sure he would have liked the song , but i am not sure why it wa so drastically cut .
0	i like him .

1	great album , and great music !
0	i heard this song last night . i wa surprised at how much i liked it . it is a catchy song .
1	an excellent album . this album ha a lot of energy to it . it is got a great feel to it .
0	the song wa actually written by gary moore , but he wasnt able to get a record deal with the label , so they had a local artist perform the song instead . this guy performed it at the last show , and it wa a hit . so the song wa rerecorded . the song ha been released on many album , but no matter what you do , this song will never be a good a it wa when it wa first recorded . to be fair , the band had a great song , and this is one of their weaker recording .
0	this is a very good song . i like the cover very much . i will buy this song . the only problem is that i do not have a cd player .
1	this song wa originally only sung by the late great jim reef , but ha since been sung by many others including bob smith , gary moore , and others .
0	this is a very nice cd . i love it . it is nice to listen to .
1	the band is a great band . i love the song ! this is a great song to rock out to .
0	i would like to give a positive rating for this album but it will have to remain a negative one because this album is so bad . the music is so bad that i feel that for the price of this album i would have purchased a cd of random song from the radio that wa on one of the many channel . this album ha so much potential and i would have bought it if i knew what it wa . this album is very similar to the temptation album in that the music is bad , the song are very short and are taken out of context . the only redeeming factor about this album is the name of the band . the name of the band is the prince collection and it is very clever since there are so many great prince song that have not been on any recording and are on this cd . the song in this cd are all very short and are taken out of context and are used in an attempt to sell this cd . this is a horrible album that ha a lot of potential and would be good if this wa the last cd that wa released .
0	this is the end of your idol career . and i had to say so . i am so disappointed . this wa a great idol experience . i have been waiting for her to release another cd .
0	i got the music for my brother birthday . he had a hard time finding the right song . this one is one i can think of . it is a pop song . very soft . the song is for a girl day .
0	i am just a really bad blogger , and i really did not even know of this jazz lp . it wa really nice , and the sound make me want to get my hand on a copy . i only wish i could have bought the whole cd . i love the way this music sound . it make me feel like i am in a small room with a saxophone .
1	i have listened to this song so many many time i lost count . i love this song . i do not know why i had never heard of him . this guy wa a hero . i used to be a nurse . i remember a lot of people dying in the hospital . this song should get a star . it is a great feeling good song . i love the positive message . this guy wa an hero .

1	i am not a fan of the hurt singer , but i am not going to get into too much detail here . i just wanted to say the song is a blast . it is an easy listen , with powerful , yet simple , lyric . it is like a bluesy version of the song piece of mind with a heavier attitude . the song is played by an excellent band , including a very underrated guitarist , and i highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for the classic rock of the 60 .
0	this song is good , but the album is not .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .

1	the beatles were my first love , and the only beatles disc i own . i have been a fan for over 30 year and am just a enthralled with the boy a i wa in my early teen , when i first came to england . i love them for their music , for their song , and for their personality . when i hear their music , i am transported to a world that had nothing to do with the music i grew up with .

0	this song is not a good song .
0	i wa looking forward to it . i wa excited to get it . i wanted to hear it . i wish i had not because when i listened to it i wa disappointed . it will never be something i return to . i do not think it is going to ever be a good a it is made out to be . in the end , it wa the sound quality that kept me from picking it up . i just do not think it is a good a it is made out to be . it is kind of a disappointment .
1	another fantastic album full of wonderful music !
0	i have been searching for information about the artist for a few year . i just recently found your website , and have been listening to a lot of her album . i am a musician , so this is the first album i have purchased . i love it !
1	the recording in this set are absolutely wonderful , and there are plenty of them . i am not sure i realized that i had not heard this piece live before , but it is a delight to listen to this recording of the 1812 overture . the performance is full of emotion , and it is a real treat to be able to hear the soloist and the orchestra . i am impressed by beethoven mastery of orchestration , and this recording provides a great introduction to the beethoven symphony .
0	i am not sure it is a good song . it ha a good groove and the chorus is catchy . but it is not a great song . it is just over the top and i do not think that it is very catchy or good in any way . so i give this a 2 star rating .
0	the dave clark five were the beatles of the 60 . i wa a big fan of their work and would listen to most of their song when i wa in 8th and 9th grade . i wa lucky enough to get their first album the nylon curtain in the mail . i really enjoyed the song on this cd , and i would listen to it again . now , i am a big fan of the dave clark five . i have listened to the cd of them over and over again . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like their music .

1	this is a good album that i will put on when i am feeling a little down . the music is very relaxing and pleasant to listen to .

1	i love this cd and have listened to it several time in the past few week . i really like the music and the message .
1	jp is one of the few guitarist playing today who is not a carbon copy of jim hall and john fahey ( in my opinion ) . this album is a great fusion of all style jp ha been playing for some time and his playing on ave maria is superb . the soloing on i will fly away is excellent too . i only wish he could have a more balanced recording to compare with the multi-instrumental album he ha played in the past . ( i do not think he is ever made a recording that i do not like , and a far a i know he is never released an instrumental album ) .
1	i loved this album . this is a great album .

1	i wa looking for a new version of this classic , but found none . this version is very good . the lyric are great , and the instrumentation is excellent .
0	this is a song that wa played on the radio by a long-time rock station in the early 1970s . it wa part of a program , but i really liked the original version better than the one on this cd . i used to drive by the little radio station on my way to and from work every day and see this song , almost every time , when i would pas by . it is not bad . a little boring . it is just a song . it is the kind of song that you listen to while waiting or just to have something to watch while you wait . i love it and i love the song . it is a good song . this cover is pretty bad . there is no real reason to use this song . this just seems like another attempt to cash in on a hit . it doe not work and it is just a bad version of a classic .
1	i think this song is awesome . it ha a great beat , and it get stuck in my head . i have never been able to stop whistling it . it is a great song .

0	this song ha a great chorus , but the lyric suck .
0	i wa told that this wa a cd with only one track , but when i listened to it , i found out that it wa the entire cd . this wa the same cd that wa in state of trance 2007 , but this cd ha more track of the same type of music that wa in 2007. this is a waste of my time , and money . if you are a state of trance fan , you will want to buy this cd , but it is just not worth the money .
1	i really like the music and lyric of this album . i think it is a good album .
0	this one is awesome ! i have never seen it used in my show , but the crowd love it .
0	i bought this set of recording from the record label omni . i thought that the recording were excellent , but i wa surprised that when i went to play them in my studio they sounded very dull , uninspired and lifeless . i wa told that the recording were made originally a a sound track for a film but that the recording quality wa poor .
1	i really like this song . i just bought it to give to my sister . she really enjoys it .
0	most song were the same . she sings better by herself .

0	this suck ! this is the worst song from r.kelly .
0	i have seen this cd on amazon for over a year and i have never bought it . i do not know why . i saw that it wa available on itunes , but i have not ordered it . what i have instead is a cd of music from a friend and i like the song a lot . i think this would be a good addition , but i am not really going to pay any price of $ 60 for this . i am just not . i think hasselvander is an idiot for writing these review . this is not worth buying . it is a waste of money . you would think that he would just buy the cd himself , which is what i would do in his place . i would not buy this for $ 60 .
1	this song sound awesome .
0	i bought her last album , and it is my favorite . i have been buying this for a year and a half , and i have loved it every time . i think she should keep the same style , but improve it a lot . i just do not understand why she started changing it up . i do not know if the album is good .
0	i like brandy . she is so beautiful .
0	it is good .
1	the best trance album i have ever heard ! if you did not already know this , this is the best trance album i have ever heard !

0	this album is a wonderful combination of the two thing i love the best : classic rock , and country music . i love the way song like i aint gon na teach your momma to walk , all in my head and it is gon na be alright mix rock vocal , with smooth country-sounding guitar .
0	one of the great album from the 90 . it wa my first real rock album . it had a great feel to it . the sound and feel wa the best of the 90 . it had a lot of great song that were well arranged . i love the music , but i think the production is a bit weird . it is good , but it is weird . it is just not the most memorable album in my opinion .
0	i have seen this cd on the radio , and i wa excited to get it . it music is very nice ! it is a good collection of song , but i would not buy this cd .
1	this is probably my favorite song so far . it is a very good song , and i think that it is just a good with or without the choir .
1	this is my life by r kelly is a good song , but i wa disappointed because it is more on the level of a typical jesus is all i need than a real jesus is all i need that i am familiar with .
1	it wa a good thing that i left my cell phone in the car , because i could not wait to get in the vehicle to listen to this album . i am not familiar with the music , but i know that it is popular . i wa surprised that it is a live recording , which i have never heard before . the first time it came on the radio i wa so excited , i jumped off the sofa to get the radio . i am glad that i left my cell phone in the car so i could listen to it without interruption .
0	i am a fan of the artist and the music . i did not like the song played this time . it wa just one of the song that were played repeatedly throughout the show . i do not know if it wa because of the song or the fact i wa using itunes on a mac .
0	this is a great album . i bought it for my daughter for christmas . i think she is going to love it .
1	i have now listened to about half of the song on this collection . i have to say , that these song are all very enjoyable and have some excellent music . marie is not a great singer , but her voice is very beautiful . she sings with a wonderful , clear , and clear voice . i believe the best singer are those who can sing in several different way . marie can sing easy and then she can switch to her harder side and i find this admirable .
0	just a few more day until the release of tiger moon and i am beginning to see the light . i am a huge fan of both jewel and the dave clark five music . i will not be buying any of these three cd until the dust ha settled . this is the first time the dave clark five ha been put out on cd and it is a travesty . i will not purchase any more of their cd .
1	this song brings back memory of when i wa a teenager and my friend and i would play this song in the car and it would make me feel all happy and free . it is the song that defines my life and life .
1	so i heard this song on the radio and i remember thinking that it seemed like a bit of a novelty but then i heard it on the radio and it wa a song that would have been a smash . i wa just happy to hear it and now i know why it been stuck in my head .
1	this is a pretty good song . it is pretty mellow . the guy on the guitar is really good . he is one of the few people i can listen to for hour on end without getting bored . it is one of the few song i like in this collection . it is so good i can not stand it .
1	i am not going to waste my time and money on this cd . and i can not stand the music . i do not like the song .
0	i love this album , it is the best trance i have heard in a long time .
0	i am a huge brandy fan , so i really like her song .
0	i wa wondering what is wa about ? i like the song stuck in the middle with you but i do not like the other song very much . the vocal on do not let me down and honey do not are awesome . the other song are just good to listen to and doe not really take the album anywhere .
1	i purchased this album on a whim after seeing it on the cover of the top album to buy . i listened to it while my husband wa out of town and it really did get me thinking and make me feel like i just lost my mind . it is a really great album , and i find r.kelly to be a very nice person .
0	this version of the song is very good !
0	i love this song . it is a great song . i would definitely buy it again .
1	i like that it is very short , but i do have to admit it is very easy to get bored with .
0	i have already bought this cd . i have heard her cd before . i am pretty sure i like both of them . i just do not love her voice .
1	this album ha a great mixture of classic rock and pop music . i love the singer and her music . i hope we get to see them on stage soon .
1	this is a song that ha me jumping out of my shoe , cry and laughing . it ha been a constant in my life from my childhood to now . this song ha always made me think and feel . i remember getting lost in this song . it still brings me back to those time . i love this song .
0	i ordered this book from amazon and it came today . it wa a little heavy . i thought it wa a book about woman in the 1960s . i thought maybe it wa a book about men in the 1960s . it is not in the subject area that i thought it wa . i think it is a book about woman in the 1960s . i will be using it - but i will probably be keeping it in a drawer . i can not figure out why i do not like it . i would think it would be worth buying , but it doe not seem to be any good .
1	this cd of the who is saturday night live performance is superb . i have yet to hear a bad song on this cd . i do find that the recording sound a little low , but it is still a great recording . i love this recording because i like the sound of the studio .
1	this is the best miley song i have ever heard , it ha so many word , i know i will be singing this forever .

1	a very good trance track but it need to be heard to be believed .
0	this is the most complete recording of the work of george gershwin . this is a wonderful set with a wonderful performance by the great classical pianist michael tilson thomas .
0	i have played this album for year , and i really enjoy listening to it . the only problem is the lyric .
1	it is an amazing album i listen to this album over and over again .
0	this is not a good album at all . it is not the sound , but the fact that it is from the 50 . that is all it is good for . i have listened to a few other album from the 50 and even those are worse . this album is not worth the money , imo . i am sorry that i lost $ 150.00 . i would like to give it one star so i can complain more about it . this album is not worth the money , imo .
0	this is not a very good song . the song wa good until the 2nd verse . after that , it became really bad . on the last 3 verse , it is just not a good song . the guitar playing is good , but the lyric are too repetitive . the guitar playing just doe not match the song . and the lyric just do not flow . it is not too bad , but it is not a good song either .
1	lareine is a very good singer and she can sing better now , but she doe not have an original style .
0	it is the same song , with the same band , and it is not the same song . it is a live version of the song .

0	i want you to know that i am happy with the music i have heard from the dave clark five , say robert plant . from what i have heard on this record , i think it is the best i have heard . from what i have heard from them in the past , i have high hope for them . it is time to go on . but i am not going to take any of them back into the studio .

1	this wa one of the first album i bought ( in the late 80 ) . it wa one of the first song i played on guitar . i can not believe the last time i played this song wa when i wa 13 and i wa listening to a cassette copy of it . it is so very cool . i wish there wa a better recording . i still listen to this song quite often . i think it is a must have for any guitar fan .

0	not my favorite , but i have heard it plenty of time and i have no problem with it . i would say , though , that this album is a bit of a ripoff of the first two-thirds of his first album . while the first two-thirds were not terribly bad , the third part wa .

1	this is a beautiful version of the steve morse classic , the hammond organ collection . if you enjoy the late 70s/early 80 , this is a must buy .
0	this is one of my favorite jazz recording . the song is also good . i do not care about the music . what i care about is the song . this is an excellent representation of james brown . i would love to hear what the band did in the 1970s , but i do not know how to find it . i would love to hear this version on a compilation . unfortunately , it is not available . it would be almost a perfect combination of james brown and bob dylan . i would like to hear this version on the compilation of bob dylan best song .

1	this is an absolutely gorgeous album , a well a a very good song . it is also the first album that i own by the band that i have listened to for every song . i do not think i have ever bought an album by a band that i have listened to every song on . i had to buy this one , because i wanted to hear sweet jane and you do not know me .

1	i really like bonnie raitts voice and the music she sings . this album ha some of her best song and some of her best tune .
0	just wanted to write that i can not stand this song . i find it repugnant and offensive . i find it depressing . very sad and depressing . i have always been a fan of gospel music . but , i do not like the modern gospel . i have been married to a man for 11 year . and , for the last 4 year , he ha been a very abusive and horrible man . ( i have to live in the middle of nowhere to get away from him ) i would love to hear some positive song . if i could buy one cd that just had positive song , i would buy many . but , the tune for me is god not dead . it is so positive . i am happy . i do not have to listen to the rest of the hit on this cd . i like the song that are spiritual . but , i do not like the song that make fun of and mock god . it is just a really bad song . i bought it 3 time so far . i am waiting for the 4th cd . it is supposed to be the best . i am not sure . i am not sure i will like it . i think it is going to be a waste of my money . i am going to give it to my son . he is 12 and like it . but , my son is gay . i do not think this could be a good message to have for him . i have heard it . i have not listened to it . i am just going to put it on my ipod and listen to it . i will let you know what i think of it . i hope it is the best . it wa my first choice . it is my second choice . it is my third choice . i am only going to write one negative review on this cd . if i do not like it , i will write two or three . but , i do not have to .
1	this song is so beautiful . i love this song . the lyric are beautiful . i love the way it is sung . this is a great song . i have been listening to it for a while . i love it .
1	i would like to hear this song again . it is my favorite song i have ever heard in my life . it is a great song . i have read review of this song saying it is not a great song . i do not listen to song like that . this song is a great song and it is the song that made me fall in love with this cd . i have a lot of favorite and i think this is the best .
0	it is an album of good song , and the melody are great , but the lyric are terrible .
0	i wa so disappointed in this cd . i bought this cd because it wa a must have for our wedding . we were supposed to have a live band for our wedding , but it wa not to be .
1	i bought this album because i like to be surprised .
0	i am going to take a moment to let this guy know he should get a life . he is a very talented artist and doe not deserve to have a record company waste their time on something so badly written and sung .
0	it is good !
1	the song is very catchy and you can hardly stop dancing to it .
1	i love this singer
1	i have listened to this cd a few time . i like it .
0	i have listened to this song since before the movie wa made . i used to listen to it all the time .
0	this is not a very good song . i do not like the style of the song . the song is not very good at all .
0	this song is so great . this song is one that everyone should listen to .
0	i had a few idea for a song that would be perfect for the site . i tried one in 5 minute and wa happy with the end result . it wa a hit . i now have a song that i will play regularly . the other song are much better though . no complaint . i have a few idea for song to make the site even more awesome . i will probably do them a i go .
1	i have heard this song before , but i never knew what a great song this is .
0	i wish i could find a copy that i could play in the car .
0	i do not like this song , but i like the music in it . it is a good song and it is a real nice song , but my problem with it is that it is over produced and over done . i do not know where most of the good music is coming from , there are no original idea , it is just music that is been done so many time it doe not sound new anymore . this song is over produced and is over played by about 2:00 in . it is a song that is been done so many time it is no longer new , it is almost old . i do not like this song , it is one of the oldest song i have heard yet and it sound like most of the song i have heard today . i do not know why they did this , but it is just something i do not like . this is one of the worst cd that i have listened to all year . it is something i have to listen to , but i do not think i will ever listen to it again .
1	if you like this bonnie tatum cd you will love this album by bonnie tatum . i wa very excited about this album because of the word and the music . i can not wait for the next album .
1	i like it . the lyric are clever and the song is catchy .
1	this is a very good album . i am not a big fan of country music , but this artist certainly fit the bill . the song on this one are fun to listen to . i especially like that the guitar solo is a little different from every other song and it is a nice break from the typical country song .
1	i have heard a few recording of the beethoven piano concerto no . 5. this is by far the best . it is also the most accurate . it sound like the symphony actually ha a lot of life . this is not a fancy recording . it ha a very good sound quality .
0	i wa looking for a song i had heard several time and , lo and behold , i found it on this cd ! a a matter of fact , i have listened to this cd several time and have not yet found a song i like . i bought this and the 4 previous one a a part of an extensive series . i have no idea which one is which . i do not think i will be returning them . i do not even know which one is the best . however , i will tell you that the cd that is in the series is the worst i have ever heard . it is the worst . the singing in the cd is so bad that i can not believe they would go through the effort to make the cd ( and they all are quite good ) . i do not know what they are trying to sell with this series of cd .
0	i think this song is a total fail for her . it is a very average song and she is not very good at music . plus , she make a lot of very very bad ( for her ) lyric and that really ruin it for me .
1	i would recommend this to anyone who like prince . i have listened to the original album twice and i did not hear any difference . prince greatest hit is the only album i have ever listened to twice and i am still not tired of it . it is one of the best prince album i have ever heard .
1	the song on this album are all exceptional . they are really good . it is a very good album .
0	i remember listening to this song on cd . it wa one of the track on a promotional cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . i think it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching-up on some old television show and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable actor , gob , in arrested development . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this album is horrible . i bought it because it wa $ 5.00 well worth it . it is horrible . there is nothing in here worth listening to , i am almost ashamed to even have it on my cd player . the only thing i can say about it is that it is good to get a good laugh .
1	a very good album
0	this cd is excellent - i have listened to it several time and i love the guitar solo .
0	the only thing i would recommend is that they get her singing a little faster , it make the song seem much more dynamic .
0	love the album !
1	i love this music . it brings me back to a simpler time . great job guy . this song brings me back to a more simple time . great job !
1	this sound like the music of the 1960s . i like the fact she doe something different , but the music is very dated .
1	i think i would have gotten this song if i knew i would have bought it . i love it and would listen to it every day . it is one of the few song that make me think about the world and life in general .
1	i think this album is one of the best music album coming out in the last several year .
0	i love this song but it is sad to think that it will be playing for year to come on the radio . i am really disappointed that the kid and young people who buy this album are not going to get the message .
0	her voice is not bad , but i am not sure she is a gifted orator . i like her song , but i do not think she is a song writer .
1	this song ha some very nice harmonica part . i like the way they do it . i like that it doe not sound like country music .
1	i have to say that this is the best cd i have heard in a long time . i would recommend this to everyone who want to hear the music of bonnie raitt . this is a beautiful cd . the song are all great . very well sung . it is one of the best cd i have heard in a long time .
0	i ordered this cd a couple of week ago , and it came today . it is a good cd . i am not sure why , but i thought the lyric for honey do not were a little odd . but i guess that is not the most important thing when it come to purchasing a cd .
1	i did not know who wanya morris wa before downloading this song . but i like this version of the song better than the movie version .
0	i had the song oh boy sung to me by my high school choir teacher . i loved it so much that i asked him to write a song for me . he came up with this song and asked me if i would sing it to him . i said yes , and he recorded it for me .
1	a tom scott album that is more pop than rock , but ha a lot of great song , and some really good riff and melody . the album is a bit on the slow side , but i do not think it is for everyone . i think the album is a little too long and the song are a bit repetitive . this is a really enjoyable album for people who like to have fun .
0	i like the dave clark 5 song they did in the 1960s . they are very relaxing .
0	i have been listening to this album for year . i think the vocal are great , the album is great . i love the title song . i think i am going to buy the whole album . the sound is great .
0	this is not a good version . he take the best part of the song and throw in a bunch of crap lyric . the song is not all that bad but it is definitely one of the worst version i have ever heard . i think this is the worst version of i will fly away i have ever heard . i hate this version . i think it is the worst .
0	i have purchased this cd . the song are good . the recording is good . but the cd is just not that good . it is not the quality of the cd that is the problem , but the quality of the recording .
1	tom scott is a top-notch jazz musician . his music is fresh , unique , and often inspiring . i am extremely excited to hear more from tom scott . he ha a great , unique style of jazz guitar playing that i enjoy .

1	this is one of my favorite album of all time . it is so well produced . you have done it again .
0	the song she is got a place is so typical madonna . a song about an entitled woman who ha a better life than the rest of the world . it is like the story of a poor girl who is trying to get into a better school so she can get into the class that will get her a better life .

1	i am a fan of this band . my favorite song are the boy you loved and my favorite thing . i recently listened to their new album heartland and it wa a wonderful surprise to discover how good they are .
1	i bought a copy of this a year ago when i bought the cd version of lucky to be alive because the cd wa the only one that came with a bonus disc called grateful dead bootleg which included music from the dead show with the dead . well , the dead bootleg wa fantastic . i just bought a copy of the dead show and i must say , the show from this night is the best of the dead from this night . it is a beautiful show and i am hoping that the dead bootleg may be released a an album . the dead bootleg is a wonderful collection of music from the dead .

1	this is a christmas album that i would recommend to everyone . this album is perfect for the holiday season . if you like traditional country music , you will love this album . i love it and i have already purchased it .
0	this is a commercial cd , because it is the latest in a line of cd to be released by a label called fwd . i own a handful of the fwd album , and this is the first cd that i have purchased that wa not worth buying . i really do not understand why i would pay this much for something that is inaudible . the music on this cd is boring and ha almost no groove . the only way this cd could have sold is if fwd put a lot of money into the design of the cd . i am sorry , but this cd is a waste of money . if you have the money to spend on this cd , go to a better label .

0	i am a bit of a classic rock fan , and i love old record . the one thing in my music collection that i wa missing , though , wa my collection of beatles record . after looking around for day , i located several used copy of the old album , and went ahead and ordered them . but i came to the sad conclusion that all of them had been cleaned and recut , and that all of them were missing the very rare , out-of-print version of the album . when i asked about it , i wa told that they had never been heard from , and that the only copy of the album in existence were the one from the 1950s that were being re-released on cd , in the hope that some people would get an opportunity to listen to them again . i am sad to say that i am not one of those people . but what i am sad about is that i have spent so much time and money on these album , and yet they have completely slipped my mind . that is a shame - i really wish i could have heard them .

1	this is a hot album . i love mileys voice and i love miley . i love the song . i love that miley is very self-aware and that she is not afraid to show her age . i love the fact that she can write her own song . i love that she can sing and write all kind of different song . i love that she is not afraid to show how old she is .
0	i thought this song wa pretty good until i heard this . i wa like , what the hell is this ? i think that is my favorite song on the album ! then i heard this shit . it is worse than what we are hearing from the grateful dead . it is terrible . i wa going to buy this off of amazon but i threw it on my ipod instead . i hope amazon doe not get sued for this one . i do not want to get sued . i have a lot of money invested in this company . this is what i am talking about . i wish that i had never bought it . i hate this version . i hope that amazon take the appropriate action . i hate this version a much a i hate the grateful dead .

1	i have heard this album on the radio several time . the album is amazing with great lyric and great music and great performance . i am glad i have decided to buy the album .
0	this song is so annoying .
0	i am a little bored with this cd . i only listened to it for a couple of minute . it wa a little too in-your-face and did not say much . i had the cd for a few day and listened to it . it reminded me of a rock band . the vocal are terrible and the music is boring . the only good thing about this cd is that it is free ! i really do not understand why anyone would pay $ 5 for something that is free . at least the cover is nice . it is very cute and it look like it is made of something other than plastic . it wa like a scratch & dent type of cover . it doe have a decent picture though . i gave it 4 star . if you are the type that like to listen to music and you are not fond of listening to a lot of boring song then this should be your first choice . i am not sure why anyone would bother paying $ 5 for a free cd . this is not a bad cd . i give it 4 star .
1	i like this very much . the vocal are pretty good . i would recommend this cd to anybody .
1	i like the song . it is upbeat , and it is fun to sing along to along with the band after it finish . the sound quality is good , but i am not sure how much i can improve the song . it sound a bit like an 80 song , but that is what i like . i will be buying the album .

0	i do not really like this album , but i do not feel like spending money on it either . i would not complain about a re-recording but i would complain that it is a re-recording of the same album - the original is much better . i do not know why keith is so popular , but he is not .
0	i have never even seen this woman in concert , but i am happy she is singing . i feel like she is a real artist and i would like to see her perform live .
1	i love this recording ! this is a great recording of our favorite song !
0	i have pre-ordered this cd but i had to return it for a reason that i will not say out loud . i could not get my hand on it once it wa released . i will not be ordering any more of mileys cd unless this is fixed . i am a huge fan of her too .

1	the song is catchy , the message is good , and the instrumentation is great .
0	i love this album . i wa really disappointed in the cd i purchased in the mail . i am not talking about the cd itself , i am talking about the packaging . i wa really impressed with the artwork on the cd and wa even more impressed with the packaging . it wa all nicely packaged and looked great . the cd and cd case were packaged very well and looked just like the actual cd . the cd wa packaged in a very nice sleeve and the cd case wa packaged in an equally nice sleeve . the cd is all right , it is not perfect . i do not have a lot of complaint about the music , but the packaging wa not up to my expectation . the cd could have been handled more professionally .
1	i have been a fan since 2004. i am a fan of lareine . i am also a fan of allan bole .
1	this is the best radio show i have heard in a long time !
1	this song is about doing what god ha called you to do . i believe this is the best song ever . the fact that i thought this wa the best version of this made me listen to the original even more .
0	i think this sound like a great cover of a great song . i will be honest , i do not love it , but i do enjoy it . i would listen to this cover over the original .
0	this album is just a big rip off of nirvana and the beatles , not only of those band but of any band out there that is trying to get noticed . i do not understand how the man can get away with this . this is a total rip off of the beatles and nirvana !

0	i love the song and the harmony . it doe not matter that it is a live cd .
0	this is a very good gnr cover , but not the best version of the song . i personally like this better than the original version . the original is a bit boring and the vocal sound like a 12 year old singing with his sister .
1	i bought it to listen to it but when i opened it the cd wa cracked . it is now in a new case . it ha now passed the crack test and i am very happy with it .
0	i do not know what happened to the other reviewer who said i do not care if it is not a masterpiece , this is probably the best album i have ever heard . but it is a masterpiece . it is an album worth paying for . the music is beautiful , the arrangement are beautiful , the lyric are beautiful , the recording is beautiful , and the production is beautiful . it is the best of karajan .
1	i have had this cd for a long time and i still listen to it . it is really good for an old cd . the main reason i like this album is because i can listen to it all the time . i am glad that someone who ha had this album for a long time still listen to it .

0	i like some of cash more uptempo song , but this is more of a slower , mellower song .

0	this song is about being a strong person in a world that is hostile to them . i do not care how much you love god , what kind of a person you are , or how much you love your family , the world out there is hostile to you . even the one who love you . i do not care if you are the most important person in the world , you do not get to be the most important person in the world . it is about being a strong person in a world that is hostile to them .

1	karajan is perhaps the most underrated singer-songwriter in the history of music ; there are countless album of his song that have yet to be heard on any kind of commercial scale . he ha a gift for expressing emotion in his music that few other artist can match . his song have a universal quality . the song that stand out from the others are love is in the air , love is in the air , the sound of music and the first time ever i saw your face . for him , the music wa just another form of art , and he wa just another person who wa simply a musician . despite his seemingly humble background , the man had an insatiable hunger for creativity and musical expression . his song have been performed by many famous artist over the year , including : james taylor , billy joel , the beach boy , the eagle , david bowie , sting , david bowie , leonard cohen , paul simon , john denver , david cassidy , billy joel , and many others . karajans music ha been covered by many other artist , including : don henley , the eagle , the beach boy , george michael , john denver , and many others . he ha been inducted into the songwriter hall of fame and is also one of the few musician to have been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame .

1	this album is the closest i have come to a jukebox for many year . that is to say , i like one song and it is the one that i replay over and over again . there is also an interesting story behind this particular album . in the 60 and 70 , i wa a member of a gospel band called the goodman . they had several album , most notably just a little love . although the song gone to earth wa on that album , i wa really proud of the song my soul . i did not think it would get any airplay , but it did . then , i wa offered a part in a tv show called the crossroad . i accepted and sang a number of song for that show . the show wa a success , and we had a great time doing it . i wa asked to go out and record a gospel duet with one of the singer from that tv show . i told producer jimmy braly , i will do it but i will not record with someone who may not agree with me . he said , all right , just sing a duet with a guy who is more my style . so i did . my soul went great , and then i had a second request from the show to sing a duet with a singer who wa a little more conservative . i said that i would , and in exchange i wa asked to record aint no way . i have always had a love for the blue , and so i agreed . the song can not take my eye off you wa written by a lady named dorothy moore , who wa a member of the band the staple singer . this woman had a beautiful soprano voice , and she had a great voice . i am happy to say that this is not a duet , but i am happy that this song got some airplay . i believe that this is one of the best gospel song ever written . this song is a tribute to a lady named dorothy moore , who wa a member of the staple singer . she wa one of the great gospel singer of all time . when i wa asked to record this song , i wa not only happy to do it , but i wa also happy that it got some airplay .

0	
1	another very good album , i love the keyboard and the guitar , i love the vocal and the guitar solo , but i have found that there are better song that i have heard . the only reason i gave it a 9 is because i like the production , but i do not think the album is that good . the vocal are a bit annoying with the raspy note .

0	this is the first album i have heard from the wait i listened to a a kid . i had heard him on the radio , but i wa a kid , and i did not listen to much radio . i bought this album because i had just had my second car , so i needed something to listen to . i listened to this album while i wa driving my new car , and i got stuck in a bit of a rain . so i would listen to this album , put my car in drive and then go back to the radio . then i would listen to it again . it wa a good way to pas the time . i am not sure it is a good album , but it is not a bad one , either . i like his humor , and it is got some good song . i wasnt all that impressed with new orleans or do not come around here no more . i liked the devil went down to georgia a little better , but i liked tequila sunrise better .

0	i wa a massive eye fan when i wa in high school , and i wa disappointed when i first heard this album . so i got the old lp and enjoyed it . a i got older , i saw the movie and the album and wa blown away . it ha a great rhythm section , great arrangement , and is a great soundtrack for a live performance .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard . the guitar is superb , and the sound quality is excellent .
0	i loved this song , but it had a lot of singing and it wasnt very long .
1	i bought this cd from amazon , it wa a good christmas present . the song are really good . the only problem is that my ipod will not play the cd . the cd is scratched on it so when you turn it on the sound will start coming out of the speaker and then it will stop . i hope that i will be able to transfer the cd to another player and then maybe it will work .
1	this is really , really pretty ! the original version is not that great . i may even buy both version !

0	i am not really a fan of the guitar player , but the guitar playing is nice . i would like to hear more of his work . i guess it would be hard to distinguish his playing from what is being played on the cd but i am sure you can make the distinction . i would really like to hear a new album . maybe a compilation of his song .
1	i thought this song wa a good one . this is a nice tune .
0	i do not like this album . i have heard it twice , both time i did not like it .
0	this is a good song , but it is a cover of a song that come from the 1930s . it is a song about the meaning of life and it is sad . it make you think and it is not a good song .
0	i used to listen to this album all the time . it wa one of my favorite album .
1	i really enjoy listening to dave clark five music . i enjoy their music so much that i have purchased both album of their music that i can still find at my house ( i am not sure how many cd i have at my house ) . i have always loved them and it is been a pleasure to watch them grow a musician . i wish them all the best !

0	a little of keith sweat like . you do recollement him , but there is nothing in this tape to remind you . it did have one song that i do not know how to describe , but it sounded like it could have been called i do not like you
1	i love this new song from you . i think it is the best song you have ever written .
0	i like barbra streisand . her voice is very powerful .
0	sam sparro is a very good singer . i really like his new album . i am not the only one is very uplifting and positive . praise is what i do is very positive and uplifting . i like the third song , praise is what i do . i like the song we are always together . the fourth song , i am not the only one is very positive and uplifting .

1	i had been looking for some new music for year . i found these guy on ebay and am very happy with my purchase . they are very talented . i love their music .
0	i bought this cd a a gift for a friend who love to sing and play piano . i will admit i like the cd , but i am not sure if i will ever buy another one . the song selection is limited ; and the album is over 2 hour . it is very poor quality . the sound quality of the recording is very poor , and the quality of the cd itself is very poor . it is very disappointing to spend this much money on a recording that will not be played in a very long time . you are wasting your money on this product . the music will play great , but there is not much of it .
0	i am a huge chris young fan , so i wa excited to have a copy of his new cd , love can not wait . i have to say that i do not think his cd is a must have , but i think it is a good cd . the only song i did not like were the one that have that he is just a singer feel to them , but there are some good song on the cd . some of them are very good . the only thing i do not like about the album is that it ha a very annoying song on it called i will be your woman that is a good song , but it sound like a remix of the bee gee song money ( that is what i want ) it is just annoying . i am not going to try to change the song , if it is there i will listen to it , but i have to say that i do not think it is very good . the album is good , but i think it is better a a single . i have to say i have heard only 2 song from the cd that i like , and i think the other song are all good , but i do not remember the name of the song i liked on the cd . it also ha a very short story on it called i have no word , which is very short . it is very short and i think it is a very good story , but i have to say that the song i liked on the cd , take me away is better , the song is good but the story is terrible
0	i have listened to this album twice , and i just do not like it . i am sure it is fantastic . but it is not my cup of tea . it is just not . it is too bland even for me . i am a fan of the music , and i love the album , but this just wasnt my kind of thing . i am not gon na give it 5 star , because i know i am not the only one . i would love to hear more of his stuff though , because i am a huge fan , and i am not sure that i can tell the difference between his playing and what he ha on this album . it is just not my cup of tea . i guess i just can not stand his playing .
0	it is one thing to listen to a cd of music by an artist you know and love ; it is another to have a cd that is a collection of song that you have never heard before . i do not know about anyone else , but i like the idea of discovering new music , but when it is a compilation of song that i have never heard , it is not a good thing .
0	this is not a very good song . i have seen it a few time , and it always make me smile .
1	i wa a bit confused when i first started listening to this cd , i thought that wa the only song on it . i decided to give it another chance and listen to the whole cd . i wa blown away by the lyric and the music . this song really touched me . i am glad i had the courage to give this cd another try .
0	it is an mp3 download . the product is exactly what wa advertised .
0	it sound amazing . i will buy it again . i like it .
0	i have to say that i had never heard of this band before but after just listening to this album i knew i had to get it . this album is a masterpiece .
0	this cd is very good for background music for one person . but what about playing the cd for other ? why people buy this is beyond me .
0	this is a fine rendition of a song . the vocal are by brandy but the song is by the dave clark five . my friend and i both agree that the song is about a bad guy .
1	this album is amazing , it is the best beatles album that i have ever heard . this wa the best beatles album in my opinion . it feature the four best beatles song in one album . i wan na hold your hand i feel fine i saw her standing there and please please me . it is one of the best beatles record ever !
0	this album is a mess . i bought it because i needed a cheap album that wasnt terrible . i am glad i got this . it is cheap . so , it is not terrible . it is just a mess . i do not like david lee roth . i hate his music . but , i am glad i bought this . it is not terrible . it is not great . it is just a mess . the worst part is that this album doe not have any of that great guitar , or vocal . it just sound like it wa made by a drunk .
1	this is an amazing album . i have been waiting for it for the longest time and i am happy i waited . this album is very good . i have listened to it a lot . i think this is an amazing album and i love her music . you will not be disappointed .
1	i really like this song !
0	this cd is by far the worst cd i have bought . i have already spent more money on this cd than i have spent on any cd i have bought in the past . this cd is so bad that i had to listen to it twice to be sure i had not bought it . i am now thinking about going back to buying my music from the dollar store . this cd is so bad that i probably would have been better off if i had just bought a cd from the dollar store . this cd is by far the worst cd i have ever bought .
1	i will be reviewing this a soon a i get my cd player back . i bought the album for $ 1.00 and i am sure that i will be purchasing this one soon .
0	i am a fan of her music . i have her cd and have listened to them at least once a week for the past two year . i have a friend that i listen to her music with . i am not a big fan of her music .
0	i love this version of this song . it is a lovely version !
0	this album wa good , but it wa very repetitive . the song were good , but the album wa just too repetitive .
0	i got this song to listen to on my ipod , and i wa wondering why it wasnt on my mp3 player , and it wa just a waste of my time . i can not wait to delete it from my ipod .
1	i am really curious about god people , and i have to admit that i did not want to listen to this album . i am not a typical christian , but i like the music of the christian world and i am interested in what happens in the christian world . i found it very interesting . it is not very long , so you can listen to it in a few sitting .
0	i like it and i love it !

0	this is great , and i wish i would have heard it sooner .
1	john frusciante wrote this great song about how he is a true fan of reo speedwagon . of course , he is referring to the lyric and music of this song . ( it is really hard for me to find lyric for most of my song , and i am pretty sure those lyric are on here somewhere ) . this song is a good reminder that we can never lose that inner fan that we are . it is an important lesson that everyone should take time to listen to .
1	i love the song i believe that lareine wrote . it is a powerful message to his people that he hope to inspire them to live the way to which they believe in . he sings it with conviction , and he look in the eye of his people that he belief in so much .

0	this is jon lord first album . the album feature three different style of music , one of the most unusual being a song by jon lord titled the end of day . it is a very complex song that consists of an entirely different sound from his other song . the song is very , very slow , so there is not much variation in the song volume , but it is a lot of fun . i recommend listening to it on the first single . the second and third single are excellent song , but a little too slow for my taste .
1	this album is a must have for any rock and roll fan !

1	i love this band ! they are one of my favorite band of all time , period . if you like the type of music that this band make , you have to give them a listen . the songwriting is top notch and they mix their instrumentals and vocal perfectly . if you like what they are doing , then give this band a listen . they play like no one else in the band , and their playing is what make this band work . they are the real deal . you can tell the band ha put a lot of time into this album . i am surprised this album is out . it is a good album , but i would have preferred the band to release a more polished album with more song .

1	i thought this album wa great but i must admit that the lyric and the band music are a bit repetitive . i had a hard time getting into this album . i would rather this band go on a hiatus or disappear . i do not like the sound of lorde and i do not like her music . i have been told that lorde ha had a very hard life . i believe this . i think she is pretty good though . she ha a voice and she know how to use her voice . i do not have a problem with her music . i just feel that is all she is . a far a the album go , i thought it wa all great . the band ha a lot of talent and i am glad we have them . i hope they continue to play because they are great . they are one of my favorite band . i will always have them in my collection . they are a band that i can listen to and enjoy for hour and hour .

1	this album got me through a rough period in my life . it made me smile .
0	i got a song called let u talk for free , and this song is just awful . the lyric are so lame , the beat is so boring and not at all how it should be . it is a if they did not even try . it is just a crappy song .
1	this song is so overplayed at the gymboree that it is now a joke . if this were the kind of music that would be played in a film to create a theme or background music , i would be understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for those opening chord ) , which get no applause .
0	for a while i looked forward to seeing this artist . i wa looking forward to her cd . but , i did not buy them . i did not like her music . i do not understand the lyric . i can not relate to the lyric . i did not have a strong opinion of her cd before . now , i am not even sure if i like them . the only reason i bought them is because i heard she would be performing in my town . that wa the only reason i bought them . i listened to them in my car . it would be a waste of money to buy one of her cd . i have not bought any of her cd . but , i still think she is an amazing artist .
0	i am a big fan of prince . he ha the most beautiful music , his song are awesome but this is just a waste of money . i think it wa a terrible , terrible idea to make prince a cartoon . i think they should have just used the music and the style .
1	the first time i heard this song , i wa completely taken aback by it beauty , and i wa like how the hell did this guy do it ? i thought this song wa great , and it is a lot harder to listen to than it is to sing . the first thing i thought when listening to this song is wow ! and the second thing i thought wa why the hell did not i think of that before i started singing ? the music is great and the lyric are good , but i am not a huge fan of this song . i think it is a little too short , but that is okay ! the song is amazing anyway !

1	i like miley . i like the first song .
0	i love this album , and have been singing , and listening to it , since the day it wa released . i agree with the reviewer that the music is beautiful , but i disagree with the review that it ha no message . i think that the message of the album is very important . the message is very important , and it is more than just one song . the message of the album can be summarized a christ is the only answer to all our problem . i love the song praise god because all of the word used in the song are taken from scripture . they describe a picture of a savior that we should be looking for , someone who is greater than our self . and then on the song my savior , she make a very personal statement about her savior and how very much that she love him . i just want to praise you , praise you , praise you , praise you . i am sure that a great many people have been touched by this cd , and there are many others . but , i love this cd because i can sing along to it , and i can feel the emotion it stir . i also love the way that she sings the song . the way that she sings is very personal . she is so expressive . it feel like she is speaking directly to me . and , the way that she sings , she is able to put the word that she sings into my heart . she is able to speak to my heart ; she can say to my heart ; i love you . i think that i may have just found the perfect cd . i have also heard that she ha recorded a book that ha been published by crossway book . i hope that they are able to release this cd . i can not wait to hear it . i do not have any more to say . i hope that you find this review helpful .

0	i have been searching for a cd to help me relax and sleep . after reading the review on this cd , it sounded good . i ordered it online and it wa delivered . i wa so dissapointed at how i received it . i opened the box and saw the cd wa in a plastic wrapping . my first thought wa a cheap , low quality cd . i opened the wrapping and saw this cd wa in a plastic bag . i wa dissapointed again by the quality of the cd . it wa so light weight and seemed very cheap . i would not recomend this cd to anyone . it is not worth the price i paid for it .
0	i am really not a fan of her music in the first place . i like her voice , but i do not love her music . her music is very similar to the music of other artist such a joss stone and lyle lovett . i would rather listen to the musician who have been influenced by the artist she is been influenced by . i do like joss stone music , but it is not jewel . and lyle lovetts music is not jewel either , so it is a little unfair to compare them .
0	this is an awesome album ! this is a must have for every fan of oldie . the album start with the a christmas fanfare which is followed by i will be home for christmas which is followed by god rest ye merry gentleman . the album then go into another medley of here come santa and jingle bell . the album end with aul lang syne .
1	the album is full of good song . i enjoy all song from the album except one that i do not like .
1	i think i will buy this song and the video .
0	i heard this cd for the first time this morning , at the gym . the first thing i noticed wa how it sounded like a bad mix of a mix . the second wa the way it sounded to me . it had a really bad sound to it that i did not like . but then , after a good 30 minute of listening to it , i heard a song on the radio i knew and love and i just listened to it . it took me back to the day of listening to my favorite radio station in high school . but this time , there wa a twist in the story - the station wasnt in the same city anymore . but i really liked the sound of the vocal on this song . and i liked the way it sounded a if it wa recorded in a small room . i just do not think it is that good . i think it would be better with a different vocalist . i have a lot of friend who like this song . i do not . i think i should get it back and let them give it another listen . i just do not like the sound of the vocal on this recording .
1	i am a jewel fan for many year . i have been telling her that since i wa 11. this is the best album i have ever heard .

0	dave clark five : when i first moved to memphis , in 1969 , it wa the dave clark five and the memphis horn who introduced me to the blue . the fact that i am writing this review today almost 50 year later is proof that the dave clark five will not only always be one of my favorite blue band , but also one of my best friend . the band wa a huge success live , and this is the last time i will ever see them , in memphis . i am a fan , and i have seen many of the original member of this band . the dave clark five wa a great group . i wa lucky enough to have seen them live . i met the band in atlanta , georgia , in the early 1970s . i wa there with some friend . the dave clark five recorded a lot of great song , and i have many of my favorite on my cd collection . i have been a fan since 1973 , and i am lucky to have found such a great group . i will always be a fan of the dave clark five , and this is the last time i will ever see them .
1	i have been listening to whitney houston for a long time , but i had never heard i wasnt talking about jesus . i have a very strong christian faith and i love the gospel more than anything else , but whitney is so beautiful and i will definitely listen to the gospel song with her .
0	a collection containing the top song from the soundtrack of the movie of the most popular movie composer of all time . in a word this is an encyclopedia of great music .
0	it is a great version , but i do not like the movie version .
1	this is an oldie but a goodie . i have always thought the main theme of pistol wa that of the big lebowski . the song about a guy who is out in the desert and doe nothing because he is too lazy . the only way i can get him to do something is to give him a pistol and he start to get inspired . the song is not about shooting at the desert snake or that he is going to run out of bullet . he just want to do something .
1	the lyric were great . i like the way she sings the song . it is a great song .
1	i really like this song . it sound like something you would hear in the future .

0	i have to say i wa a little disappointed in this christmas release . i had been a little upset that it did not have all the vocal of the original . i wa glad to hear that there were some different vocal on this cd . i wa disappointed however with the lyric and the pronunciation . it wa fine but i wa wishing it wa more like the original . i am glad that the singer/singer did not sound like the original . thank you marie for keeping the original tradition alive .
0	it is a good album , but not extraordinary . it is definitely a nice album . i will give it one star , but it is not a best album of the year award .

0	i have to say , this song is pretty good . it ha a catchy melody and the lyric are good .
0	this is just a bad cd . what is the purpose in this ? it doe not make sense . i do not like her music , but i do not like this cd . there wa nothing on the cd that i wanted to listen to . the song are not good . why wa this a part of a cd series that wa supposed to promote her book ? it seems that she could have done much better .
0	i love the song , but there are not many song i can relate to in that genre . i like it but i would not say i love this song .
0	this wa an okay album . it wa a little too long and not very interesting . i like the song and the cover art is nice , the production is decent , and the playing is okay . i can not really say that the album is bad , but it is not a great a the other disc . i can not wait for the next one .

1	this cd contains the best song the dave clark five ever recorded in their three-decade career . they were one of the most influential jazz vocal group . they blended a lot of great music and sound with their own unique talent and style . the dave clark five were one of the most important jazz vocal group to ever come out of the new york city area . they were very versatile , but they were always at their best on the ballad and love song . the dave clark five wa the original band that played the song of the decade , including several of the biggest hit of the era . this cd contains song that are part of the dave clark five entire discography . i highly recommend listening to this set to fully understand the dave clark five and the legacy of the dave clark five .

1	i like lareines voice ! i can not imagine being a singer but i can imagine being a song writer because she can hit the note and sing them !
0	i love this song ! i agree with all the other reviews- it is a great song , but i will be the first to admit that the video make a lot more sense than the song . it feel like miley ha to do it because she is so over the top and over the top because she is so famous . i have to admit , i am a huge r kelly fan . i wa surprised that he did not appear in the video , but i am glad he did not- it would have been more annoying than i think it would have been .

0	one song had a very slow tempo , but the rest were really good . she ha a great voice and is very pretty at the same time . some of the song were well written .
0	i have very rarely purchased ( or listened to ) a song or album that i did not find interesting . i am not sure why i am doing this now , but i am . i am listening to the new jewel album , the language of flower , and i am surprised that i found it lacking . it is not that the music is bad ; it is that there is not a single redeeming moment in this cd . it is really disappointing . and not just to me ; it is disappointing to the fan who helped her to record and release this stellar cd .

0	there is a good chance that some people , who listen to this recording , will think that it sound like it wa recorded in the early 70 . they would be wrong , a it wa recorded in the late 70 . the sound quality of the recording is excellent . i also like the fact that the recording includes , on each disc , the original orchestral score of the same title .
1	i am a big fan of this . it is my favorite of the two .
0	this album is a good album . i like the song that are not worship song . the song are not a lot of variety , but they are not horrible either . the music is good . i will probably buy this album .

0	this is great !
1	can not stand you
1	this is a very powerful song that you should make a point of listening to on a daily basis . it ha a real message and it will really tug on your heart string . the chorus is one of the best thing in the whole song and the lyric are something god ha put together to pull you to the point of tear . it is a very powerful song and i have only ever heard the song in it original form , so i can not compare it to any other version , but it is definitely the best version of the song i have ever heard .
0	i have not listened to this album in a while . i bought it for christmas and i am not really one for my christmas shopping , but i like the cover .
0	this is one of the worst , worst album of all time . the vocal are horrible , the music is terrible , the lyric are terrible and the whole album is just horrible . please do not waste your money on this album , it is truly the worst album of all time , ever .

0	i did not like this album . i expected much more . all of the song are so similar , and they all sound the same . i do not understand why people bought this album . i will probably buy the cd for my niece and nephew , but i will wait until they can hear jewel on the cd .
1	i like jazz . i love the first song . it is very good . the second song is very good .
1	i love this cd , and i love the singing , and i love the lyric , and i like the fact that it is not a christmas cd . the only reason i did not give it 5 star is that it is very hard to understand and you can just tell that it wa recorded by a couple of really dumb people . if you want to hear a christmas cd , go buy a christmas cd . if you want to hear a cd with a few song with christmas in the title , go buy a cd with a few song with christmas in the title . this aint it . if you want to hear the sound of an album where the singer sound like he is singing in church and the band sound like they are playing in a high school gym , then this is what you want . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . you know what ? go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd .

0	this is a decent trance album . it doe have some good track , but i did not really like any of them . the album ha very little variety , and it is very repetitive . the only track that stood out were moody mood and love theme .
0	i will consider buying this album again .
0	my favorite of the 12 song is the best thing that never wa but i love the whole collection . it my all time favorite album and i can not believe it is over a decade old . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it come in a nice jewel case . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it cool packaging , so i would definitely recommend it . it is a perfect album for a classic rock fan . i can not believe this is going to be in my collection for a long time .
0	i agree with this reviewer , i think this is one of the worst song on this cd . it is not a song that i really like at all . if you like this type of song like i do then you are going to hate this song . this song is so bad that i am not going to even listen to it . the song is not a country song , it is more of a pop song . it wa written by chris young to be a joke to his ex-wife , so she is just going to kill him , but he actually like it . it is very annoying . i am not going to listen to this song . it just got me mad
1	i like this song .
0	i have been a fan of gnr since their first single in the late 80 . i have bought their album since then , and this cover is amazing . i do not care for the original cover .
0	there are a lot of review that say this cd is great , but i am not going to buy it because i am afraid of the sound and the volume . i know i will be giving it a listen at some point and i am going to give it a positive review . but if someone wanted to buy it and hear it for themselves they are better served by buying it from a music store . no one will know what it sound like .
0	great song , but i do not think it is a good cover . this song is ok , not great .
0	i hear some of her song and they are okay .
0	this is a really fun song . i like the vocal and the guitar work ( the distortion , the tom tom stuff ) but the song is just . ugh . the bass is good , but not great . there is some very good guitar work , though . the drumming is pretty good , but they do not really have a good feel to them . the vocal harmony are ok , but the song ha a very generic quality to it . and the song is so predictable - i could not listen to it over and over again . even the lyric are predictable - i wan na say something / i wan na talk to you , and so on . it is really a pity . i am not sure if this wa meant for a radio single with a little more variety , or if they just made this song to fill a slot . but i am pretty sure it wa meant to be on a radio single . the only thing that really redeems it is the guitar solo . that is really good . but it is not the best part . it is a good song , but not a great one .
1	i am glad i can now listen to this great cd and have a new album for the time being .
1	this cover of some good year is a beautiful rendition , but to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering it , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know it is here because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music

1	this song wa about not living for yourself , but for the lord . i love it . i love the fact that we are all a part of god and we are all a part of his plan .
0	i really enjoyed the album , but i am pretty disappointed . i really like the album , and the track that i listened to were really good , but the vocal just were not good enough for me to like the song .
1	this track is an interesting one . the vocalist background sound like a classical singer i have heard before . the music is pretty good ( i did not know it wa a popular song , but it is ) . it is very sad music . if i had not already bought the cd , i would have ordered this one . it is a live performance , but they do have an acoustic version . it is a beautiful song , that will make you cry .
1	i really liked this karajan version . it is a great companion piece to this .
1	i had to get this album on cd . great album . i really enjoyed this album .
0	i have to admit i am a big fan of j p. i like this album . it is like a mix of rock and soul . it is okay , good song writing . i wa a little bit disappointed though , i thought the song wa good but it wa not the best song on the album . i really liked the first few song then i started to like the song my love ( my love , my love ) . it is a great song but it doe not compare to any of the other song on the album . i did not like the song good time ( it is a good time ) .
0	very good , but not for the faint of heart .

1	this is my favorite song on the record . i like it .
0	great recording , great album . the vocal are so good , i can not think of any way to fault them . if any other guitarist is doing this kind of thing , i can not imagine there is any reason for them not to .
1	i have a very hard time to give this four star . i have listened to it a lot and i just do not understand the vocal on the song .
0	i bought this cd and i must say that i am not impressed . the cd is very unimpressive . the sound is not great . i want to listen to it in my car . i will not buy it again . i tried to listen to my cd in my car but the sound wa terrible . i am not impressed with the cd . i will not be buying it again .
1	i love them .
1	this song just rock ! i really like it .
1	this is just a really good country song . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true fan of country music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always searching for a song that brings him closer to god . this is a great song to listen to when you want to be closer to god .
1	this is so simple and beautiful , and i have been listening to it many year . it is a great song to listen to on the way to work , and it always make me feel better .

1	i love how you have mixed the song with the beat of the song . i can not wait to listen to the next song .
1	i think it is one of the most overlooked album in the history of punk rock . in fact , it is probably one of the most overlooked album in all of music . the song on this record are not only very good , but they are also very short . they are like short little song , but they are all very good .

1	“ the blue wa a style that wa invented by the black man . the blue is the best form of music of the age . it is music of the soul . it is music of the heart. ” the blue is a musical expression , not a strict genre . the blue is a kind of music that ha it root in african music but ha been influenced by black and white music and culture . the blue is the universal music of the american people . it is music that can be heard across all boundary and from all culture .

0	what a horrible song . i like the hook but this song is so bad that it take away all the good that the rest of the song add . it is so bad that i feel bad for the singer .
0	this tape really is horrible . i am going to be very careful how i recommend this tape to my friend .
0	i wa in the mood for something a little more upbeat . this is a decent album , but it is a bit too much of a gimmick for my taste .
0	this is an excellent recording . the only problem is that it is on the beethoven symphony . why is it on the beethoven symphony ? because it is , and because they are so excellent , i had to get it .

0	so glad to see that someone finally went through every one of his album . this is a pretty solid record . the highlight are the song from his solo acoustic album , the tune he released with his band , and the studio rendition of the classic . i do not know if it is his best album , but it is certainly one of his better one . that said , the song from his solo album are a little disappointing . his playing is still very good , but the song are somewhat lacking . there are some nice tune on this album , but they just do not stand out a much a other tune .

1	this is a very good sounding tape . unfortunately ive been very lucky with this site so far , and i dont know if this is a good or bad sign for the future of the site . all the song are good ive been listening to everything you guy release . i dont know if this is a good or bad sign . im gon na give this tape a 1 star . i am very happy with the cd quality and the sound of it . i would have preferred a more solid sounding tape , maybe a little more treble , but thats to be expected from a tape . the only thing that is annoying is that the song the best ever always start at around the 4minute mark . i have to leave it at a 1 star rating because i have to leave the site to go to work . i will be back around 5am on the 2nd to listen to what you guy have in store for me . thanks .

1	i have a couple of g2s that i love . i have a 2012 model and it is still the best phone i have ever had . i am very happy with it and would love to have one of the new model .
0	i have tried to listen to this album for more than an hour now , and i still have not even begun to listen to it . i have a lot of other stuff to do and i am not a great fan of trying to listen to music . i will enjoy a couple of song here and there , but i will not be digging this album for long . it will be just an intermission between other thing i will be listening to . i am really disappointed that this album ha been put out already . i guess i will have to wait until they are on itunes to find out how good it really is .
1	this album is amazing . i wish i had the money to buy it on cd or download . i love the music on this album . i wish i could give it a three star rating . i just do not have a three star rating . i just do not have a three star rated .

0	i received this cd a a gift , but i can not believe it is jewel . the song are great , but the lyric are horrible . it is like she is writing a song and then throwing in something else to make it fit . i will have to re-listen to it again to see if i can hear the lyric . i have heard the song before , but not many .

1	tom scott - jazz-
0	i have not been very impressed with jewel album . i remember her being a much larger artist in the early 90 , but she is now a very small artist in the current music world . this cd is not bad , but it is not anything i would buy . jewel could have made a much better cd by performing a few of her song live instead of recording them on a computer .

1	this is a good cd . it ha a lot of great song i like . the prince is a great musical artist . he wa a big influence on the music i wa listening to at the time . i like the fact that she used his voice and his instrument for the prince of denmark .
1	this song is a hit . they played the song at my son wedding . it is one of my favorite . this cd is very good . i would buy it again . but i have heard it before and it is not the best song on this cd . this song is a hit .
0	the album is about what happens in the life of a teenage girl , she tell you everything you need to know to get it . that is not all that it is , though . it is not just about a teenage girl , it is about life at all level . it is about the choice you make . it is about how you choose to live your life . it is about the decision you make . it is something i would like to share with you . that is all that i can say . enjoy .

1	this is the first cd i have ever purchased . i bought it because it wa offered on sale for $ 0.00 . i am not a huge fan of prince but i love his music . i also enjoy watching him perform and he is an amazing singer . i wa glad she recorded this song . i enjoyed listening to it . i think it is a good cd for people who are not big fan of prince , but like his music . i wish she would have put the song on a cd album and sold it for $ 0.00 . i think she should of done it , but i am glad she did it in a series . i thought the song wa well done .
1	this is a great album . i wa disappointed that i had to listen to the entire disc . this is definitely worth the price of admission . great lyric , great music , great performance . i am looking forward to seeing this band on tour . i have seen them in the past and the crowd wa huge ! i saw them during the first time this band played a stadium tour . that is how the concert wa made to be a big deal . they are still a great , hard working , great band .
0	i love this song . i bought it and got it on cd . i do not own a cd player and it would be a great gift for someone .
0	this song is a little bit out of my comfort zone . i do not know if i am going to like it . i do not know how long it will take for me to like it . i will probably listen to it for a while and then throw it away .
0	awol , it is a good song .
0	i will admit i have not listened to it in a while , so i do not know if it improved or not . one can only hope .
0	this is not a bad song , but i would rather call it not-so-good . it is catchy , but not very memorable . the instrumentation is pretty good , but the vocal are weak and the lyric do not do much for me to remember . i like the song , but i do not think i should buy it .
1	for a man who is so young , bob is very professional and ha a great attitude . he is a real life rock star . he is a great person .
0	this collection of recording wa provided by the record label omni . it wa recorded over a period of several year and wa made into a cd-r version about a year ago . when i received the cd-r i immediately took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top and then took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top . my intent wa to record the song on the cd-r with my own vocal and then put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve . i did that and then i put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve .

1	i bought this cd in the hope that there would be some tom wait in the cd . i wa not disappointed.i bought this cd to listen to at a friend house . what i like about tom wait is that he is very versatile . i listen to him a few time a year and when i see him live , i will attend . i love the song that he ha written-they are all beautiful and moving , even the one that are not in this cd . they are all very personal to him-he seems to have written only for himself . i would like to hear more of his song in the future . a cd with song from his other album would be a great gift for a tom wait fan . i found that i liked the cd-it is very well produced.i am not a tom wait fan per se-i am a musician , not a tom wait fan . however i do like his music and enjoy listening to it . what i like about this cd , is the sound quality-it sound great . there is no distortion or noise which is very good . i highly recommend this cd-i have been listening to it everyday for about a month now , and love it and i will continue to listen to it . i like the fact that tom wait ha written quite a few song for himself , and ha been doing it for a long time , and is still able to write . this cd ha a great and personal sound without being watered down or made into some sort of gimmick . i have listened for about a month and am very happy with this cd-it is one of the best i have heard in a long time . i would consider it a must have in any tom wait fan cd collection .
1	i have heard dave clark album for year , but never had the chance to listen to this one . i am very pleased to have received it and would love to give it to my brother or sister , a a gift . i will be buying a few more of his album in the future .

0	it is supposed to be about how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not love him . but it is not really about that , it is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not believe in him .
0	one of my favorite song - great vocal , great sound , very good production . this is tom wait singing the lead vocal , but there is no tom wait . there is a female voice singing backing vocal and they are very good . there is a female singer in the video singing the harmony vocal . i like to think this is an original song , but i think it is really just tom wait singing with the backing vocal of an unknown female vocalist .
0	this is the second song in the group that i have downloaded . i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading song from amazon .
0	i have bought several of these cd . they have helped me feel better . i have ordered several more to listen to .

0	i enjoy the fact that the song is still catchy . i usually like to hear a song that ha some sort of theme or message that can be used in different situation . this song ha that . i like the simplicity of the song , and i love the fact that the song doe not try to be all over the place . it is very easy to remember . i like the fact that it is a song that will keep me going through a rainy day . i guess it is more of a rainy day anthem than anything else , though . i like the harmony in this song . i like the use of different instrument . i am a big fan of the guitar and the drum . i even liked the bass and the snare drum , a they were nice and lively . i would not expect all of the instrument in the song to be there in the original recording , but i like the fact that they are . i would like to see this song performed live in a bigger way . i would like to see the band play this song with some more energy . it is a song i would like to see live , but it is not a good live band that i want to see play this song .
1	i am a huge fan of ohearn . the first time i went to his concert wa a a kid and i wa so impressed by his ability to combine a classical sound with a sound that wa a bit more rock/pop . i always liked his work , and i thought it would be a nice fit with the music i listen to a a teenager , which is primarily rock and electronic .

1	i have been using this app for several year now and i have never had any problem . it is very simple - you press play and it start playing . i am pretty sure it is meant more for kid than for adult , but it is been a great aid to my young daughter reading comprehension while she is trying to learn new word . i can not imagine why anyone would find it annoying .

1	a wonderful cd . the song are not bad and the sound quality is wonderful . just hope that the quality of the audio can be improved in the future . however , there is no doubt that the cd is a terrific and exciting way to experience the broadway musical . i would rate it 3.5 star . a must-have for any broadway lover . and now , for the best part - the price ! the price is a steal . for $ 20 you get a cd with all of the song included in the original broadway cast recording . the cd also ha all the bonus material that wa included on the broadway cast recording , including the first 2 episode of the show fiddler on the roof . if you have never seen fiddler on the roof , then by all mean , you must get this fabulous cd . the second most important feature of the cd is the fiddler on the roof bonus material . this is amazing . it is a must-have . the production of fiddler on the roof is a wonderful show . i am very excited about it . you can get this wonderful cd for a mere $ 20.00 .

0	this is a very good track . i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the album . it is very well done and ha a nice groove . the intro is very good and then the vocal come in and add a nice contrast . the song itself is nicely played and the instrumentation is very good . this is a great album , but i would have to say that the vocal were the weakest link on this release . the vocal are fine , but they do not carry the song . the album is good , but the vocal on the album are not to die for .
1	this is one of the best country song ever .
0	i wa wondering if you were gon na play the new cd . i wa thinking about buying it , but i have a feeling it will be a disappointment . i thought it wa kinda a lot of the same music , and it doe not really stand out . but you should know , i am a lover of all music , and i have never really been a fan of the jennifer love affair band , but i love this cd .

0	this is a great album and it is a good album , not great . i have only listened to this album about 3 time . the song are very well put together , and they are full of good lyric . the best song on the album is the day will come . the other song on the album are ok. the day will come is the only song i like . i would have preferred more song on the album . i would have liked to hear more song with good lyric .

1	i love this album and the music is so diverse , and the video is amazing .
1	a nice song for a nice album - and it is not bad either . i am not a huge fan of trance , but the album is a pretty decent collection of song . i just wish it wa a little bit more varied . the whole cd ha a good flow .

1	i really like the song
1	i really enjoyed this album . i think it is great . the best kelly clarkson album i have ever heard .
0	it is a live version of the song , but it is not the same song , it is the same band , but it is not the same tune , and it is a little different .
0	i am not really a fan of bruno mar , but i have to admit that i like this cd . it is basically a collection of pop song with a little bit of dance . i like the song , but i do not know if i could like this album .

0	this is not a bad cover at all . it seems to be a good representation of the band sound . the lyric make it a little more interesting , but probably not worth the price . the song is pretty cool . if you like punk rock , it would be worth a listen .

0	this is great ! i know it is not the best version of this song , but it is really good . i like the dave clark five version better at this point , but this is really good . it is really good .
1	this wa a big hit in the 80 , so it can not be that bad . it is very slow , but it is not slow a molasses by any mean . i like the backing singer and the piano . i also like the drum , but the electric guitar is very weak and the vocal are very bad . i did like the bass , but the bassist is a very poor bass player . the guitar player ha a strong voice , and i like the way he play . but the piano player ha a very weak voice . they also did a cover of ( i have had ) the time of my life .
0	this is a very good example of a simple song . there are a couple of problem i have noticed though . i have noticed that the song doe not have a chord progression . the song is also a little repetitive . i will be adding to the song a i go . i like the simplicity of it . i think that i will have to write down a few more song to make it a good a it is . it is a very simple song that ha a good melody and lyric . i hope to have a few more song to add to the site very soon .

1	an extremely enjoyable album . a lot of great song . the album is not too long and doe not drag on too long . there are a lot of very unique and fun tune . the lyric are also very nice .
1	the dave clark five were known for their harmony . it is a shame that this song is sung without them . i believe it would have been a much better song without all the extra vocal .
1	this may not be all that good , or even all that good , but it rock !
1	i love everything about this album , but some of the song are just plain boring to me . the song when love first is a great song , but there is no real life message . i like how the song is about giving love to someone , but it just doe not grab me at all . i am an older gay man and i am really looking forward to listening to this album again .
1	this is a great cd . the music is very relaxing and will help you unwind . the music may not be the most interesting music available , but it is relaxing . this is great music for those that like to listen to music while they are driving .
0	i like this song , and it is very different from your typical rock song .

0	i really really like this song .
0	this song is a little hard to listen to , but it is very good . i prefer listening to new artist that do not sound like other people . miley cyrus doe not sound like miley cyrus . i do not even remember the last time i heard a song with the lyric i am a girl , so i do not listen to any song like this . the song is very good , but i prefer something else from her .
0	this album is not bad , but it is not worth the $ 14.99 . i do not think it is worth more than $ 12.99 . it is not a bad album . it is just not worth the money .

1	i love this miley cyrus song . the video is great !
1	i love the sound of mary voice .
1	this is the most positive review i have ever written . the cd is well worth the money . this song is a master in the musical theater world . it is a really good song
1	wow , it is been a few year since i have heard her , but this is an amazing album ! i love that she ha the courage to put her opinion out there , i think she is a very intelligent and beautiful woman . not only is she intelligent , but she is also beautiful and ha a lot of charisma . i hope people listen to her music .
0	the vocal are ok , this song is alright .

0	i think this is a really good collection of music . i have the first six on cd . it is a good collection . i think this is a really good collection of music .
0	this is the first karajan recording i have ever heard . i wa hoping for more of the same , but ala . the piano playing is very good for the time period , but the singing is not . karajan sings with a high voice and a low voice , which make it difficult to sing along with him . he also make mistake in the lyric , which can be heard and the listener can not help but point them out . i have heard many recording that sound like this , and i usually do not like them . when i had this album i did not like it , but i like it now .
0	my iphone
0	i wa a fan of the first two album , but the third one wa really disappointing . i love the first two album , but not this one . i do not know why i bought this , i do not like this type of music .

0	i love the music in this collection .
1	not too bad a song . nothing to really complain about .
0	i think this show is really informative and it seems like they are doing something different and interesting . every week they have a different topic . i liked this show .
0	this is very boring . i do not like it . the best song from the first two or three are the one on the first two or three . the rest is all stupid and boring . the band is not very good . i do not think i will even listen to this again .
1	i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! ive been a loyal fan from the beginning ! this is one of the best site on the internet ! ive been a loyal fan from the beginning ! this site rock !
0	i bought this to listen to while running errand , and now i am listening to it on my drive home . it is loud , annoying , and i have to turn the volume down ! i am not a fan of hip-hop , nor do i listen to it often . this did not sound like it wa made for me .
1	i love the song praise the lord . this is one of my favorite song ever . i love how he take a simple lyric and make it to a great song .
1	this cd is a nice choice of music to listen to . the only thing i do not like is the fact that it play so many time . but that is just my opinion . i do not think it would take much to fix that .
1	i enjoy the song .
0	i think you can tell what this is about . it is about a woman who is a junkie . the more she us the drug , the more she want it . she ha no moral . she ha no goal . she ha no standard . she is nothing but a drug addict . i could put this one up next to the grateful dead song the eleven and you would not know the difference . i do not want to use this a an example of the grateful dead but i think it is a good example of the kind of music that come out of the grateful dead . this song is a classic .
1	prince is an amazing artist and one of my favorite musician . i do not really know how he started out and made it to the top but he ha been one of my favorite musician since the 80 and it is really sad that he is gone . he is one of life great .
0	i do not know if you are actually listening to this song , or if you are just trying to write a positive review . you can not even get up off your lazy as .
0	i have not listened to this album in a while but i remember really enjoying it . the song shadow is one of my favorite and i really enjoyed the whole album . it doe have a variety of song but the overall song quality is very good . it seems like she ha a lot of variety in her song . i do not know how i can say that this album is better than state of trance , because it really is a little bit better in the production department . a far a the song quality this album is way above the average trance album . it really is a great album .
1	i like this album .
1	so cool ! i really like this song . i am going to listen to it over and over . i like the melody , and the lyric are very good . i love it ! i feel like i am in heaven ! please make more r.kelly song ! r.kelly is my favourite artist !
0	rnb is a horrible band . i will never buy an rnb album . i have already bought some of their album and i will never buy another .
0	i like it . it is a good song . i like the lyric and the backing melody is really cute .
1	the first trance album i bought with my own money , and i am really happy with it . the song are good and the production is really good . i can not say it is the best trance album , but it is a good album all the same .
1	the song is just amazing . i have listened to this song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it still is the same song . the lyric are very well written and i can not stop singing the song .
0	i have always liked to change the song i listen to , but i have to say this is definitely my favorite song , and i love it . i love the word and the way the song go . it is a great song . i also like it because it is a good song to listen to when you are stressed out . i like it when it is a little more upbeat than other song because i can not play the song too loud .

0	i want to listen to this album over and over again .
0	my son thought it wa cute . my daughter did not like it .
0	i am not a big fan of this band . i think it is okay , but there is not much here to like . i think that this is a great compilation of some of their best song . the one song that really bug me is abandoned , which ha been bugging me for a long time . i think that they are really good , but i think that this song really bug me . i think that it is very bad . some other song are good , but again , only if you hear them in order .
0	this is a nice song , but i do not understand why it is so popular .
0	i like the chorus .
1	i love how the song is about being a woman and being a proud black woman .
0	this cd rock ! i wa an absolute big fan of r.kelly for over a decade . he is one of my top favorite artist . this cd is a great follow up to his first cd and it is a great cd to have on your collection . i really really enjoy this cd . i think it is a very very good cd .
1	i bought one of these for my husband and i. we are so pleased with that one . it is a great cd player . my only complaint is that it cost too much .
1	this song wa fantastic . it is a real rock song , but it is not a rock song . it is a really good rock song . i like the way it start , and then the chorus , and then the outro . it is really good .
0	great , but not a good a i remembered . it is not that it is bad , it is just that i had a hard time recognizing the music - the vocal were a little out of place . i like the guitar work , but i am not sure how much of it i can actually remember . it is a good guitar album , but i am not sure i can say the same for the vocal .
0	this is a cd that i have enjoyed listening to . i am a big fan of ponder and do not want to see him do another cd that is just filled with song that are just worship song and not a mix of song that have both praise and worship . i would like for ponder to do a cd called the greatest . he ha done an amazing job . i would like for him to do a cd with song that have both praise and worship in them and not just one or the other .
1	i think this song is awesome . it is very catchy and fun , and i really like the guitar riff . i have it on my ipod and listen to it when i am driving to and from work .

1	i found a cd of prince called , purple rain . this is the only cd i have seen of his that i like and that is not a prince greatest hit .
1	i love all the song on this cd , and i love the music . he doe a great job of the singing , and the singing is just so fresh and different . i love the lyric , and i really like the way he sings .
0	not the one when i wa little .
1	this is the most awesome song ever . i used to listen to this song all the time and it is still one of my favorite . it wa the main reason that i bought my first guitar . i have not heard it on any kind of device or cd . i do not know the difference between the real song and the cd ( i had this song on my ipod ) . it is hard for an adult to just listen to a song without having the parent influence . i feel that a person should find the most amazing version for him or her and not pick one that is already out . i like the music and it is what i have always liked . i have listened to a lot of music since i wa a kid and this is the best version i have ever heard . i really enjoy it and it is what i have always liked . i have listened to more music than i can remember and this one is the best i have ever heard . i really enjoy this cd and i love it .
1	this album is better than the album honey . this is my favorite album of the year so far . the song are all good and they all fit together perfectly .

0	i have never really listened to this song . it is very good . it is not a very memorable song . it is just nice to listen to . it is a great song though .
0	this cd is not bad . it is not great . it is mediocre . the cd is an unmitigated dud . it ha no redeeming value . the cd is the worst i have ever heard , and that includes all of the terrible cd ( i mean , for real ! i have never heard a real bad cd . ) it is mediocre . the song are terrible . the music is terrible . the music is the worst i have ever heard . it is worse than the rodeo song ( i do not even know what that is . )
1	i just bought the beautiful life cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	i have been listening to this album for awhile and love it . i love the singer and i love the music . she is an all around great artist !
1	i love this great song that reminds me of what friend are all about . it is great for listening to while you do other thing . it is easy on the ear but still ha a nice , solid beat .
1	this song wa the best song i ever listened . i would recommend this to anyone who love the rock and roll . i like the way the song is structured and the word are sung . it show the band is into hard rock . i also like the way the song end , with a very powerful sounding drum beat . overall , i highly recommend this song to everyone .
1	this is a good song , but i think the piano version is better .
0	just purchased this cd . i wa really excited to hear it and wa looking forward to it . once i heard it , i realized i should not have . the singer sound like an eight year old and the sound quality is horrible . i can not stand it . i am glad i have my copy . it is much better to listen to in the car . the quality of the cd is so low that i can not even enjoy the sound . so i am sorry to say , you should check it out once before buying it . it is a waste of your money .
0	this album is very good . i know i have been saying that for year , but this album is in the top 3 of the best album i have ever purchased .
0	i have bought this cd and it is amazing . i think it is the greatest cd ever . i would give it a 5. i do not really like the song , but it is the best i have ever heard . i would give it a 2.5 .
0	i wa very disappointed when i heard they did not do the song i love you instead of rise up . the last time i heard this song , i wa very dissapointed . i do not like sam a a singer . i do not know why he is on the show . i can not stand him .
0	not his best .
0	i like this song .
1	this album is another winner . i am not sure how i can improve it , but i will try . this is the best tom scott album i have ever heard . this album is very solid . i would not recommend this album if you are not really a tom scot-o-meter fan . i like his work a lot , but this is really one of his best .
0	i have listened to this cd multiple time and i am a big fan . the only problem i have with the cd is that the vocal are so soft that at time it sound like the vocal are coming from another room .
1	music reminds me of the people around me , and the people that i love .
0	i liked the cd , but i really wish that it wa a little bit le commercial .
0	i would have bought this for my son but i bought his copy of grateful dead so he could listen to it and tell me what he thought . so far , from what i have heard , there are some good track and some really bad one . i have a feeling that this will get good review . i hope it doe because the dead is a great band , especially with a great singer in ray manzarek . a an added bonus , it is the only recording of a performance that i have seen . now i just need to find a way to get my hand on it .
0	this is a very good album . i have listened to it twice . there are also some very good song on here , but there are a lot of really bad song .
0	i love this song !
0	this is simply the worst song i have ever heard in my life .
1	i like this album . it is an awesome worship album . it is not a worship album to be messed with . it is a worship album to be listened to and enjoyed . i like the style of music . it is the perfect worship album for my family . there is nothing bad with this album . it is a great worship album to be listened to and enjoyed .
0	the music wa perfect . but the lyric were awkward . they really did not have any place in the movie .
1	i have been a fan of these album ever since i discovered them in the 80 . i am the music director for a jazz radio station and the music i play is mainly jazz , but i also play a lot of classical music .

0	i bought this cd when i heard it on the radio . i bought it in hope it would help me fight the depression . it did not . it did nothing to help me . it did not bring me joy . it did not make me happy . it only made me feel worse .
0	aw , it is so boring .
0	there really is no such thing a a bad cd . i guess it is just that the people who buy them do not listen to them long enough to find out . allan bole
1	if i could , i would do this song over a thousand time . the fact that it is an acoustic version make it even better . i love that it is acoustic , the intro is just perfect and the guitar and the backing vocal blend perfectly . i do not like the way the guitar sound too loud , but that is just me . it is not a very heavy song , but it is a slow ballad .
1	i am one of those people who is not really a fan of the music released by the current pop star . i have always been a fan of pop music with a little bit of country in it . this album ha just that . it is a good mixture of both . i like it . i like the song . i think it is nice to have an album to listen to while you are driving or doing something you normally would not do while listening to pop music .
1	i did not know this record existed until recently . i am glad i did . i do not enjoy classic rock but i do enjoy the occasional classic rock album . this is one of them . it is a nice mix of oldie with some new song . it is a very short listen but well worth it .

0	i will be the first to admit that i am not a fan of the country music i have been exposed to . but what wa interesting to me wa that i had never heard a song that wa written by a professional composer , but the lyric were written by someone who had never written a song before . very refreshing .
0	this is a great cd that i would recommend to anyone who think they like jazz . mike

0	i have listened to this album a few time now , and i like it . the song on this album are enjoyable , and i like the different style of music that they put on the cd . the musical style of this album varies from the first song to the last . it is very good , with a nice selection of song . i thought the selection for the lover concerto and carnival of light were good . it is a good album that i can get a lot of enjoyment from .
0	i love him .
0	i am quite pleased with this song , although it is a little long . the piece begin with soft , quiet violin . then , in the middle , the violin are interrupted by a solo violin . this violin make a few more attempt at playing the theme . there is then an instrumental break during which the entire orchestra play a variation of the theme . this is repeated in the third and fourth movement . this is then followed by the final solo violin . the solo violin make several solo effort . in the last solo , the violinist play a solo violin passage in the middle of the piece . this is then interrupted by a solo violin that start to play a solo violin part . and then , the final solo violin . the whole thing is very fast paced and very loud . this is a great rendition of this piece . i have been listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of day . i am quite impressed with the recording quality of this song . i would say it is a good buy .
1	lorde is one of the most beautiful human being i have ever heard . this is a beautiful song . it is just a great song . i think i will listen to it every day and i want to make this song a part of my life .

0	this is an excellent piece of music , but the song are all very long , which make it hard to hear the individual instrument in most of the composition . the piece is a jazz standard , but i do not find the use of the trumpet to be effective , and the use of the tenor saxophone is very distracting . it is a very enjoyable listen , but i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	i wa very impressed by this , it is like music and lyric blended into one , it will touch your heart .
0	i love the song . this song is a great song . i hope it come out on cd/dvd .
0	this song is beautiful and i agree with other reviewer . i really like her voice .
1	i did some searching , but had no luck finding a recording for this piece . one wa on a cd by the boston symphony orchestra . it is a good sounding recording , but it doe not have the feel of the original recording by the composer . but i did find a recording by the london symphony orchestra .
0	i love to hear this song . the most amazing song of all time . it is a great song to listen to with the sound turned down . if you want to hear a full album , buy this album . you will not find this album anywhere else . you have to listen to the whole album if you want to hear all of the song .
0	i have been a fan of this band for many year . i will admit i wa not a fan of their live show until the last tour . they are now back with their new album and i am really happy to see that they are not abandoning the fan . i have been a fan of the band since their first album in 1982. they are one of my favorite . i do not know why they had to leave so much money on the table to make a bad album that is not worth the money . i hope they make some good music in the future .
1	i really like this song and i hope it will be a big hit for you .
0	this is my first album that i have not been excited about . when i got it i wa not expecting that much , but i wa wrong ! it is got a lot good song . every song on here is good . the only song i would not recommend is i am a believer . it is not a bad song , but i still would not recommend it .

0	i like this song . there are some good thing about this cd : ( 1 ) it play at the same time that the radio station do ; ( 2 ) the sound quality is excellent . there are a few thing that detract from the whole : this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start again - each time it doe the same thing . the vocal are weak . the drum are fine but the bass is weak . the guitar is fine but the riff are boring . i have a song of gob that ha a similar bass sound to this one . ( 3 ) the lyric are lame and the feel of the song is not like the other one . in general , this one is a waste of money . ( 4 ) if anything , the bonus track are even worse . gob is the one with the most potential . this is a great song , but gob is the one with the most potential . ( 5 ) the bonus track are a waste of time . you could have done something better with them .

0	kiss is one of the song that i like the most . it is a really fun danceable song , and if it happens to get on the radio , i will be sure to play it . the only thing that i do not like is the lyric , because they were written in a way that is not too positive , but in a way that make it seem positive . i would not know about this music if it were not for this song . i do not know what the song is trying to say , but it is just not good . i would rather listen to something that is bad than listen to something that is good .

1	one of the best album of the year .
0	love this album ! this album is really good . and the sound is really crisp , and the song are all in the right key . but i am just not a fan of the vocal . sometimes the vocal are not in the right key and they sound a bit like a robot . but other time , they are great . if you are a fan of oldie music , then this album is definitely not to be missed .

1	great song . the movie wa better .
0	i am a big fan of frosted glass i think it is by the talking head and i like other song by them too . it is fun to listen to the talking head and you have to give them credit for their work . this song is also fun , you will notice a difference . i am not one to say if a song is bad , but i can tell you it is not a hit by the talking head . i thought the music wa good , but the vocal just did not make a hit by them . i am a big fan of the talking head but this song just did not fit . i still enjoy the song and it is still fun to listen to and ha stayed with me . i am sure the talking head are going to record a version of this on their next cd .

1	this is the first cd i have ever bought from amazon . it is been over 20 year since i have purchased anything from them . i have a little over 2000 cd and over 300 book . this is the first cd i ever bought from amazon . i wa not impressed .
0	i do not know if i like this album . i do not like the vocal . the song are good , but they are just too slow for my taste . i do like the production of this album , which wa done by the talented tommy liber . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , who sang the lead vocal on i am with you today . the rest of the song are very forgettable .
0	very cool . i like the dave clark five version better at this point .
1	i have listened to this cd several time . i have loved it . the song are different . they are all really good and i like them .
1	this is the first album by this band i have heard . i have never heard the band before . the music is very reminiscent of the old rock and roll sound . my ear are open for a new band from time to time , and this band deserves more attention . i have listened to the album twice and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys pop rock . it is a very good album for the price . the song do not stop is very catchy , and the rest of the song are all very fun .
0	some of the lyric were funny , but the rest of the lyric were boring . the guitar wa good , the vocal were ok , it all sounded a little too much like other band song . overall , i thought this wa an ok album , but i would not recommend it .

0	i am a huge fan of this band , but this is not a good a i thought it would be . it ha been rerecorded , and is a little bit different from the original version . i give it 1 star .
1	a the title suggests , this is another one of the new album from the late great jan garbarek . i wa expecting something more in the classical vein , and wa not disappointed . his vocal are very nice , and the instrumental playing is very good , if not quite up to scratch . he ha a new album out with nonesuch record , and it is worth picking up - i am sure i will have a listen to the cd before i make my final decision .
1	i found out about this album in the late ninety from a friend who knew about the band ( she actually met them when the band played at a bar in my hometown ) . i wa intrigued by the fact that the band seemed to be a band that i would like to have a chance to interview . i went to their website and found out that they appeared on an episode of the soprano , and i wa hooked .
0	i purchased this cd to get my voice ready for a singing competition . i am not going to waste it . i would not recommend this cd .
0	i am a very satisfied customer . i will continue to buy your product .

0	there are some good track here , but also some very bad track , the song i hated were fantastic and wake me up
1	i have to say , i like her song . i listened to her song .
0	i liked this cd much better than the one with the bad rap . it wa a nice change from the usual weird sound .
0	the lamento is the best version of the song , hand down .
0	i like country music , and this cd is very good .
1	this is a great album , i agree . i like the album a lot .
0	i downloaded this album to try it out . it work great . i can not believe how much these song sound like the movie music . the album is amazing . i played all of the song and i really enjoyed them . i would definitely buy this album one day .
1	i purchased this album a a gift for my husband . i am a worship leader , so i like to encourage my worship team and they all like this album . i especially like the song that are encouraging and uplifting . i would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a worship album that is uplifting and encouraging .
0	i love to listen to this song when i am doing my tax .
0	i think this is a very good album . i just did not like the song . i found the vocal to be a bit weak and i did not like the instrumentation . the song satellite is a good song by the new pornographer , but i am not there is a poor song . i liked the sound of the new pornographer a a group . they have the same sort of sound a the velvet underground , but without the vocal . one day , i hope that they will record a song that is like i am not there but with a better sound . until that time , they were a good band .
0	karajan wa a huge star in his day and the man music continues to be played on the radio today , but i have to say that this cd is not karajans best . the music is fine , but the production is a bit low in the mix and the vocal are often a bit muddled . perhaps if the music wa better recorded , the singing would be good .
1	when i wa younger , i loved this music . i thought it wa so beautiful and had such a beautiful sound to it . i miss it so much .
1	i love marie on this cd . she ha such a beautiful voice and she sound so sincere . i really enjoy her cd . i would highly recommend this cd . thank you .

1	very cool and cool song .
1	i find the song by this artist to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this is a very very very nice song .
0	a very good album .
1	this is my favorite song on the album . the lyric are so touching . if you like it you should listen to this album .
0	this is a great record store . i think the best thing about this store is that people can buy their own cassette tape ! i bought my first record here , and i have been coming back ever since .
0	i thought this one wa going to be an awful cd but i wa wrong , it is a great one .
1	this is a great rendition of the song . i like the arrangement a lot . the sound quality is great a well . the lyric are the same a the john kander version . the only difference between this version and the kander version is the lyric . i am still enjoying listening to this cd .
0	this is probably the best radio show i have ever heard .
1	i have listened to all of his cd and this wa my first cd i have listened to . i absolutely love his cd and this wa a very different type of cd . the cd is beautiful and the sound quality is excellent . i am very impressed with the quality of this cd , and i hope to purchase more of his cd in the future !
0	i have to say , when i first put this cd in to my player , i wa expecting something akin to the white album , but in a much more traditional manner . i guess i wa a bit disappointed by the lack of innovation . but after listening to this album , i have come to realize that i wa wrong . i actually like the beatles a lot , but i think this is their best album . their other album are just not a good a this one .
0	i love the music of elvis presley so i wa excited about this album . i wa happy to see that he is still alive and well and making music . however , i wa not impressed . even with a $ 14.95 price tag , the quality of the sound is not what i had expected . it is not loud and it is not very clear . i am disappointed . i have only listened to 2 song so far .
1	my mom love elton john and i am not . i think it is cool to listen to these cover so i thought i would try this one .
1	r.kelly is a master of the piano .
0	i love the song and i think it is funny how i just like it . i do not know why , but it just happens . i do not know if anyone else like it , but i like it and i like it alot .
0	the cd is well-made and in excellent sound quality , but i am not sure whether i like it . the sound quality is quite good , but the lyric are not very good .
0	i love the intro to this song and the title . the song is a really nice version of an old song that i am not familiar with .
0	i like this cd . but it is the same song over and over . i do not really know why people enjoy this cd so much .
1	i am a first time listener , but i fell in love with this record . i love the lyric , and the sound of it . i hope this album keep coming . i bought it when it first came out . it is worth every penny .
1	i saw it on my wall today and i wa blown away ! i have never heard a song that really made me feel the way this did , and i wanted to cry . i feel inspired by this song !
1	i have heard good thing about this album but this is the only one i have heard . what i love most about this album is the diversity of the voice . i do not remember hearing this variety of voice before .
1	i love you . love you .
1	i have got a couple of these album and have not heard a bad song from either of them . this album is very good . the song are all well performed and i have enjoyed each album . i am having a hard time finding the song on the cd .
1	i just bought this yesterday . it is an amazing cd . i like it . i think that the piano player is a good one .
1	this is one of my favorite cd of all time . it is the soundtrack to one of the worst movie of all time , but it is a great album . the production is fantastic , and the music is so good . it is definitely worth picking up .
0	it is a good song , and the music video ha come out and it is great . i like the video alot . i would like to have the cd on cd .
0	this is not an album jewel released . this is a cd jewel put out to promote her new record ( i still have the cd in my room ) . the new song are great , and i like the new recording , but it wa not released a an album . the only redeeming feature of the new song is the song i am a bird ( which is on this cd , in the liner note ) .
0	this is the best jazz album of the decade .
0	this is more of a conumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait this is a live recording of the first and nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert , perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very dis-concerting .
1	this is very good song . i like it very much .
0	it doe not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money . i do not know why there are no word a i have heard this song many time before , and do not know how to describe it .
1	i have only listened to one album from bruno mar and this is it
0	barbra sings very well .
1	i thought this song wa a little cheesy , but the movie wa awesome .
1	this is the biggest song on the soundtrack . i wa glad i bought it so i could have it on my ipod and listen to it while i wa driving .
1	i am a long-time fan of jewel and have been since the 80 . i am a big fan of her earlier album ( gim me shelter , the black album , and the love song ) and feel her to be a great singer and songwriter . the new album is different from all her other album in that it ha a more upbeat feel . it is a great album and i am looking forward to her next album a well . i have had the jewel cd for year and have been a fan of it . i wa upset when i heard they would not be releasing an album with her . i wa really upset and am glad i got my cd back so i can listen to it again . i love this album and hope she will record another one .
1	the song is good : )
1	this album is an excellent example of what a good recording should be . you should get a copy , it is fantastic .
0	i am a huge fan of r.kelly . i have listened to his album ( at a much slower speed ) because i know he still ha more to come . if you are a fan of r.kelly and you enjoy his music then you will enjoy this cd .
0	i don ; t know what they are talking about . i do not think you need to know what the movie is , but it would help if you did . and i do not understand why you say it is the same song when it really is not . maybe i am not understanding what you are saying .
0	very relaxing , good background vocal . if you do not mind the occasional pop song this is a great relaxing album .
1	i wa excited to listen to this cd since it is my favorite cd of all time . the cd ha good song . i would recommend this cd to everyone !
1	i am listening to this album . i am about to write a review on it . i have listened to the cd twice . the first song is god of all living and the second is prayer to god . i have heard that this album is very inspirational . i like this album and am glad that i got this album for my own personal collection . i like it and will listen to it again . i wa also looking for another christian album that wa more gospel oriented . this album wa definitely what i wa looking for . i am glad i got this album and i will be buying from this company again .
1	this is a great recording . great mix . great vocal . great orchestra .
0	i bought this cd because it wa a live recording from a concert . i enjoy a live concert , so i bought this cd . it is really good . i would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys live music . it is very good . i give this album 4 star .
0	i wa surprised by the musicality of this song . i thought it wa going to be a really simple song with a very simple beat .
1	i like this song a lot . it is a catchy song and i like the song a lot .
0	i am sure many of you have seen this , but i wanted to share my experience with the program . i downloaded this song last night and tried to play it on my window phone . i wa not able to get the song to play , and i am not sure why .
0	i am trying to learn a song by a band i really like . i downloaded it for practice , and it is not working for me .
1	i had no idea jeff buckley played guitar until i saw the video on youtube . i had never listened to any of his music before and got hooked . i will definitely be buying this album when i get home .
1	this song wa fun to listen to . it is a good song . the lyric are a little bit funny . the video is cute a well . this song is a great dance song . i can not wait to see the video . i think it is a really great song . i love it .
1	i love this cd . this is a perfect christmas cd . it contains every song that i have ever liked on any christmas cd from the 40 up to the present . it is also a great cd to play on the christmas tree ( with the light on ) . i love this cd . my favorite christmas cd . i love this cd . i love this cd . i love this cd .
0	i like hasselvanders song . he is a very talented singer .
0	i bought this for my granddaughter for christmas . she is almost five year old and i think she will enjoy it . since i have been listening to her when she wa younger , i think she will like it . i have bought her other cd and they were good , but this one is the best . i think she will like it . if she doe not , i will be giving her a copy of this one . it is worth the price . i think it is a good gift for little child . i would not buy it again .
1	i have been listening to this cd non-stop since i ordered it . it is great ! i love it .
0	i would recommend this album to a friend , but i would not go out and buy it myself . i like her album one more day , but the song on this album are too repetitive .
1	the best trance album i have ever heard ! if i did not already know this , this is the best trance album i have heard !
0	if you are not a fan of a live show or have not seen a live show in a long time , this cd is a must have . i have been searching for day for a good live concert cd , and found only one of these . it is definitely a good album , but i am not a fan of live concert . i hope that i can find a version of this cd that ha a band doing a live show , but i doubt it , a this is more of a concert cd than anything else . for example , there is no sound of the band tuning the guitar , or playing the solo , or anything . it is just a concert cd .
0	the beatles i am the walrus is a great song . the soloing of the drum is the best ( in my opinion ) part of the song . the bass is ok and the drum do not make much noise . they make noise and they are not very loud . the bass is very important to this song , because it is the most prominent part of the song . the guitar are a little short and the lyric are not very good . i would give it a 4/5 because the solo of the drum is the best part of the song in my mind .
0	i think i will pas on this one . it ha a nice little melody , but it doe not really grab me like other song on this album . even during the chorus .
0	i have been a longtime fan of the tom scott band . i have never been a fan of his singing . but , i do enjoy having him a a part of the band . this is a solid album , but i will not buy it . it is a shame , because i think it is a good album . i like it . i will buy it if i ever hear it on the radio .
1	a classic . great sound . i love the oldie stuff . i would give this album a 7 star rating . it is very enjoyable , and the only reason i gave it three star is because the music is very hard to find . i would recommend this album to anyone . it is worth the extra money , and if you do not have it already , get it immediately .
0	this is a great collection of song . i really liked the song . i really liked the way that the song were arranged .
0	this is just a very bad song .
0	i love this song , but i have to agree with the other reviewer . the lyric are offensive to woman , and this is a song that is supposed to be about woman .
1	the music is top notch . it is a very good listen . when i started to listen to this cd , i thought it wa the best that i heard . i thought it wa very good and i liked a lot of the song . the lyric are great , and the song are very well written . i am very impressed . i am really happy with this cd .
1	i loved this album . it is a good pop album . i especially like the song all that i need and if you love me . the song themselves are good . i liked the video a well .
1	i have never bought an album this short before , and i am glad i did . it is a very good album .
1	this album wa very good . it ha a lot of good worship song .
1	i bought it for my son , since he ha a crush on christina aguilera . he is a huge christina aguilera fan , and i have been playing her music on the radio for him . he love this song so much , he even sings it on the radio . he play the song to his friend and family , and they all love it . i have been playing it to my husband , and he love it too . i have played this song to him every time he get a chance , and he always say it is a great song .
1	this is an awesome song . i like it .
1	i got this album in the mail today . i have a new found love for hard rock . some of the song on the album remind me of ac/dc . i guess i am not much of a fan of ac/dc , but i really like this album . i have bought several album by ac/dc , but this one is the best . good for any metal fan .
1	this song is really different from the rest of the song on here . i like it .
0	my personal favorite on this cd is the best place in the world it is a very nice song to go to sleep to when you are traveling . it is a very nice , happy song .
1	this album sound like it wa recorded live . the music is very good and the band is very entertaining .
0	this is one of my favorite and most popular tape . i would recommend this tape to any person who like jazz , not so much for jazz .
0	i know it is a little pricey , but i think it is well worth the money .
0	i like the album , i like the song , i like the lyric .
0	well , the album itself is decent , but the song are not . there are some beautiful song on this album , but the rest are just a bunch of commercial christian song , which is a waste of your money . this album is an easy listen , but it is not good . i would definitely not buy this album if you listen to it .
0	not bad , but she need to lose the singing voice . if you want to hear her sing , then buy her cd . i am not a jewel fan , but she is a great singer and a great song writer . it is not her fault that she ha to work so many hour to make a living , but she is not a bad person and she is not a bad singer . she just ha some serious problem . maybe she will go back to being a normal human being , and she will just have to learn to live with the fact that she is a pop star .
0	i would rather have listened to this album in the car than on my mp3 player .
1	this new release is more like what i have come to expect from jewel . this is not to say it is a bad cd . the vocal are amazing . it is just that i have come to expect too much from her . the song i do like are more of the same ; i will just get used to them .
1	i have yet to find a version of this song i like more than the one on the cd , a i have found other song on the cd to be very annoying and distracting . this version is also my favorite .
1	i liked listening to the song on this cd . i really enjoyed listening to the song on this cd .
1	i love this album ! i think this album is one of the best jazz album of all time . i have listened to this album a very , very , very long time . i love the lyric on these song , and the music , the music is so good . i wa very excited when i ordered this album , and i wa not disappointed . i have listened to this album a lot . i love this album . now i can appreciate this album a lot more . i never thought that i would listen to an album for five year . i love this album . i love the album . i love the album and the lyric . i love the music . i love the music . i love the lyric . i love the lyric , the music , and the album .
0	i like the album alot .
1	this is probably one of the best radio show i have ever heard .
0	i really like this album , but really have to say that i like the instrumentals more . i would like to have more instrumentals on this album .
0	i downloaded the cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like using the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i would not recommend this cd .
0	i do not know what happened to this guy . i do not get it . he is been so brilliant , everyone else is just copying him .
0	this album is very mediocre . it is just a very generic album with a lot of filler . i am not a fan of prince but i bought this album for my kid and their friend . they listen to it all the time and have started singing along . i do not think i will buy his other album because they are just filler .
0	this cd is a wonderful collection of song , from the 20th century . a wonderful collection of song . each song a gem , and a treasure .
1	i am so happy to have found this site . it is the best site for buying and selling used music . i wa looking for a used dave clark five cd , but i could not find it . i looked for a while , but nothing wa available .
0	i have a few favorite on this album . this is one of them . the bass line and the guitar solo is great . the vocal are also good .
0	i really do not get why this song is on this album . it sound nothing like the other song on the album . the band never made an album called the best of the best . they had one album called the best of the best , and one album called the best of the best of , and one album called the best of the best of the best of the best of . that just doe not make any sense . i understand that they wanted to put a song with the title the best of the best of . but i do not think anyone ha ever heard it . i guess you can not please everyone , but they should have at least tried to make the song a little bit more original .
0	i heard this song first , and thought it wa really good . it ha a great vibe to it , but i can not stand the lyric or the music .
1	this is the best cd i own .
0	i liked this cd , but i wa hoping that the artist would put out more music like this . instead , they have gone on to put out one of the weakest cd ever .
1	this is the first sam sparro cd i have listened to . i love it .
1	this album is great . the first song i am back is the best . the third song i am alive is the best . the fourth song i am in love is the best . this album is great .
1	i love the sound of this song and the message in it . i am going to buy this cd to remember the good time we had together .
1	i have heard this song a few time on the radio , but have never seen this song played on any television show or album . i like this version more than the one i have heard so many time before . this is actually the first time i have ever heard the song sung by a woman .
0	i can not stand this song ! the chord on the guitar are terrible ! i like this song but not the version in the movie !
0	i do not feel this album is worth buying . i purchased it hoping for a complete compilation of her work , and i am disappointed . i do not understand why she did not release a new cd with the other song from her first 4 album , or at least a deluxe collection of all her song . i would have bought the entire collection , and would have paid a small amount more , but it would have been worth it for her to include the other song . also the album doe not have any great song on it that i really like . i find the song to be average in quality , but uninteresting , and i had purchased her first 4 album to hear the music i had not heard before . if she ever release a new cd with all of her song , i will buy it . if not i will wait until she release another album with more of her music .
0	it is a good song , but the last song is too fast .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a while now and i love it . it is a musical journey that take you on a spiritual journey . allan bole
0	it is mp3 download . the product wa exactly what wa advertised . once again , i did not receive what wa advertised .
0	not the movie version , but the original version of the song is not the same .
1	he is doing a good job of keeping the band together and keeping the fan interested . this album ha good music .
0	i like the music and the singing but the album is not worth $ 20 .
0	it go fast
0	i have been a fan of jewel . i like their stuff , but this is a joke . i can not believe i have been a fan for this long and i have to put this on here .
1	i love this song . it is a great song . i really like it . i love this song .
0	this is an excellent cd . it is a great choice for someone who ha trouble sleeping . it is a relaxing cd that is sure to put you to sleep . i have purchased several of her other cd and have enjoyed them all . if you are looking for a soothing cd that will help you fall asleep , this is a great choice .
0	i will be there is a fantastic song . the video is wonderful .
0	i have heard this song on the radio , and i have been in love with it since i first heard it . i have been listening to it on repeat every day since , and it always make me smile .
0	i am not sure what to make of this . i know that this is the last song on the album , and it sound like it could be a breakup song , especially when the other two song use the same songwriting and arrangement . but when these two song are so similar . i found it a bit annoying .
0	wow , this cd is great . i have heard that after the who is live at the roxy album , there are some issue with the sound quality . i bought this cd on the recommendation of an amazon associate , and i am glad i did . i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not delighted . the sound quality is good and the cd ha a few good song , but the lyric are not great .
1	if there is one single that can be played on the fiddle and still be amazing it isi do not know . this song is one that will never get old .
0	no , it is not the same song . it is a great version , this one , in which the song is performed with a live band , and the band is very good , and the song is very good , and they sound great .
0	i like the song . the video is not something i will watch . maybe i will later , but i think i will end up playing this for my friend .
0	just an fyi , this is the first time i have heard this song and it is awesome .
0	i wa really looking forward to this album , it is a really great album . i think the song are all good but the only thing that i do not like is that it is repetitive .
0	this song wa awesome .
1	i really love this song and the video .
0	this is not a christian album - at all . this album is a very commercial , corporate , christian artist . the song are not of biblical value . i would not buy this album either . i am disappointed . this album is a waste of your money .
1	this is the first time i have heard this set of music that i really enjoyed . the music is very well played and there is no doubt that the quality of the recording is very good for this era . i really like this set of music . it wa my first impression of the music i have heard on this album and for that i have to make a special note of it . it is just a very enjoyable listening experience .
0	this is the worst album i have ever spent money on . i have heard it twice now , and it is still on my computer . i do not know why it is still on my computer . it is not worth it . i am disappointed in the whole process , and i am getting the impression that it will only get worse . i would rather be reading a book or sitting at home watching tv . i really do not understand why this album is costing me so much money . it is not worth it .
0	i dont think you need to know what the song is about . i do .
0	i will be the first to admit , i am not a real fan of jewel . i do not care for her music or her personality . but i love her album , which are all worth owning . i have a great appreciation for her song , and that is why i will be the first to admit that i am a very short seller with this disc . i have only listened to it once , and after listening to it for only a couple of second , i am left with a very negative , and somewhat disappointing , opinion of the entire album . so if you like jewel , i suggest you stop reading now and put this disc down , and instead head to your local record shop and pick up some jewel cd . they are all about the same , and they are all much better than this . i hope this disc becomes available on itunes , but for now , i suggest you search amazon and order this album from there . you will not be disappointed . and you will probably like a lot better .
0	i really enjoyed this album . the band ha a unique sound that is not often found in christian music . when i listened to it for the first time , i wa extremely impressed with the band quality . i could not believe the quality of their talent . i enjoyed the track that had a lot of different style and different type of music . i wa not disappointed in this album . i will listen to it several more time .
1	this song is great !
1	this is a great album , but i do not know why they did not put out the rest of the album . it wa really easy to listen to , and the lyric are very deep and meaningful . i really enjoyed it .
0	i like this song . it is a little heavy for me but it is a good song . it is a good song for woman to listen to . not for men . men , listen to this song . it will change your life !
0	this is one of the top album of the 90 .
0	i love this new cd . it is a great collection of song . the one song i did not like is the first one . then i just went to the rest of the cd and liked it . overall , it is a very good collection of song .

1	i liked this song and thought it wa a great song .
0	this is the first time i have heard this song , and i think it is very catchy . but i can not see myself buying the album .
0	this album is good , but it is a little on the slow side .
0	great album full of great music and good arrangement .
0	i had this thing with this cd a couple of night ago and i wa playing it , then i decided to open the case and it wa gone . i am very mad about that .
0	this cd wa very nice . i have to agree with the other reviewer , it is just a tad repetative .
1	i have already bought the two previous dave clark five album ( state of trance 1994 and state of trance 2004 ) . this one is a great album , with ton of song to choose from . the song wake up is one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	i like this album . it is great ! i like it a lot . you should listen to it .
1	this is a great album . it ha a good mix of hard rock and electronic music . i will be re-listening to it .
1	this album wa a fun listen . i like the variety of the song on it .
0	this is my second favorite hammond album . i can listen to this all day long . it is a little weird though . the music is great , but the vocal are a letdown .
1	this song is awesome . the vocal are great and the guitar work is great . the bass is great . the drummer is great . i love the song . i love the chorus . i will not be with you no more !

0	the only good song on the album is if i had a gun ( hallelujah ) , which is very powerful and inspiring , and is the only song that really show that she can sing . but i am alright sound terrible and ha no emotion . the album is very much like a poor version of the best of both world .
1	this is an excellent album , the quality is excellent and the song are very entertaining . lyrically , the album is a joy to listen to . i highly recommend this album to anyone looking for a quality album , that doe not take itself too seriously .
1	this album wa amazing . i love maria houghton voice . she is very talented . i love the song . i wish that perry como would record more christmas music .
1	loved the song . it is fun and easy to sing .
0	i wa hoping this would be a song for the age , but it is all over the place and kinda pointless . the song is not bad , but it is not a masterpiece either .
1	i have listened to this cd of song for many year . it is a very good and well produced cd . the song are well arranged and the sound quality is excellent . i would certainly recommend this cd to anyone wanting to listen to music from the first decade of the 21st century .
1	this is a great cd , a i said , i have heard all the cd version of this movie , and they are all the same , it is annoying , but not a annoying a the movie
0	this is the most amazing cover .
0	i really like this album , a lot of good stuff . it is just what i want . i wish i could get the album in mp3 .
0	this is not just a christmas song , but one that i would consider a classic christmas song . it is the first time i have seen a christmas song that i enjoy so much . i am not sure how old i am , but i am probably in my 30 . a a kid , christmas wa always a big deal , and it did not matter if i wa rich or poor , it wa all about the present . when i wa a kid , i used to make a list of the present i wanted to receive . this song is the soundtrack to the joy of family , friend and present .
1	wow . this cd is really good . it ha a lot of great music in it . i have a few friend that are fan of ohearn . i tell them all about his music . it is just amazing . i hope they all enjoy this cd .
0	i do not think it is better than any of the other album it ha been re-released on .
1	i love my ipod touch . it ha this song on it and i listen to it everytime i get home from work .
0	this album is a great album . i wa looking for a new album to buy and i found this one . i listened to the cd a little over a week ago . i have to admit that i wa a little bit surprised by the cd . it is a lot more upbeat than i wa expecting . the cd sound different than the cd i had heard before . i do not want to say it is better , but it is certainly different from the cd i had before . it is good , but it not great . it is a lot of fun . you can really tell that you are listening to a really good album . this is the kind of album i like . it is not a perfect album . but it is a lot of fun . it is very easy to listen to . the song are mostly great . and i really like the first cd of this album . this album is one of those cd that you just can not put down . if i had a recommendation for an album to buy i would go for this one .
0	i have to say that this song actually doe not sound like anything , but ha been used in a lot of movie and show and it ha gotten a lot of bad review . so , i will give it a 5 from me .
1	hasselville wa a very good show . the song were very good . i did not like the piano section . i liked that he sang the background music .
1	i love tom wait . i own several cd by him . i have loved his music for year . i love his voice . i have listened to all his album . he is an amazing singer . he is my favorite singer .
0	good album , but it is a little too long for my taste . the song are also not very good .
0	love this band , but this album doe not sound like this band . more like something you would expect from a band like jethro
1	i really like it and i am glad i bought it .
1	i am amazed at how much i like this song . it is a great song . it is a very beautiful song . it ha such a great melody and such a beautiful violin solo , and the violin solo is really beautiful . i think this is a great song .

1	the song are great , and the band is fantastic ! i like the music of this band !

1	it wa a great christmas present for my wife . it is a great gift to give .
1	this is so good . i love the song . i have been a fan for so long
0	if you enjoy this kind of music there is no such thing a a bad band . check out this band . i am not sure if any of you have ever heard the band , but they are on my favorite band list . the band is called the big lebowski , and they have released 7 album . the 7th album is called the big lebowski ( the new album ) . i have only heard the first album through the cd . i am very much looking forward to hearing the new album . i have heard some of the song on the first album . the song on the first album do not sound a good a the new album . but the band ha just started getting their second album out and it will be out in the new year . so look out for the new album . i really like all of their album so far . the band ha been around since the 90 . they are a very good band . i highly recommend you check out this band .
1	this is my all time favorite beatles album . it is the best beatles album i have ever heard .
1	i bought this cd after listening to it several time . i really like the different instrumentals .
0	i am a fan of hammond and enjoy his work . i really like this album . i think it is the best one he ha released in a while . i also think the album is too long . i would cut it down .
1	i love this song . the lyric are so relatable .
0	this is a very good album . the music is very melodic , but it is very repetitive . it is a little bit like listening to the same cd over and over again . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good trance album .
0	i think the song is pretty much perfect for this movie , and i also think that the movie is well worth it and that the music fit the mood perfectly . the movie is about a father who go to a concert in which a guy who wa an astronaut and a musician get killed so that his wife doe not lose her job . the wife , who wa also an astronaut , is heartbroken over what happened and decides that she is going to get drunk and become a recluse to escape the pain . the father and his wife go to the concert and get drunk , and the father is killed when he fall off the stage . the mother dy of a heart attack in the bathroom and the father wife dy in her apartment .
1	i like this album . i love the song , the production and the musicianship is top notch .
0	this is a great song . i do not understand why miley is getting so much hate . it ha a beautiful melody and wa written by a talented composer .
0	the climb by j.s . bach is a great song .
0	when i bought this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd .
0	this song is from the movie the rocky horror picture show . but it is not the same song a on film , so you are going to have to listen to the movie to know what i am talking about .
0	i have been singing this for over 5 year and my child still love it . i would like to know how to download the original recording . i have a cd player at home so it doe not matter if i can not download the cd version , but i would like to hear the original recording .
1	this beautiful song really touched me . i love this song .
0	i bought this book from amazon . it arrived today . the cover is beautiful , but the cover art is really terrible . the music is not good , but it is not bad . it is the type of music that i would expect to hear in an oldie rock station .
1	i have enjoyed listening to this cd on and off for the last few week . it is a great cd .
1	largest selection of electronic music on the internet .
0	the first thing that struck an eye wa the lack of rhythm . the vocal are in there but the music is choppy and out of sync . the second thing wa the lack of the song that the band ha been playing and singing for the last 10 year . it is the song that we all grew up on that have been played and sung for so long . this is like having the same beatles song played over and over and over and over again . the lyric are simple and the vocal seem monotonous . the melody are repetitive and do not have any depth to them . when i first heard this cd i wa really impressed but after listening to it a few time i find it lacking . i am not sure what the point of this cd is unless it is to drive you crazy .
1	this song make me cry .
0	i can not believe i wasted money on this . i bought this for my collection . if i had to go back to the store to buy this , i would be going on ebay .
0	this song is ok , but it is not bad . the vocal are fine and it ha a nice beat . it is a good song .
1	i have to say that i am so pleased with the cd . it wa a great purchase .
1	i think it is a powerful song . i do not think it is a very good song .
1	i love this song . i believe it is one of the greatest american love song of all time . i can not wait until it is on the radio .
1	this song wa great when i wa younger . never heard it before .
1	this app helped my son get his first word to read . he could read all the way through this book . a must have in every parent bookshelf !
0	very weak . the band is not a very good live band , the sound seems very muddy , and there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too weak to make it sound great .
0	i hate miley cyrus . she is disgusting . she is a fake . she is not talented . she doe not sing . her voice is horrible . i hope she get on the plane to la and go to rehab and get help .
0	i like the song but i wish it would say something like i am a good girl . i am a good boy . i am a bad boy . i hate my life . that would be a great song .
0	this song is the worst song of all time . i am glad i stopped buying cd , i hate this song almost a much a i hate what is up ! .
1	i am glad that i found this album . it is different from the other r & b album that i have heard . the album is a great album . i will buy again !
1	i believe jesus love you and care about you . you have an amazing family and they are all wonderful . i believe this is a great christmas song to sing .
0	this song is ok. i will check out the other song .
1	this is a good song . i think it is a little too long , though . but it is not like there have been other song like this .
0	this cd ha some of my favorite song of all time . the vocal are great , the music is great , and the lyric are great . it ha some of the best lyric i have ever heard . the cd is very enjoyable and the song are great .
1	i really like the song . i wa listening to it and the song reminded me of a great song from a country artist .
1	this app is awesome ! i love it .
0	this is a good disc . it is not nearly a good a the keith side discography but it ha one of keiths best guitar solo .
0	i really enjoyed this song . i thought it wa funny . it is just a quirky song that you can not deny .
0	a very good album with a lot of very nice and very unique song . the melody are very nice and the lyric are very nice . the rhythm is a bit too fast and the melody are not very much . there are some good tune here which are just not a important a the others .
0	this album make me want to use this website le . i do not need another artist that ha the same voice and is out there in the music industry . i know there is a lot of talent out there , but this is it for me .
1	this album is great . i have listened to it in one sitting , and it is fantastic .
0	this is a great song to relax to , especially on a hot day when we are sitting on the porch watching the bird .
0	i really like this song . it is one of my top 5 favorite song . i have listened to this song over and over again , and i can not get enough of it . i really love this song .
0	this is one of mileys most hated song . i agree with the others . this song is awful , boring , and annoying .
0	a better song than the last one .
1	i saw the broadway production of fiddler on the roof last night . i am a big fan of fiddler on the roof . i have watched the show many time , and i have to say i love it . i think it is one of the best musical ever made . it is a very good show , and i recommend it to everyone .
1	this is probably the best r.kelly album of all his album . it is perfect . the best is the truth and it is the best r.kelly album . i like all his other album . it is probably the best r.kelly album of all his album . i like all his other cd . i think this is his best album . i think i will buy this cd once i have given it a listen .
1	i bought this for a friend a a birthday gift . i am very happy with the purchase . the cd is really good . it ha a great tune , and the lyric are good and easy to understand .
1	this is a real shame . the record is an amalgamation of many style and era , from the blue to the funk , from early rock to modern pop , and everything in between . a true example of why jps album are so special , and why the quality of his playing on this one is a good a any of his other work . his playing is excellent , and his vocal is pure , emotional and soaring .

0	i do not see how this is an album at all . there are no song from the point of view of a guy perspective . the music is very rock like with some acoustic guitar and a couple of synth track . i just do not see any difference between this and other rock album .
0	when i first heard this cd i wa pleasantly surprised with the quality of the cd . unfortunately , i wa not pleased with the audio quality , but it wa not for lack of trying . i had to purchase a better audio player to be able to listen to the music . i feel jewel should have written song that are more personal and le like a corporate-produced cd . i find it disappointing that she released this cd and doe not seem to have the motivation , talent , or inspiration to write new material .
0	good cd , but the lyric on this cd are not what i expected .
0	i think i would have loved to have met him . i saw him in concert a few year ago and he wa very good and i wa very impressed .
1	this music is so good . i never heard the chicago symphony orchestra play like this . i have always heard that the chicago symphony orchestra is so old fashioned . i really liked this recording .
1	i have listened to this cd and i am convinced that it is the best available recording of this kind . the sound is clear and the recording are mostly very interesting . i am pleased with the work done by alan lomax who made these recording a well a with the excellent liner note . a very good addition to the library of music and the brain , which is now at least in the hand of dr. ornstein .
0	i am a huge fan of this band . the opening lyric are so great . i just love the song chorus . i love the song on this album .
1	this is a great album for christian , but not necessarily religious . i think that the message is important , but i do not agree with the reviewer that the message is not effective . i love the song on this album , and they are all very powerful . one track that ha really had an effect on me is praise god , the song that the reviewer mentioned . it is a very powerful song , and one that i have had a very great effect on me . i love the message and the song . i think that the reviewer is wrong , and i do not think that her comment is fair . the song just say praise god , and that is all it say . i love that she sings the song praise god because of the word that she sings . she sings the word into my heart . she sings the word that i need to hear . she sings the word that i need to believe , that i need to hear . i have listened to many christian music album , but this may be the only one that i will ever listen to .
1	this is a must read for any woman . i have read it twice and am looking forward to the third time around . it is a great story with a message for single woman , and a great love story .
0	it is a nice song . i usually enjoy it , even though there are some creepy lyric . the song sound like it should have a guitar solo at the end , for a quick change of pace .
1	i liked this song , but the video is a little cheesy .
1	i thought this cd wa really good . it wa a great introduction to the artist . i have had it for a while and i have not been disappointed . this cd is worth the money . there are many artist that do not have the opportunity to get a chance to play for u but this is one of them . i would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of jazz . this cd is worth it .
0	this collection is great , but i would not buy it if it were available . it is still too rare .
1	this is a solid album . for me this is the best trance album i have ever heard . it is very good and very well produced .
1	a song on the movie the notebook . it is a very well known movie and i like it .
0	his music is very relaxing and very beautiful ! i love it when i have a song that i can listen to for hour and i know that it will be something i will enjoy again and again .
0	this is the best cd i have heard from the dave clark five in my opinion . i do not think i have ever heard a cd that sound a good a this one . it is a shame that the cd is not a good a the original lp . the original lp wa released in 1980. you had to get it in 1981 or 1982. this cd wa released , by the way , in 1981 .
0	this is a bad album , and i am not too far into it , so i dont know what to expect . this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever seen , and is not at all what i would expect from a christian album . i can not really listen to it all the way through . i would like to give it another chance , but i am not sure i can . it is a pretty dull album . i will listen to it a part of my christmas music , but i am not going to buy it .
0	i wa a little put off by the all-inclusive version . i feel like it would be great on a cd where the artist ha the opportunity to cover any song they want . i am not sure if i get the point of releasing a cd with all the song a all-inclusive and you have to buy the song you want . this is not that song though . i am not sure if i get the point of selling a cd with all the song in it . i think i will download all the song i want .

0	i like the album . i like the songwriting on the album . it is very good . i do not like the song , and the album sound much better without it . and , at least it is a decent album . but , i do not understand why someone would put this song on a compilation album with the others . it is a terrible song . i like a lot of the other song on the album , but not this song . i will listen to this song again , but not on a compilation album .
0	i do not know why there is a whole website devoted to this song . i really like it , but i do not know why there is a whole website devoted to it .
1	this is a great compilation of various song . i like all of them , but the first 2 song are my favorite ( i think ) . i wa listening to them on a walk and thought about how much i liked them ( i love this genre ) . i like the way the song are arranged . i like that they are from different decade , and i like that the song are arranged in such a way that they are very easy to sing along with .
0	this is a boring song and the lyric are terrible . this is the worst song ever . the only redeeming thing about this is that it ha a great beat . it sound like a beat from a rap song . it is the worst song i have ever heard . the only redeeming thing about this is that i wa able to keep track of the time . it wa like 4:00 am or something . i wish i could have stayed awake until 6:00 am to listen to it . i wish i could have stayed awake just to listen to it . it wa a good song , but it is not worth the money .
0	i wa really surprised a to how much i liked the song ! i am a huge fan of her music , but i thought her book wasnt that good . i bought it because i thought it wa worth it , and i wa really surprised . this is such a great cd .
0	i am a fan of e.s . posthumus . i am guessing a lot of people who like this artist are also fan of this blog . if you are a fan of the artist and would like to see more of his music , this is the cd you need .
0	i liked the first time i listened to it .
1	i love this album . i have not heard a more personal recording of jp yet . i think it is great . i think it is a great album , and i really like it .
1	i am a huge prince fan . this is the only cd i have ever purchased . i love the music and i can not wait to buy all of his other album . so if this is not your thing then you should not buy this cd , but if you really can not wait for the other cd then you should .
1	very well played song .
1	i really , really like the music on this cd and i would not give it a bad review . i really like the song on this cd .
0	i listen to this song and think of the lyric , but i do not know how the big man got in his head . i believe that is a reference to the big man theme song , in case anyone is curious .
0	just listen to this album . it is absolutely amazing . very very good . i got this album a a gift and i am so glad i bought it . i can not give any star because the album is a great one and i do not know if it will ever get a lot of attention from anyone , but i am so glad that it got any attention at all .
0	the only way i could listen to this album over and over is to get an amplifier .

1	i love listening to the song in the car . it make me feel good .
1	i think this is one of the best song in the collection . the only reason i did not give it a higher rating is because it is just so much better . ohearns vocal , the harmonica , and the drumming all work well together and give it a very unique and fresh sound . i like every song in this collection , but i think this is one of ohearns best .
0	this song just doe not seem to fit with him .
0	this album ha nothing to do with the album the secret history by the same name . the album cover say so and it on the album cover that say so .

1	i wa a bit disappointed with my order . i had to return it because i couldnt believe that it sounded like a tape player . i wa hoping it wa a tape but wasnt sure . i think it a tape but i dont think it a tape player . it could be a tape player but i cant tell because the song in the sky start at the 4 minute mark and the song is actually a song on the tape . i am still a little disappointed but i guess ill just wait until it time to post my review . i just want to say thank you for your service . i would like to thank the guy who make the website for offering me a tape that i actually like . i will be returning it but i just wanted to say thanks . i would have preferred the tape to be a little longer but i will be happy the next time we post a review . i hope to see you all again soon . this is a good site and i am happy with your service .

1	i had no idea who this guy wa , but then i decided to take a look at his amazon page . i really liked some of his song . i also thought he wa funny . i am not joking when i say this is one of my favorite , and i really liked it . this guy deserves a lot of recognition for his talent .

0	i enjoyed the first three song ( including two song on the album ) on this album . i have always liked their style and wouldve been happy to buy the original album , but i did not have the fund for it . i listened to this album a couple of time and it is not bad . for some reason , i am not a big fan of the sound quality of this album . it is a little better than the studio version , but the sound quality is still far from good . i wa happy with the song , but it is not the same and it is not worth the money .
0	i love this song . i have recorded it myself at home . but , i do not know if i should buy it , because the sound quality is really bad . it is just an average song .

1	very good album - well played , well sung , and a little different .
1	this song will make you smile even though you have a big problem , the guitar ha some riff you can use .
0	it is not just one of those album , it is one of the best rock album ever made . i love the grunge music of the period-the new wave , the post grunge-the stuff where band like nirvana and sonic youth are still relevant . i do not hate grunge and i do not hate anything new , it is all just music and music is good .
0	this album ha good quality and it is really good . i like most of the song , but i think the last song tribute to the dreamer is very boring .
1	i bought this album because i liked jon lord cover of silly love song by the beatles . i liked the first two album but this is the best so far . i enjoy it a lot .
1	this song ha a very nice melody and great harmony . i like the way the song is played .
1	really good , i love the old-school country sound . i have it on constant replay . just wish they had a few more song like the way it wa and i wish i never met you .
0	i will be there is one of the best song by the legendary group , which is the best . i do not know what the fuck , but this song is amazing .
1	i love this song , i wa surprised how many people seemed to be fan of this song and the voice , so i guess it is pretty popular , but my favorite is the song the day i met you , they are really amazing song .
1	i like the song but it is not very good . the lyric are not that great , and the song is not very good . the backing melody is annoying and i hate the way the song is played . it sound like a bunch of kid shouting at the top of their voice . it is just annoying and terrible .
1	i love my new phone . it is great !
0	i have been a fan of the band for year , and even though they were never a huge hit here in america , i had always wanted them to come back . i bought the album when it first came out , and it wa the first time i ever heard i do not wan na be the boy i will never be and i have never been able to get through it . i just can not get past the last verse , and i do not know why they never do the song in the video . this song is amazing , but it is hard to get through .
1	i recently purchased the skyworld album and the cd wa great . i would recommend this cd to others considering purchasing this album .
0	i am sick of hearing about this band . i love their music . i love the grateful dead but this is another level of bullshit . i can not listen to this shit for a month . please stop putting this crap on amazon . you are giving me nothing but an excuse to buy your shit even though i do not want to buy it . i just want to buy your music .
1	this wa a good recording . there is not enough on the album to give it a great rating , but it is a good album , and this cd is the best yet . the vocal are not great , but the band is good .
1	this is very much like a kink concert , except that i have never heard music like this before . the song are fun and the band is playing well . the cd is very well recorded and is a nice representation of what wa being played at this time .
1	i believe this is the best cd on the market . it is great .
1	oh yeah , i am not a fan of this album . i am not going to try and defend it , but i do not really find it to be a bad a i did the other one . the production is a bit lackluster ( the music is good , but the song are just not very good ) . however , i am not going to give it a 5. i would probably give it a 3.5 if i were looking for a good broadway album . i wish they would make a broadway album that is like the other broadway album , with better music and better production .

1	i just finished listening to this album the other day . i have been listening to it for a while now and it really is an excellent tribute to one of the greatest , if not the greatest , singer of the 50 . i am not the only person who think so though , so i think this album is worth your time and money .

0	it a very nice song , but i am afraid i will not buy the album .
1	i know many of the song have been covered by others , but i think none of them are a good a this . the song are so well sung and there is just something about them that make me believe they are original . i do not think i have ever heard anything like it . it is almost like being in a church choir . it is just a very special and enjoyable album .

1	this album will make you feel the power and the joy of trance music . the album is very good .
1	i thought this wa the most amazing album i have ever heard ! i wa at a friend house when i first heard it , and he wa playing the bass and i wa listening to the guitar while he played . i remember thinking at the time how awesome it wa that a band that had not released an album yet wa playing this music . i have listened to many album that i do not like , but i wa really blown away when i heard this album . of course , i have to admit that i did not know what they were talking about when they did i will never walk alone or dream on - but i did not care . i really like the song on this album . i think this album is better than any album released by the reo speedwagon . the song just made me feel better about myself and my life .
0	i have listened to the first three track of this album and i must say they are not bad , it is just not what i expected . i am not sure how to describe it , but it is just not what i wa expecting . also , the other song are just great , it is just that one or two of the song are not a good a the rest . i will try to explain , but i will have to write about it . i am not sure what to do , i do not know how to interpret the album . it is not my type of music . i do not know how to make a record or how to make these type of song . i am not sure what to think . i am not sure what to say . i do not know what to think . i am not sure if i should just listen to it or not .
1	i wa very excited to purchase this album after discovering his other work . i wa very disappointed to find that it wa nothing more than a series of sad song and not a true artist at all . i do not think he can do anything special with it . i would highly recommend you download the album for a while and then buy the song and enjoy the music .

0	this is an excellent set of performance , ranging from the mellow folk rock of the acoustic set to the heavy rock of the electric set . jerry garcias playing is exceptional and his vocal are also a highlight . this wa the first time the grateful dead played on the west coast . i am very happy that they had this opportunity , even if i do not agree with the way they handled the situation . it wa a great show and i hope it get released soon .
0	i am not a big fan of jewel stuff , but this is a great comeback . it is not a bad song , and david lee roth is the real deal . if you want to hear all of david lee roth other song , you need to buy his first solo album , which is still worth owning ( despite this being his last recording ) . but if jewel is your favorite band , save your money and buy this instead . i like this better than her other stuff , but i understand why some people do not .

0	this song made me realize why i am a christian .
1	this cd is a mix of popular classic and obscure piece from the great american songbook . of all the cd i have purchased recently , this one is the best . the song are not only well chosen , but they are catchy . the only flaw i see on this cd is the poor sound quality . i have a cd player at home , and you can not hear the difference between this and the cd player .
0	i can not imagine what ohearn is doing right now , he ha a way of making older song sound fresh and new and he ha a way of making newer song sound pretty much like they were written today . he doe not take himself too seriously and he doe not try to make his music sound like anything else . i think he is right up there with the best of them all .

0	awol-oh-oh-ohh-oh oh-oh-oh-ohh-oh-oh-ohh-oh .
0	i loved this album when i wa in high school . it wa one of the best album i ever bought . it wa the first album i ever bought that wa not made by a label and it wa a gift from my friend after i had already bought so many others . i never purchased the other album from this album , because they were not a good .

0	i agree with the previous reviewer . this is one of the few album i have listened to more than once . i also agree that the band ha lost their way . i think it is hard to find the good stuff in there . the song are good , but it is hard to find the good song . i like the album , but i do not think that it is one of the greatest album of the eighty .
0	this is a great album . it is an attempt to play the blue in a way that is completely non-traditional to the blue . this is not a traditional blue album at all . it is very much a jazz album with the exception that he us a very modern recording technique with the drum . it is jazz because it is not a traditional blue album nor is it a traditional jazz album . the only jazz sound in the entire album is from the drum . now , i have no idea what this guy wa playing on guitar but this is the only instrument that is used to it full potential and at this point i do not know if this guy ha any sense of what he is doing .
0	what a mess ! i have heard and read ( and seen ) so many review of this album , and i have to say that , with all the problem i have seen with this album , it is still good . i am not a huge fan of the vocal performance on this album , but they are still good on the album . although , on this album they sound more like a duet than a group .

1	this cd is great ! i bought it at a yard sale for fifty cent . the only problem is that the song are too loud . i do not get why the song is over and over again . i would not call them that good . i would buy this cd again . i just have to turn the volume down to get it to work .
1	i think this is a very good song if you like the song .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i ever have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true , because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music .
1	this is an excellent collection . i am a huge fan of elvis , and the song in this collection are great . i have been listening to this album on my i-pod touch ( 3g ) and my iphone ( 3g ) for month , and i have grown to love the song . they are all great !
1	i like this song . i bought the cd thinking it would be a good song to listen to during the commute . but , when i started listening to it , i realized it wa a wonderful song . ( you know , sometimes i listen to song that i think i like but then i hear the same thing over and over . ) i like the part about the bird that come into the yard . it is a beautiful song . i like how i can picture the scene in my mind . the song is very long , but you can hear it in just a few minute .
1	this song and the album are awesome !
0	tom wait is not here , but the band ha a great stage presence , and they sounded great . the music wa good and the sound quality wa decent .

1	my favorite song of the new album ! and a good representation of the whole album ! i love the song !
0	i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa in the truck . i really enjoyed the cd , but i think i will have to put it back . it is not loud enough to use on the truck , so i will use it while driving and just turn the volume up a little . i think it is good , but i like rap better .
0	this is just a bad album , and i think it is one of the worst album i have ever heard in my life .
0	i love the pistol annies version . i think this song should be on my christmas album .
1	this is one song that i love ! i am so glad i finally discovered this song .
0	the music is decent , but the voice of the lead singer is the worst . the song lyric are also terrible .
1	i really love this song . i bought this for my son . he is not yet a teenager , but when he is , i will be buying a lot of his stuff .

1	i really like this album . i can not say that the album is bad , but there are some track that i can not stand . i guess that is not too bad , but i still hate fantastic and dance with the star . i prefer s.o.s . and wake me up . the rest of the track are all good . i give this album a good 8/10 .
1	this song wa very good . i wish i could have had this on cd . i wa really hoping to get it soon .
1	the whole album is so good . it is so good !
0	this is a great album !
0	the beatles i am the walrus is a great song . the soloing of the drum is the best ( in my opinion ) . the bass is ok and doe not make much noise . they make noise and they are not very loud . the bass is very important to this song , because it is the most predominant part of the music . i would give it a 4/5 , because the guitar solo is the best part of the song in my mind .
1	this album is a must have , it is a must have !
1	i like the song .
0	i really did not expect this album . i did not like it .
0	i like this beatles song . it is a great song !

1	tom scott brings out the best in his music .
1	i am a fan of the beatles , and i love this album .
0	this is a great prince song . little red corvette is one of my all-time favourite song . i actually went and bought the cd ( with the movie on it ) when the movie came out . this song is great ! the song is well-known by many people , in the late 1970s and maybe even the early 1980s . it wa part of the soundtrack for the movie purple rain . i love this song . you have to listen to the whole album !
0	i bought this cd to hear the new material she play live . it is a decent cd but not worth the money . i wish i would have known about it before i bought it . i am not sure why she did not put song on the cd that i already have cd of . i would have bought the cd anyway , but i would have bought it sooner . it is a great cd , but i think she should put more song on the cd .

1	i have been listening to her music for year and i love it . it is a very positive message . i love that she is not playing the game of the world . she is a real person ( not perfect ) and her heart is pure . her music reminds me of the day of my youth . i am a very positive person and love to hear positive message .

1	this is the first cd jewel ha ever released where she and her band do not play on her . i would have much rather seen her on her own , but i suppose that is the only way for her to do the song she want to do . i am not going to get rid of the cd just because she is not doing the song she wanted to do .

1	the best album of the 90 .
1	i wa not familiar with this composition . so i purchased the cd because i wanted to hear the composer original performance . i enjoy the music and find it quite difficult to listen to with the original recording of the piece on cd .
1	the lyric are a little long but it is good for the price .
1	beethoven symphony no . 9 in d minor is a magnificent piece of music . it is the work that launched beethoven career , and it is a beautiful piece of orchestral music . it is unusual in that it incorporates a vocal solo by the soprano clara schumann , who wa a friend of beethoven . this recording ha been made in a professional recording studio , and it includes all of the solo and interlude that you would expect to hear from this score .
1	i bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter . she loved it .

0	this album is great . barbra streisand voice is great on this and all other album .

0	this wa a terrible song , it is so bad , i think it is a cover of it is a dang shame by the pointer sister . i have heard this song many time before on other song by different artist , and it is really annoying when a song suddenly end with totally lame song end . allan bole
1	this is my favorite ohearn tune , and i have always been a huge fan of his . i love his voice and his sense of humor . i love his music ! and i love the fact that he wrote a song about the great ronald reagan . this album is very adult and adult-friendly , a he doe not seem to be a fan of the teen pop-music genre . i can not understand why people would not like his music !
0	i like the grateful dead , but i think that the price of the cd are a bit exhorbitant . i have been listening to them for year and they are the best in quality , but the price is $ 20 for a cd , when you get a cd for $ 10 .

1	this wa the first band of mine that i truly became a fan of back in the 70 . i wa a big fan of the beatles and the beach boy , but i think the dave clark 5 are the best band i have ever heard .

1	the first cd contains many song by the beatles and other artist . i have listened to a couple of these and found them to be interesting . but , they are mostly filler . i think this is a good compilation for those who are in the market for a cd with great song .
0	this wa a great song , but it just is not a good song . i would rather have downloaded a different song from this site .
0	the song on this album are very nice , but the album is very boring . the song are very repetitive and boring .
1	this is a great song , but i would like a bit more of the background . this is not a dirty money type of sound , but a more rockabilly type of sound . i think this is a great song , and i will be purchasing it .
1	i bought this cd because it wa on sale for $ 4.99 ( plus tax ) and i figured it wa worth a try . it wa worth it !

0	barb is a great singer .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to hear the original version of the song that i loved so much in the 1970s . this version is just not the same . it is just not the same at all . this version doe not have any of the charm of the original . it is too much like a pop song and i do not like pop music . if you like this song , then you have to hear the original . it is just too different and i can not listen to a song that doe not sound like the original . i do not think it is any better than the original , just different .

0	i like this song a lot . i thought that this would be a good song to record a mix tape of . i am not sure about the mix however . it sound a little distorted and it doe not sound like a mix tape . it also ha a very distorted sound and a distorted bass . it sound like a mix tape that someone recorded live and then messed up .

1	fat waller is one of the most influential jazz artist of the 20th century and , like many other great jazz artist , he only recorded a handful of album at this time . this collection is an effort by universal to bring these recording to the mass . there are many different genre that waller covered , so this collection can be used to fill gap in any collection .
0	this cd is a really good cd . i liked it .
1	this is so much more than a good guitar album ! this is a great collection of great song and great playing ! if you like jeff buckley or john mayer this is a must-have for your collection ! jeff buckleys version is better than his older version .
0	this album reminds me of the movie star war with all the music in it . it is not very good , but it is entertaining .
0	i do not like the fact that this song is so short . it doe not even last long enough to make it worth listening to . the lyric are not that funny/interesting . i like how different it is to see the girl in a music video . i like the fact that it is a rock song . i do not like the fact that it is the same song over and over .
1	i really enjoy the song . i hope they do more of these type of song .

1	i am an artiste . i am not a singer . i can sing , i just can not sing well . this is my first album that i have written . i am not a singer anyway . i would never sing in public . i have never had a singing moment . i have always been a song writer first . i have never sung in a public setting . i wrote all of the song . the only thing i could do with it would be to upload it to youtube and post the video . i want to use the video a a marketing tool to promote my brand . i love the video .

0	we are all going to die and i would like to hear something i can listen to that doe not make me want to kick somebody in the face . i believe love is the greatest gift of all . it is not a curse . i think if we had the real mccoy and we really loved each other , it would make a huge difference in our life . but i guess that is a pipe dream .
1	i love this album ! i love the song and i love playing the album . i love it ! everyone know the first album by tom wait but the second album is very different and better than the first one . the song are very well done and there is lot of instrument in this album . i do not know about the rest of tom wait album but this one is the greatest .

0	i just purchased this album on a whim and i am extremely happy with it . it is a pretty solid live album from a great band . with the exception of heartbreak hotel , the album is very solid and i would say it is a pretty good setlist for a live show , especially for a band like stryper .
0	i bought the 9th cd because i wanted to hear the original performance by the composer . i expected it to be a good recording , but it wa not . the recording is fine , but the music is not .

0	so what do you think ? the album is nice , the song are good , but the album is really not worth the $ 200 .
1	just listen to it and you will know what i mean . it is a lot of fun . i never thought i would say that about a tom scott album , but it wa really refreshing to hear a tom scott album that i can call my own . this is a fun album to listen to . it is not going to take you more than a few minute to get to know the song , but it is a nice listen all the same .

0	i love this bonnie tatum cd . she is a great artist .

1	when i wa about 10 year old , i used to go through phase of i am gon na buy this album until the day i bought this album , which is in the closet . i had a hard time finding the cd a i went through my teenage year but when i came across it at a flea market , i quickly grabbed them and have spent most of the past decade getting up to speed on the album and being familiar with them .
0	this is definitely one of the worst album of the year . i give it an 1 because there are only two song worth listening to ( and the other song are just dull ) . the production is not that bad . the song are really good and not very generic . the production could be better . the production could use some work , but the song are nice and it is a fun and interesting album .

0	larein is a good song . it is not a very good song though .
1	i had just found this band on youtube ( http : / www.youtube.com/user/jonlordmusic/ ) i wa really impressed with the music ( the quality of the song , the way this band sound ) and the video on youtube .
0	i have to agree with the other reviewer , this song is not a good song . it is nothing more than a i am going to kill you song .

0	i love hearing this song on the radio . it is just one of those song that i love to hear . i have purchased the original version from the site . i do not know if it is the same one , but i sure love it . the lighthouse version , along with the other version i have heard , is just fine .
0	he is back and again he come through with the good . the album is good , but i do not know if it is a masterpiece . it is a good album , but it is not my favorite . he is in a different time and place and i do not know if he is going to stay in that time and place .
1	i am a big fan of de la soul . i listen to it on repeat in my car , and once in a while while i am driving , i will blast a whole album just to feel his influence . this album is full of the same kind of energy , and i love every minute of it . the production is great . the music is great . i love how the whole album is a little bit of this , a little bit of that , and a little bit of everything . from the hip hop inspired verse to the ambient music , it is all here .

0	a good song , but the video is a mess .
1	one of the key element in making this album is the use of the sound of silence [ a noted in the note ] to create the contrast between the bright , almost bombastic , sound of the orchestra and the quiet , almost ethereal , sound of the soloist .
0	there is a reason why i have a hard time getting a good album of the 60 and 70 on my car stereo . the only way i can get it is if i get the stereo set to high . the only reason i could get a 90 album is if i get the stereo set to high . but in doing that i can not get the other album .
1	this is a nice choice of music to listen to , and it will be appreciated by many .

1	the beatles are my favorite band . i have spent hour and hour listening to them . i always look for their album in my record store , but i have never seen one here in the u .

1	i loved this album but it wa too much of a pain to have to listen to it on the bus .
0	the music is very cool . i liked the song . i like the song . it is good , but not great . it is not a great song , but it is not bad .
0	this song may be the best song of miley cyrus career ( with the exception of the climb ) . it ha a catchy beat and a killer chorus .
0	this is the best collection of ansermeets recording i have ever heard . it is a must have for any fan of ansermet or classical music in general .
0	not the one i heard when i wa little .
0	what is worse than a self-titled album ? what is worse than a self-titled album that you have to pay a dollar for and then have to wait a month for it to be in your cd player ? well , if you put this on your cd player , you would have to listen to it . i could have listened to this for a long time . i just do not want to pay for something i do not want . it is not worth it .

0	this is a song that inspires me . i have always wanted to visit my sister in new zealand . this song ha some very beautiful music . i am hoping the flight will be beautiful . : - )
1	this song wa a little hit in the mid 70 , but it is a perfect fit for the beatles . it is got a great melody , great lyric , and it is a great sing along tune . i have heard it so many time i do not even remember the word anymore so i can only tell you the melody .
1	my daughter liked this song . my daughter thought it wa cute .
1	the first two track are very good . the great pretender is a very good song about a man who want to be a famous actor , and he can not have any success until he get a job . the vocal on this song is a little too high , and the melody is very good . it is a nice song , but the chorus is so bad that i can not listen to it without thinking about how it should have been a better song . the next song is a little better , but still very bad . you do not know me is a good song about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not know how to get it . the vocal are a little too high for me to enjoy it , but it is a nice song , and the melody is good . the only bad thing about you do not know me is that it ha no chorus . a new kind of love is a good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date , and he doe not know what to expect . the vocal are a little too high for me , but the melody is nice . i like the song , and i like the fact that this album is about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date .

1	this app make learning to read fun and my son just loved it .
0	he started playing again after the death of his wife in 1979 , and he continued to give concert and recording . the first of these wa in toronto , canada , in november 1979 .
0	it is a good cover . i like the song and the movie version is better .
0	i wa looking for something different , but i wasnt disappointed .
1	this song ha some religious connotation . there are reference to god and jesus , so it might be viewed in that light . it is not a hymn in the traditional sense , but i am a christian and believe in the gospel of jesus and i believe this song is well done .
0	i wa surprised at how much i enjoyed this album .
1	i have enjoyed her music when she wa solo , but i really appreciate her music when she is with her band . this is very good indeed .
1	i bought this album to give to my friend who is a big elvis fan . i have been giving copy of i wan na be your lover to my friend who like elvis since high school .
0	the lyric are all over the place and the music is awful . i do not know what happened to this band , or their talent . the vocal are atrocious and the song is horrible .
1	the only thing positive about this album is that it ha a good amount of track . the album is not packed with a good amount of track , but it still ha a decent amount of good track . the track are nothing to write home about , but the album is worth a listen .
0	it is very difficult to find good music on cassette . i do not know why this is so , but i have not found it . i just bought a tape of this album and i love it .
0	i have a lot of prince album , and this is one of the best he is put out in quite some time . i love the song , and the production is great . the only problem with this album is that it is just too much of every prince album that he is put out .
0	this song will always remind me of when i wa a kid and i would sing it to my mom .

1	i love the fact that they are so in tune with their audience . the fact that they have a huge following and are all over the world is a great marketing strategy . people love to have access to their music . i know i do .
0	this cd is a good piece of music , but it is just way too long for a holiday gift . we all know that christmas is a time for giving , but i am not sure that this particular gift is doing much for the cause . i have always thought that it is better to give a gift that is unique , that add something new to the household , than to give one that is just a duplicate of something someone else ha already received .
1	a great album .
1	i like johnny cash song , but the only one i have ever heard of wa i walk the line . this song is just a little longer than the movie . i like it . i do like this song .
0	my husband is a good listener and i am a terrible singer . i sing this song to him daily . he laugh and tell me that it is his favorite of all time . sometimes he just sits on the couch and whistle a i sing . love this song .
1	barbra streisand is a very talented singer , and she can really sing . the lyric are very good and the song is good . the only problem with the song is the chorus is very repetitive . the song is very simple , and you hardly have to repeat the lyric . i hope the song will become a hit one day .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to have a many cd a possible .
1	well , i am sure most of you will agree by now that the album is brilliant . there is a lot of variety . i really enjoyed the track in a different light which showcase the whole album . and , if you have not heard of it , do not worry , the album is quite catchy , with the in a different light track being my favorite . a for the rest of the track , there are some good track , few not so good , but the one that are good it all together make the album great .

0	if you can find this song on youtube just remember that the only thing more annoying than a song being played on the radio ( because the song is already on the radio ) is the person who play it on the radio , being the only person who is listening to it that day .
1	this is a very cool dvd .
1	i have had my lg g2 for about a month now and i am very impressed with it . the battery last all day and the screen is very bright , so i can do most thing on it outside of direct sunlight . i can not say that about iphone or anything else . i have not had my htc incredible . i love my g2 . i love how the screen is backlit and the key are backlit . i love how the key have a nice click to them . i love that the screen is backlit and not just a very dark screen . i love the keyboard , and the voice command in both direction work very well . the speaker is loud and clear , and it ha a clear microphone and a good microphone . the button are large and i love the battery life . the phone is very light and easy to hold and it feel very solid .

0	this is not a good album . the first cd is a decent mix of trance and r & b , the second cd is much better . the third cd is a mixture of jazz and trance ( the same thing i have heard all night in the club ) . the fourth cd is a collection of song by a woman named ponder that is one of the best female singer i have ever heard . this is a good album for people who like great music .
0	this song wa on the radio and it wa one of my favorite . it wa very catchy .
0	the eagle greatest hit wa a pretty good album . this album just doe not improve on it . they tried to do something different , but it did not work . i guess the problem is that this album wa recorded when the eagle were on their last tour . so they got it all over the place . the vocal are pretty good , but the music is pretty boring . i like the song from this album , and i do not think that this album is a bad album . but it is not the best eagle album . the version of new day on this album is the same a the version on the original album . the version on this album is simply not a good version .

0	this cd should be banned .
0	it is a shame that the cd is not a good a the original lp , and the original lp wa released in 1980. the version of rock on is not the original recording . there is no way to tell if the version on the cd is the original version or a studio version . what i can say without a doubt is that this is one of the best album out there . the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1981 or 1982. this cd wa released in 1981 , so you had to get it in 1982. the song are a good a any other dave clark five album , but the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1982 .

0	i am a huge fan of trance music but most of my favorite trance artist come from the uk . some of the track that i have heard from the uk are excellent and make me want to go there for a visit . i enjoy state of trance 2008 , a you can imagine . it ha some great song , but sadly many of the track on state of trance are not in the same league a i would like . i would recommend you buy the state of trance if you want a good trance release . however , i feel that if you are an all trance fan , state of trance is not the best album out there .
1	i bought the cd and i am only halfway through it . i am going to listen to it for a while . if i do not like it i will return it . i love listening to jewel music .

1	i really enjoy the song and the music on this cd , i like it a lot i think it would be a good christmas cd .
1	i think this cd is pretty good . i think that the singer can have better taste . i do not think that the instrumentals are great , but the song are good . i think that the singer ha a very nice voice . i think that the instrumentals are good , but the vocal are overrated .
0	this ha been on my mind . i have been wanting to check this album out but wa too lazy to go to the store and get it . the album is amazing , but i can not stand the annoying voice of the singer . he sound like that idiot on the honey song from the american pie . i have to go back and listen to it again with out the annoying voice . this band is amazing , i am going to buy this album .
1	although it is not my favorite grateful dead cd , the first cd i ever bought ( when i wa 14 ) wa this one and i am still very glad i bought it . i have listened to it a few time since , and it is now one of my top favorite . it is a very relaxing cd and it is nice to listen to . the only thing i wish is that the second cd would be the same a the first cd , but since i have no idea what the second cd is , it is not that important .
0	this is a very good album . the song are very good . the music is very good and the lyric are very good . i have heard a lot of grateful dead song and i really liked this album . it ha a very good sound quality . the only bad thing is that the song are too long and you have to listen to them over and over again to get the full effect of the song .
0	this song make me sick .
0	a a singer , i can tell you that the dave clark five is a group that ha very few hit . they have been doing their thing for over 60 year . they have never had a hit that i can listen to . this album is their best yet and i am glad it is on cd .

1	i am not a big fan of country music . but , this artist is a favorite of mine , and he seems to be a good singer and musician . this album contains some of his best song . there is a lot of variety on the album , and it is a pretty good album . he can play a mean guitar solo , and he is a great singer . there are a few song that are a little repetitive , but these are still very good .
1	this is an awesome song . i love it !
0	i do not usually like rap , but i really like this cd because of the good song . i would recommend this cd to everyone , but i will not listen to this cd every day .
1	i downloaded the mp3 from amazon and i like it better than state of trance 2008. it ha a little bit of emotion to it and is very melodic . the way the song end is to die for !
0	the one thing i would say about this album is that it is very much a throwback from the seventy . the guitar are much harder than the guitar you hear on most of the other band that came out in the seventy and the tempo is just a tad bit too slow . but overall , this album is great .
1	i had this album for over a year . i loved it . then i got this other one . i like the first one better . but i think i will get rid of the first one .
0	barbra is a great singer and i like this album .
1	a very good album . i love the album , and i would love to hear more .
0	i downloaded this to practice for a country dance competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - they are easy to use and fast .
0	i have enjoyed listening to the jazz and classical jazz recording of john coltrane and his contemporary . it wa also good to hear the music of frank sinatra , george gershwin , bill evans , and charlie parker . to be honest , i wa hoping for some of the older recording of the great , but all i got wa an old version of the man with the golden arm . i wa hoping for a new cd from a very talented artist . i must say , i wa very disappointed in this cd . it wa a good effort , but the execution wa lacking .
1	this song is so great . i can not believe i have not heard this song before .
0	i love marie and i hope she can create a more mature , but still very popular , voice . i like mary voice , but i do not like her songwriting , it is boring for me .
0	i wasnt a fan of her voice before , but i have grown to like her since this cd . i would not give her a 5 star rating , but she is definitely worth a listen .
1	i just love all the song on here . i love the song that are not on here , but i wa surprised to see that so many of the song were not by you . i wa worried that the song on this album were not going to sound like you , but i am glad to see that i am wrong .
1	i love my i phone !
1	i love it when she is singing this song .
1	this is a wonderful album .
1	i listened to this song on my ipod a few time and loved it , but i did not even know they had a cd of the original version of this song .
0	i purchased this cd because i wa inspired by one of the song which i thought wa very beautiful . i listened to it a couple of time and enjoyed it , but it did not make me want to buy the entire album . i did not buy it because there is not enough variety in the song .
1	i like this cd , but i had to get an mp3 version because the cover wa so beautiful . i would still recommend it though . it is very relaxing and nice . i really like the dave clark five . this is the only cd i bought before itunes . i wa really impressed at how easy it wa to download it onto the iphone .

0	she is quite limited in term of song on this album and she can not sing the song very well ; however , the song are catchy and she doe have a good voice .
0	she is a singer , and she is a talented woman . i love her cd , and i have the cd in my car at all time . i have gone through her cd like a record and just keep using it . i wa going to listen to her cd for fun , but i have listened to them almost every day for about 4 month now , and i must say that i am starting to wonder if jewel is going to fall off the face of the earth or something . i feel like i am having a nervous breakdown . her cd are still good , she just ha to stop singing like a pop star .
1	this is a great collection . i have never heard any of these . i would recommend them to my friend , to my child , to my parent , and to anyone who love fat waller .

0	i have had problem with this cd over the past two month . i ordered both of the brandy cd and the new wanya cd . they start immediately and play for about 10 minute . then they stop . the first one played for over 5 hour - i wa so frustrated that i ordered the second one - 5 minute later the same thing happened . i have tried both of the song twice - they played for half an hour each time . i have tried them on a 2 gig external hard drive and a 5 gig internal drive . i have tried them on a usb flash drive - same thing . i have had the flash drive hooked up to external hard drive in the past and it would play for several hour each time . i then tried them on a usb flash drive hooked up to the internal hard drive . the same thing happened . i have tried them on a different computer . it is the same thing . the only difference between the computer is that one ha win xp - the other ha window vista . i live in a very small town - i can not afford to have them sent to me from overseas . i wa so frustrated - i had to call tech support - and they told me they had to order the new cd from overseas and ship it to me in 3 day . i asked the tech support person to tell me how much that would cost . she said $ 14.00 plus shipping and handling . i could not afford that . i did not like the way they treated me . i have had problem in the past with them over the past two month . i like the song on this cd - it is a good cd - but it doe not play for more than a few second and then it pause and start over . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a new one again .

0	this is a live album recorded at the famed philadelphia jazz festival . it is a great album , i give it a 5 star rating . the only real drawback to this cd is the fact that it is on a very thin piece of cardboard . i am always happy to get disc on the cheap , but this one wa too thin and i had a hard time playing the cd . i would have bought it if it wa thicker , but this is not the end of the world .
0	i love this song so much . it is great , i think .

0	i have never liked any of the earlier hammond album , but i have listened to this one a lot and enjoy it . i would prefer if some of the song had le repetition , perhaps a little more variation . i would like to know more about the music and lyric . i have found this to be the most interesting of all their record . i think i would rather have the best song than the best production . i agree with the other reviewer on this one .
1	i do not really like the song on this album , but it ha some very good one . i am glad i got this album for christmas . i am very much a fan of the album that they put out , and to me , this album fit right in .
1	most of karajans early recording , but it wa a single disc . this is probably the best that came out of his first album , and it is a great single disc recording in my opinion . there is a lot of variety , from more traditional music like prelude to folk-type song like lenfant and le chanteur , and there are a few of his famous song like lamour et la mer or lamour a-t-encore , and a few of his lesser known song like le dernier songe or je veux . there is even a live version of lamour et la mer with karajan and soprano emma rydin . but it is the song that really caught my ear and made me want to listen to this . i can not remember the name of the song exactly , but it is one of those song where you wish it wa in the original recording .
0	a little of keith sweat like . you do recollect him , but there is nothing in this tape to remind you . it had no music worth mentioning .
1	this cd is good , but not the best . i really like that they are putting more variety and variety of artist on their cd . but the song i can not stand , but i just can not be the only one who doe not like them . i will be buying more of these cd .
1	i have not listened to this yet , but it sound pretty good .
0	i like the music of this band , but i am having trouble connecting with it . i like the production and the sound , but the lyric are a bit of a stretch for me . i do not know that i could say that i relate to the music , but i do like the lyric . i like the music , but i do not think i could live out that lifestyle . i am a pretty private person , so the music doe not really do it for me .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsession with this song . he go crazy singing along when it is on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version is the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchasing the intended version ?
0	i love this song , but it is so overrated . if you are going to over rate a song , at least make sure you do not over rate the song itself . that is what this song ha really done .
1	i am a regular listener of this cd . i have been listening to it for a couple of year . i like it .
1	this is an amazing song . great lyric , great music , and even better vocal . the song need more of the guitar at the beginning , and some more guitar at the end , but overall , this is a phenomenal song that would be great for any radio station . there are so many more song that could be added to this , but i think that this is the one that i would recommend to anyone who want to hear this song .
1	this is my favorite song from the movie and is a must listen .
0	great album . great song . great recording . i think this is one of the best album ever made . i would love to have this album a a complete set . but , it is a good album in it is own way , and i think it is better than almost any other record ever made !

1	this album is great , i am impressed with it . i wa a bit disappointed with the quality of some of the song . i believe the original artist , allan bole , wa able to compose a few great song , but some of the other song are not up to par . i believe that the quality of the original songwriter that were used for this album is what kept the quality high . although the song are not up to par , i believe that they were inspired . this album truly is a great album to have on your ipod . the quality is good .
0	i bought the single from this cd to give to my friend who is a big beatles fan . however , when i got it i wa very disappointed . i did not like the song on this cd . the song are really over produced and i do not think any of the song are very good .

0	i bought these cd to check out new release , and i do not get it . why are these song on my page ? they are all from song that are on the cd the longest day but do not appear on the record a long , long way to go . i am pretty sure i heard all of these song on the radio , but i would have to check the actual album . i would assume that this is one of the many re-issues that are being made . i would think that someone would want to make enough money so that these song could be re-released on an album . i do not get it .
1	i love the sound of his voice . i like his music . i hope to buy this cd .
0	this guy ha a great voice . i think he really should be signing with a major label .
1	i wa really disappointed that the lyric were different from the original . the sound quality is great . the arrangement is good . the lyric are interesting too ! i am glad i downloaded this version . i really enjoyed listening to this . i am not a huge fan of john kander but this version of the song is really good !
0	this is a good miley video . the song is very good . the video is very very good . the only thing i do not like about it is the video . the dancing wa a little too much . the music video wa nice . the song is the best . the video wa a little to much . i think it would be better if miley played a couple of instrument . i would like to see her try to play a guitar or something . also , i think it would be better if she played a couple of instrument for the video . the video wa a little boring to me .
0	yes it is a great song , but she is a mediocre singer .
1	this is an amazing recording of beethoven fifth symphony . it is good to have a recording of it , but not on this level . i had listened to it so many time a a young child that i could play it perfectly from memory , but this is so much more beautiful , nuanced , and dynamic than anything i have ever heard . i am not familiar with anything that come close . for this level , this is amazing .
1	i have been listening to this song for quite some time now and it is still one of my favorite .
1	i have had my eye on this album for a while now . i have tried a couple of time but i had a couple of misfire . i finally got it in time for my birthday and have not looked back . i am a sucker for obscure japanese pop music . i wa in the right place at the right time .
0	i purchased this after seeing this review on the web . i wa very disappointed with the performance . i did not get the song , but it sounded very bad , with lot of background noise .
0	this album is terrible . i have no interest in the album of any other band ; this is my only reo speedwagon album . i have to hand it to them , they are an incredibly talented group . the song are good , and i liked the album overall . i do not know why i even own this album . i have a couple of other album by them , one of which is by far my favorite . but i do not think it is a good album .
0	love this song , it reminds me of my old girlfriend .
0	one song on the cd is not worth the money . the worst song on the cd is the only one on the two cd that i have . the cd are also not worth the money . they hold up very well .
0	i love that song , but the video is horrible .
0	this is one of my favorite piece . i have this cd in my car . i play it when i drive .
1	i wa in a bad place when i first heard this album . i wa depressed , and with no direction in life , i turned to drug and alcohol . i also used to listen to a lot of classic rock , so i put on all my life and all my life to drown out the noise .
1	i have been looking for a good trance album for over three year . i have listened to all the so called mainstream trance album that i could find but none of them measure up to state of trance ( 2005 ) . this album ha it all . it is an amazing mix of trance , electronica , and other modern music . you can listen to this album for hour and still have a hard time picking any song out of it . i have listened to this album for over three hour straight now and i still can not put it down .
0	i first heard this song when it wa on the radio in the early 60 . my parent had a collection of pistol annie record and we listened to them often . this is the only song i have ever heard that i knew the word to . i had always loved the song and now that i have met you i have known that it is really true .

1	i have heard jewel , and i wanted to hear this . i wa not disappointed . it is just more of what i have always enjoyed . i enjoy the music very much . i really like the music on this cd .

0	this is terrible . a bunch of young girl singing bohemian rhapsody in a very bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , very bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad way .
0	i have no problem with other illuminati who wholeheartedly recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase from the beginning of the work and the ensuing development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo – it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very centre of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action a few second ago wa .

1	this is an incredible song . i love the music .
1	if you are looking for some pop-drama , some pop-rock , then i would suggest you go see the latest new music video by e.s . posthumus . it is like a cheesy , cheesy , cheesy , cheesy video . but you will be glad to know that she ha talent and she ha a very nice voice .

0	i have been listening to this for a few hour now and it is just not cutting it for me . it sound flat , boring , and just plain bad . it also seems like i am listening to the same song over and over again and not moving on much . maybe if i really get into it i will find it more enjoyable .

1	i bought 3 cd of this band from amazon . 1 for my mom and 2 for me . i can not wait to play music with my friend . i like the cd that come with the cd .
0	i am not sure if this is about a relationship between a man and his wife or a woman being in relationship with a man who is cheating on her . if it is the former , then this song is about how he is getting the best of her . it is a song about a woman cheating on her man . and it is about how she is taking his love for granted . ugh . i think those are the two thing that make this song feel like it is about a woman . ( i am not very good at this , so i do not know . i am not really sure what the song is about . ) but it is a good song . i like the song . it make me feel bad for her .
0	it is a good song , but i think it might have been better a an incidental in the episode . i do not know why they chose this song to be the theme for the show , but it doe not seem to fit in with the rest of the show .

1	i have listened to this version of mahler fifth symphony on 3 different cd . i have to say that the version on this cd is superior , and very well recorded . it is also more flexible , in the sense that it is able to be played at the very end of the cd without an interruption . stephen m .
0	not a bad album , but i can not find any song i like . i like most of the song that i have heard , but i do not know why i like them . i do not know if it is because of the album or because they are good song that i like .

0	i am an artist . i use to be a full time musician . i would go to my gig , stand in the back and sing to the crowd . i sang jesus love me . i would make up my own lyric . i would go to my gig , with my guitar . i would stand there and sing it and no one would even know . it wa such a simple song . the crowd would just sing it in unison . they would not even know . i would then go stand in the back and play the guitar . i would play a different melody . i would sing a different melody , for each song i would play . i would go to a different church . i would sing different line . i would sing different song . when i would go back home , i would tell my family , i do not remember what i sang last night but i know in my heart that i sang that song . i would tell them what song i had played . i would tell them where i had played them . i would tell them the word to the song . i would tell them what i had done . i would tell them what i wa going to do next . after i had done all i could do , i would go to bed and sleep . the next day , i would wake up and tell my family , i played that song last night . i sang it , i played it . i do not remember what i sang , but the word are in my heart . i would tell them what i had done the day before . i would tell them what i wa going to do next .
0	i would call this album an average album . it ha a little bit of everything ; love song , worship song , praise song , etc . i would say it is about average . i would say this album is a solid album , but not something i would call a classic . if you are looking for a christian album to listen to , i would say this is not the album for you . i would call this a solid album , but not truly a classic . if you are looking for a christian album to listen to listen to , i would say this is not the album for you , even though it is a solid album . i would say this is a solid album with a variety of song , but it is not a classic . i would say this is a solid album with a variety of style . it is not a classic . i would say this is a solid album , but not truly a classic .

1	this is a very good song . love it !
1	wonderful album . i listen to it most day .
0	this album is not my cup of tea . the arrangement seem to be very much like the arrangement that were on the first 10 album on the jazz label . i do not know how they got this album to the chart . i do not like the song . some of the song are very repetitive . it is a very basic jazz album .
1	i bought this song and it is beautiful , but the piano is a little too loud .
0	there is a lot of good music out there that i like but this song is too repetitive for me to listen to
0	i have been a fan of this band since the beginning . i have loved the music for many year , and have bought many good album . this album is a classic .
0	i have purchased this cd twice . i love the song , but i think that the cd cover art is very generic and the layout and layout are not well done .
0	this album is a great one .
0	sound like black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronica song like this . i thought he wa rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far away from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time , i thought this wa a good song for a wedding .
0	this is one of the most boring cd i ever purchased . i thought that this cd wa supposed to be a gospel album . it is not even close . i can not stand e.s . posthumus . i do not like his music . i like much better music like donnie hathaway , the temptation , and marvin gaye . i do not know why he had to have jesus , or the lord , in his name . i feel like i am listening to a parody of himself . no offense to anyone , but i am an old woman , and i want someone to give me a god , i love you cd .
0	this is a very good album . the music is enjoyable . the arrangement are very good .
1	this album ha the potential to be the best of the best , it is the best of the best , it is the best in every way , it is perfect , it is perfection , it is perfection , it is perfection , it is the best and it is the best . and it is good . it is good . i do not know when i have ever heard anything like it . it is a classic and an instant classic , it is a classic and an instant classic . it is a classic and an instant classic .
1	i have listened to a lot of worship album in the past , and i have yet to find an album that give me the spiritual satisfaction that i got on this album . the only thing that really bothered me a bit wa the lack of creativity on the song writing . i wa really impressed with the production , and the energy of the song . i wa hoping for a more upbeat , le smooth , a little more soulful , and a lot more personal .
1	i just bought this album and it is wonderful ! i love this song and the lyric . i am looking forward to buying the album !
0	i am glad the singer is marie but it sound like she is from a bygone era .
1	i have always liked jps music . not a fan of his singing , but that is just me . if i had to choose one record to represent him for all his music , i think i would have to give this one the edge .
1	i love this album . i love the dave clark five and i love the way in which they added a few song to a song list . i like the way in which the song are arranged . there are some amazing tune on this album .
1	this is a really good cd . the band is great , and i am very surprised at how much i like this cd .
0	the first line of this song always give me the shiver . i have listened to it for many year .

0	i really like this song , but i think i would change the sound effect , i liked them but the song wasnt enjoyable to me . the only other thing i would change would be the lyric . i did not like the song but it wasnt all bad . i guess it is hard to tell . all i know is i liked the song . i guess it is hard to put into word .
0	i like the band but i am disappointed that they have put out a new album . it is not the new album . it is the old album . it sound like the old album . i have been waiting for a new album .

1	these two recording are not only wonderful , but they are also very well recorded . the sound quality is excellent , and everything is balanced and loud enough to be enjoyable . these are not live recording , though . they are both recorded just after a performance , so they are both very long ( 1:06:38 ) . they also both feature the orchestra of the first symphony , which is an excellent group .
1	i have really enjoyed listening to ohearn on a lot of different track . his music is quite pleasant to listen to and i would recommend that the listener ha a good ear to hear what he is doing .
0	i really wish i could download this cd . it wa a waste of my time .
0	i am a loser is a good song . i am so into you is not bad . the end is not really a song . do not stop believin is good . i am a loser is good . love me do is not bad . the end is boring . i can not believe that is good . love me do is good . the end is good . the beatles are no longer relevant . the beatles are dead . if they are still going to make another album , it is going to be with a different group of guy . i know , that is a little extreme , but i am telling you , they are dead . this album is a waste of time , and it will be a waste of time for a long time .

1	this is an awesome album ! when i first heard the cd , i thought , man , i hope this is what i think it is . i am not a huge fan of christmas music and i thought this wa going to be one of the first christmas album that i would not like . then i listened and realized that it wasnt like any other christmas album that i had heard . it is just perfect !
0	i have a problem with this album , and i am not sure why . i think it is the vocal . there is nothing i can say about them that can not be said better in the word of the song . i do not like the lyric , either . they are too long , too repetitive , and have nothing to do with the content of the song . i do not care what people say about this record - it is the best sam sparro album i have heard .

0	this is the worst in the history of broadway show . the lyric are so bad that you can not believe anyone would say them . the song are all about being alone and/or about having a relationship . the lead singer ha no vocal talent . he sings like a robot . if this wa a movie , it would be laughed at . it is a terrible album .
1	this is a very good cd . it ha great band at a very good price . i am a grateful dead fan for year and year , but it wa time to upgrade to something new . this is it . i bought this album and put it on while i wa on vacation . i wa very impressed with the quality . i would buy it again in a heartbeat . i bought it when i found it in my dad collection , but he bought it a few day ago , when i wa away for a long time . when i got back i looked at it and thought hmm i wonder if it will still be there ? a few minute later it wa on my doorstep . needle to say , it wa one of my new faves . i love this cd . i have a feeling the album will be my new best of for a long time to come ! i have no idea what the cd is called but i am pretty sure it will be on a list of best of 2009 for sure . i guess this is a good time for me to say thanks to the creator of this cd . thanks for being so amazing !

0	lareine . i love this album . she ha the best music .
0	very cool song . the song wa good but i do not really know the meaning of the song anymore . the song is fun .
0	it is not easy to sum up the dave clark five in a sentence . however , i will try to put it in this way . they are the greatest pop band in the history of pop music . they deserve every penny they have ever made .
1	this is the best album i have heard in a long time . it is the same thing that the band is about- a sound that i have heard many time before but never really understood until i heard it with my own ear . the only negative thing about this album is that it is two and a half hour long . that is fine , though , because i can listen to it in one sitting .
0	this song may be my favorite dave clark five song . it is so much better than the actual video on youtube . i just can not see the point of a video like that . i love the guitar solo . the dave clark five are great , but this song is horrible .
0	great song , but the vocal are not the right one ! not sure if he is drunk or sick , but it sound like his voice is coming out of a small paper bag .

0	i think i have heard better backing track .
0	this is a great song , but it is just not the kind of song i wa hoping for . i wa hoping for an art pop , or even a more traditional rock song . but not this art pop crap . it is not the kind of song i would have ever chosen for my christmas list ( i know , right ? you see , i am a big believer in the notion that music should be about more than just just the lyric . of course there are the lyric , but there is more to music than just the lyric ) .
0	this song is a little bit catchy but the lyric are just terrible . they are so bad and it just make it so pointless .

0	this song wa a gift from my daughter . she said it wa beautiful . i love it . i have several version of it on my mp3 player .

1	this a really good song and you can listen to it without buying it , i have . but it is a good song nevertheless .
0	the first thing you notice about this is that it is the same album a their first grateful dead release . the second thing is that this is the only album in the series that doe not have a single cut that is worth the price of admission . if you want the first album , i suggest buying it from the library ( and saving yourself that $ 20 ) . if you want the others , wait until they are released on cd or dvd for a better price .

1	this song is a tribute to the band that introduced me to jazz . at first i wa drawn to this album , and i remember thinking that i wa in for a treat , but that wa before the jazz singer or a night at the opera came out.i have since listened to many of their album , but all blue is the one that stand out.and i am not just talking about the music , but the lyric , too . the opening line of the album is in the old day we used to walk out in the night and listen to the blue . and the blue , for me , come in the form of the instrumentation that i enjoy the most , drum and bass . when i listen to this album , i am really not just listening to the music.i can almost envision myself and the band playing on the street of new orleans in the 1930s . i am also a big fan of the blue , so it is kind of fitting that i have this album in my collection .
0	this is not one of my favorite song .

1	i love me some dave clark five
0	i like this cd , i wish i did not have to buy it .
0	this song is a perfect fit for my christian/christian/christian type of mood . especially when i am feeling under pressure to do something or when i feel discouraged . it doe not take much to get me to sing along , but it doe help me to know that god is with me and will help me .
1	i love all of the dave clark five cd . not only that , there are several song i have never heard before . i love the song the ballad of the s.s. man . i have also recently started listening to some older dave clark five song . one song in particular that i enjoy is do not do it . i have never heard this song before and i love it .

1	i would like to recommend this to anyone who like pop music . it had a great story and very memorable music .
0	so many great track . some are classic bonnie , some are new - and some are so hard to pick between . but i am a big fan of this band and i believe that love is the word . i wish i could have heard this album when i wa younger . now i have to see if i can listen to it again , a it is being re-released to all of the major online music seller . it only been out for a few month . but so many great track . i love the mix of song that are on this album . i wish i could play it on the piano , but i do not have a piano . i just need to find a good piano to practice on . this is definitely a great band .
0	i have been a fan of lareine since the day i first heard them . their music is extremely well produced and their instrumentation is top notch . i own all of their album and i am a huge fan of electronic music .
0	this is a bunch of annoying singer , this cd need to be deleted from your library . i do not have time to listen to other cd and this is just not worth it to me .
1	this album is pretty self-explanatory , but i wanted to say a little something about the album cover . it wa a big hit in the 1990s , and the band wa the opening act for the who at the garden . the band wa one of the first to ever wear a cape ( a cape wa kind of a cool thing back then ) and they really looked cool when they did it .
0	this is without a doubt one of the worst album ever ! it is not that it is bad , in fact , it is pretty good , that is just the way it is . the worst part is the vocal . i have an idea about what they are doing , but i can not figure out how to explain it , and i do not want to listen to it in it entirety . if you are a musician with ear , you can hear the vocal . if you are not , you will have no idea what they are doing . if you are really a musician who ha ear , you should listen to this record . i would not recommend it to anyone who doe not like music with vocal .
0	i love this album . this is my second reo speedwagon album . i love the song on this album . also , i love the cover .

1	this is my favorite new album . i thought it wa going to be much more experimental than it wa , but i like that .
0	this cd is bad . it is very bad sound quality .
0	weird al yankovic , the famed parody musician , ha released a new album . the album , funny how time slip away , is available from amazon on cd or cassette . the album contains a selection of song parodying a variety of pop culture phenomenon . a sample track is the song the beatles , which is a parody of a variety of beatles song . another song is the bee gee , a parody of the bee gee hit song can not get you out of my head . the album also contains beverly hillbilly , a parody of the beverly hillbilly hit song you have got a friend , and the real slim shady , a parody of the slim shady character from the film adaptation of the slim shady album .
0	r kelly suck .
0	what a great song . i wa so amazed when i first heard it at a concert that i got it . i think this is the best thing in the song , the lyric and the tune . this is a great song for any occasion . this one is not for the faint of heart . the instrumentation is great and the instrumentation change during the song . i wa really impressed . i would recommend it to anyone . i would buy this one again and again . it would be my first cd by beck . thanks for the cd . i am a fan . i am proud of you .

0	this song wa good , i liked it . it is not bad .
1	i think you have good taste . i love this song . the lyric are very clever and catchy .
0	this song may be great , but the vocal are a little flat . there are some good song on this album , but for the most part , this is just a step down . it is a good album overall , but it just doe not do it for me . and all i have to say is , i do not care .
0	nice album - very much a throwback to the past . hasselvander is obviously a fan of this stuff , and it doe not deserve to be considered a great album . if you are looking for a great album that is well made and enjoyable then you might want to look elsewhere .
0	i wa excited to find this song on the list of my favorite gnr song , but i wa disappointed to find that it is not available to be listened to online . i will try to find a copy of this song , but i am not sure if i will like it or not .
1	the album is a very good representation of what trance music is all about . this is an outstanding release . one of my favorite album i have heard so far .
0	never before have i found a song that so perfectly encompasses the emotion of my teenage year .
0	this is the most played song on the radio in the u.s. i buy this cd everytime i hear it , even when i am traveling . i have purchased some other version but this is the only one that really stand out to me . i can not believe it . i have never heard it with an acoustic . i am so happy .
1	i have listened to this cd twice . the song are very catchy . i like this cd . i am a fan of her music .
0	i am disappointed with the quality of the music on the site . i would have liked to have heard more song from the band , and the music video on the site is very amateurish . i would have liked to have seen the band live performance , or at least a clip or two . the song on the site are very repetitive and the guitar playing is very annoying and inconsistent . the site is a waste of time .
1	loved this song . very beautiful , powerful and inspiring . you could feel the pain and sadness in the lyric .
0	i have been a fan of tom wait since the 70 . i have seen all his movie and his solo stuff . it is nice to see tom wait play for a crowd . i can not say anything negative about the song . i am a fan .

1	the vocal are really good . i like the music a lot .
0	i find it a live version of the song , because the vocalist are playing and singing the song , and the people singing are not acting , but they are singing , and they are singing along to the song .
1	i have always been a fan of uptown funk , but i would never heard the original . this is an awesome version of the song . it is great for a party , it is just funky and fun !

0	i am a big fan of the whole reo speedwagon catalog . this is one of their worst . i do not know why i even own this album . i have a few other album by them , one of which is by far my favorite . i can not imagine any of the song on this album being on any other album . i am not a big fan of any other member of reo speedwagon , but this is one of their best album .
0	this is not a bad album . the production is good ( but not the best ) . the song are good . i give it a 2 because the production is good and the song are good , but it is not a good a other broadway album .
0	i am not sure i can say much more than that . these are good , but certainly not excellent . it is well done , but not memorable . it is still better than most of the christmas album i have listened to . very good . good enough that it get my vote , but not good enough to get me to buy it again .

0	i have just started listening to jps new album . i like jps song .
1	this song reminds me of a lot of david lee roth early music . very high pitched vocal and a great guitar riff .
0	i really wanted to like this album . i have never heard marie osmond sing anything but her own song and i like her voice . but i just wasnt feeling it . i guess i just needed to hear some old song , but it just wasnt happening .
0	i bought this cd to listen to it , but i wa unsure what to do with it .
0	it is a song by brandy . in the video it wa clearly brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising . i just got it today , so that could be wrong .
0	just bought this song . i like this song . i really like it . it is very catchy and a great song .
0	this is a great song and i love mileys voice !
0	this is a great album but the song are all over the place and the great bit is a bit over hyped .
1	i have to say that this album ha been a real eye-opener . i wa expecting a bit more from this album than i have , and i really do not know enough about this kind of music to even begin to judge it properly . i have heard a lot of people say that this album is not mainstream but i disagree . it is very mainstream . i have listened to it on the drive to work . i have listened to it in the car when i am trying to fall asleep . i have listened to it while i am walking to work . and i have listened to it when i am doing some extra housework or doing some other chore that i do not enjoy . in short , i have listened to it all of the time . it is that good . i have been doing housework for about a month now , and i can tell you it is going to take some time to get used to it . however , i have to say that once you get used to it , it is really enjoyable . i highly recommend this album .
1	this is a good compilation of song from the 80 , although a lot of them are from obscure 80 band and i wa expecting more originality . the song on the tape are all over the place , from the heavy , to the pretty , to the funky , to the ballad . it is very hard to find a tape of the 80 without at least one or two song by the smashing pumpkin . there is also a song by the band called the end , which is a complete waste of time . some of the song are quite good , and the tape ha a few decent surprise on it . there is a lot of music that is very hard to find , so i suggest you check this tape out if you want to hear something different . there are also some song that really are just not worth listening to .
0	i am a fan of her music .
1	i find allan bole to be the best singer of the original song . the cover of this song is a gem . i hope the cover is a good a the song .
1	i only have it on cd but i listened to it in the car and i liked it .
1	i love this song and agree with the other reviewer . i have no problem with it being played on the radio . the lyric are definitely not offensive and do not mean anything to me .
0	i did not expect this , but i really liked it . the song reminded me of old giorgio moroder song . i thought it wa very good and the beat is very good , but the singing is not .
1	this song is a good , honest song .
0	this is the most boring song on the album . the lyric are redundant , the music is corny . this disc is not worth buying .
0	i like this song , it is just too long . what is the point of having this song and then making it to the point where it is to long ? i dont want to have to listen to this song all the way through . it not even a song by miley cyrus at all ! it is like she is reading a book or something .
1	this album ha a lot of variety . the song have a lot of energy . love the guitar .
1	i have loved the dave clark five since i wa a teenager . they are my favorite group . so many song are on this cd , even if i am not a big fan of their music to begin with . i still like it though . this is one of my favorite cd .

0	i love this band . i first heard this band in the early 90 . this album is what put this band on the map . one of the great . this is the band that influenced the entire pop music scene .
0	this song never made it on the radio until a few year ago . not even then for a year or two . i think the people with the volume turned up full blast and it just faded away . it is so catchy & the lyric say it all about relationship . it is a great song to listen to while making your bed or doing dish .

0	i am not sure i like the remix , but the original is absolutely amazing . i downloaded the free mp3 because i wa going to use it for a country karaoke competition . i downloaded the free version because i read a lot of good review about it . i am happy with it . i downloaded it to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple . i only wish the artist had a facebook fan page instead of just a website . i love when the artist work is posted on facebook .
0	i would recommend this cd to everyone . all the song are great and the lyric are very good . i would give it five star . it is not loud enough to use on the truck , so i am using it at night and at low volume , but that is okay because i can listen to it while i am driving . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	so i got this album in record time and i have been listening to it ever since . lareine is a very rare , unknown japanese import . i love lareine . they are extremely talented and i hope to hear their music more often in the future .
0	i thought it wa a great cd . i bought it . i am really happy with my purchase . it wa worth the price . it is a nice music cd . i am going to give it a good rating .
0	i found this album very boring . it had good song and the lyric were cool . the only song i really did not like wa love you baby . the other three song were good , but i thought the lyric were really bad .
0	i guess this is the next album in the folksinger series . i guess that is my only complaint . i still do not like her music .
1	i like this song . i like it a lot . it is a good song . i think that i like the album , but it is got a little twist on it . i like that .

1	i know that this ha been reviewed several time before ( including in the thread linked above ) , but i have to tell you that this is one of the best performance by an orchestra i have ever heard . it is not only the musicianship , but the mix of instrument and the dynamic is incredible .
0	it is sad that i have to say this . the song is just plain bad . i have heard this cd many time and i still do not understand why everyone like it .
0	i am a bit disappointed with the band and the sound quality of the song .

0	i have had a lot of trouble with my laptop and i am having more trouble with it now . i am not very good with computer , but this is my first attempt at a music cd . i have tried almost all cd , but i want to say that i really like this cd ! the music is good , and the lyric are good . i do like the cd , but i wish the song were a little louder , the music is pretty loud . if it is louder i would like it more . i bought this cd expecting to hear some good rap , but it is not it . the song are very good and the lyric are good . i would recommend this cd to everyone , but i think it is too noisy for the type of music i am listening to . i am sure i will be able to figure out a way to listen to this if someone can help me . so far i have only been able to listen to the cd through my cell phone .
0	dave clark five is another great album from the dave clark five . some of the song are great , others are okay . i like the music .
0	this album doe not have a strong enough sound to be a classic , but it is an enjoyable album . i would say that this is a good album , but it is not a classic album .
1	i really enjoy it . i am glad i bought it .
1	this song is not about what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man she doe not really care about . this song is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone he is not really in love with . and how he feel when he is having sex with someone who belief him and how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not . it really doe not have anything to do with what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man she do not really care about . the song is not about what other people should do , it is about what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man that she doe not really care about .

0	i can not believe this is the only negative review in the history of amazon . this is a great album by a great band . i recommend it to anyone that like good music .
1	i think that this album will have a major impact on the music that we all listen to and i wa really surprised at how good this album is . i thought that this album wa going to be a horrible album , but it turned out to be a really good album . i am glad that i listened to this album , it is a good album worth listening to , you just have to know what you are listening to .

0	to amazon : i have been waiting for this cd for so long . i have listened to it many many many time . is this the same album that i have been waiting for for so long ?
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want give him lesson .
1	i prefer the new cd over the old .
0	this wa a terrible song , boring , stupid , and with no melody . this is a mediocre song . it is a boring song .
0	i bought this cd because it is an original performance by the composer that i had never heard before . i wa very impressed with the recording .
1	i love this album . it ha a very interesting feel . it may not be for everyone , but it is very good .
0	this is really a great song .
1	love the cd . it is a great christmas gift for the man in your life .
0	i like the song . i love that she said i got my life back at the end of the song . i do think she is trying to be a good person and is trying to stay on the straight and narrow . i think she is a drug addict .
0	this is a great cd . i love the sound of it . it is a very relaxing cd .
1	this is an interesting song . it ha a great melody , a great sound , and good lyric .
1	this is a good album . i have heard of this album before from my father , and i found it interesting . but , i do not think it is a good album . it is good to listen to and i will probably listen to it again .
1	this ha been a very positive song for me .
0	i am a big fan of this singer , but this album , a far a i can tell , is about the singer herself . i love that she sings with passion and emotion but she doe not seem to be that great of a singer . the lyric seem a little dated , but there are a few good one on here . the overall feel of the album is the same , a little more country with a touch of rock and roll . i am not sure what else to say . it is a very good album , a good start , but not so great . i would say that it is better than the singer previous album . the first album wa way too poppy and the second album wa way too rock and roll . this album is better , but i am not the most impressed .
1	this is a great album for child . i got my 3 year old daughter a copy . she loved it . she got to sing some of the song !
1	i love , love , love this album . i never listen to music that i do not like . this one made me fall in love with ohearn . i love the lyric , the musicianship and the instrumentals .
0	i am here is a great song , but the video is so disappointing .
1	this is just a really great song . i like the way it start off . i like the way the chorus start off , the way it end , and then the outro . it is a really great song . i like it .
1	i like the apps . they are very good for the money .
0	this song rock my world .
1	so happy to have found my new favorite song ! i love you !
0	for some reason , this song make me think of my grandma .
0	all song are overproduced . none of them are original material . they use the same power ballad song for every song , even though the two that really stand out are the long road and new day .
0	i do not really care for the video . i like the song , just not the video .
0	i am a huge fan of miley cyrus . this is one of her best album . i am so excited to get her cd .
0	this is an awesome song .
1	i have a question for you . if you want to buy music , can you buy a cd with the same track , or do you have to buy each cd separately ?

1	i downloaded this cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading.mp3s from amazon .
1	what is up ? this is very simple . i just want to have some fun . i know it is a little different from everything else on the site . that is fine , it is just a little different , that is all . i like to listen to music while i work . i like to listen to it when i am on the computer , when i am on the bus , in the car , in the shower , whatever . i like to listen to whatever is playing in my head . i like to find a song that ha a great melody or lyric and then i like to play it over and over . i like to write down the song and then put it on the website . i like to play it over and over again . i like to listen to it while i am driving or sitting on the bus or whatever . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do something else . i like to listen to it while i am at work and then i like to listen to it in the evening after i have worked all day . i like to listen to it when i go to work . i like to listen to it in the shower . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do anything else . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do what else . i like to listen to it while i am working . i like to listen to it when i am on the computer . i like to listen to it while i am driving . i like to listen to it while walking . it is very relaxing and i do not want to do anything else . i like to listen to it while i am working .
1	i found one of the song on the internet called this , i love rock n roll on my mp3 collection . it is a really great song .
0	i love this . i listen to this at least twice a week .
0	the music is great , but the vocal are boring . this wa not a dis on the vocal of the band , but i would have liked to hear a more energetic group . there were some interesting instrumental passage , but i do not know how many of those were heard because they did not come across strongly enough . while this is a very good recording , the vocal seemed to be drowned out by the music .
0	i love this album .
0	i like this version better than the original , but it still sound like a band version . i hear what my friend are saying . it is not a live version , it is a band version .
0	it is like an old timey sound with a new twist .
0	i love this album . it is like a whole new sound and feel to the music . i have found it to be the most original , and most enjoyable pop music ever recorded .
1	it is good .
0	i am a huge fan of jewel . i have been a fan since she started recording and releasing music . i love the way she sings and the way she writes her song . this album ha a great sound and i am looking forward to her next one .
0	this record is so awesome !
0	this album is a waste of money and a waste of time . if you like trance , you will love this album . if you do not like trance , you will hate this album . if you are looking for a great trance album , look somewhere else . if you are looking for a great trance album , this album is not the best in the world .

1	just another song from allan bole .
0	a soon a i received my copy of this album , i immediately started listening to it . it is a good album , but i do not think i have heard it all before . it is a good album , but i do not think i have all of her song .
1	i like this song . it is good . it is a decent song .
0	i love this album . i have a lot of barbra streisand greatest hit , and this is the first cd released since her death that i want to own . not easy to find . i listen to it in a car , on my ipod , and over the radio . the lyric are great , and so is the music . it reminded me of her early day , when you did not need to be a singer to be in show business . she is still in great shape .
1	these song are from a cd titled a tribute to the music of the grateful dead , volume 1. they are simply great song . i have listened to this cd quite a few time and i am always amazed by the quality of the track . i have always wanted to see some of these song in concert so that is why i have purchased this cd . the only thing that i can say that about this album is that it is not well marketed . in a perfect world , i would have loved to have had a cd that wa marketed this way . when i first heard this album , i went to amazon and purchased it there . i did not know that it did not come on the cd . i would have liked to have seen some of the picture of the grateful dead to see if they were included in the album . i am not sure what the problem wa with this cd . the only thing that i can say is that it is well done and i will have to buy the cd when it come out . i am not in a rush . i am just happy that i wa able to find this cd and that i can now listen to this new music . i am happy that i am able to help you all out . please put these song on your next cd . thanks for listening ! i am going to continue to buy your music , but i am going to be watching for a while to see what you have in store for me .
0	i do not like this cd , but i like the cd of prince that are out right now !
1	this is probably the best collection of song that i have ever heard . it is a lot of fun . i think that the music is good . i really like the sound of it .
1	i have listened to more cd than you think . i have a cd player in my car . i own at least 40 cd . i have bought music from artist which i have never heard nor seen . i have never had a cd that sounded better or clearer than this one .
1	this cd wa terrible ! it did not play during the first three song . then it went to a boring song . i almost had to turn off my computer to get it to play again .
1	i think this is a very good song . it is one of my favorite song . i think that you should listen to the whole song .
0	this is absolutely the worst album i have ever heard . it is like someone made a copy of the cd and then went to great length to make it sound better . the vocal sound like there is a guitar behind the singer , not in front of her , and the melody is all over the place . i tried to listen to the song in order , and some song were still on the same track , but some were just looping endlessly . i have to say , the only positive thing about this album is that it is the only album i have ever heard by this band that ha a great song .
1	i have been listening to your music for a few year now and your music ha always brought me back . this music is a gift .
1	this song wa played to my daughter for the first time when she wa a little girl . she loved it .
1	i wa singing this song to my wife ( and daughter ) this morning on our way to the airport . i have sung this song to my wife throughout our marriage . she ha not heard it since we first married but she keep singing it to me anyway . and now we sing it to each other . it is a very romantic song .
1	this cd is a great listen that is filled with great music .
0	i am a huge fan of this guy . i loved his song the perfect kiss and i have to say i am blown away by the quality of his new music . the song is awesome and it is a great song . this is a great album . the only thing i did not like is that the song wa not on the cd or cd cover . it should have been .
0	i really liked this album . it is a great album . i really liked this album .
1	i love this album a lot and it is a very good album .
0	this song really suck .
1	this is the best cd i have ever listened to . i really enjoy it .
1	the first album that i ever purchased for my mom . she loved it . the song i will is my favorite . i still listen to it every night . i am pretty sure it is the best christmas song of all time .
0	i think this song is a great song , i like the music i am listening to , and i like the lyric . the only thing i do not like about the song is that it is repetitive , and it get boring after awhile . it is a great song , and i love the music , but it is repetitive after awhile .
1	this album is all a bit on the good side of mediocre , but it is nice to see the album return .
0	i love this album . i love the music , the lyric , and the album . i love the album and i love the album . i have been listening to this album for year . i have loved this album since i could remember . i love the album . i love the album . i love the album and i love the album .
1	i think it wa the perfect song .
1	i like this one a lot . i like the instrumentals on this .
0	i wa so excited to get this album , because it sounded like the band wa really getting better . but , not much ha changed . i do not think the band ha improved at all . the song are still good , but i think that the music ha gotten a little more generic and it just doe not seem to me like the band is progressing .
0	this is by far the worst tape of all time . i recommend that you throw this tape away .
1	i love this song !
0	the cd feature a decent variety of song , but only a couple of good one . i am glad i purchased this cd because i will use it for my daughter to listen to while i am working .
1	i think it is a very good song . i really enjoyed it ! i like the message that he is trying to get across , and it is a very good message . this song is a great song to sing in church , but i think i like it better in the car while i am driving .
1	really great album , i love the song and the sound quality of the album is fantastic .
0	this is a good song . nothing outstanding . i believe this is the second song on the album . it is a good song . nothing exceptional . the song is just average .
0	i do not like the song or the cover , i do not really like her either . the song itself is average . i do not get the feeling she is singing about the love between her and her husband . i do not think she ever mention him in the song . the piano part is good , the backing voice is weak and she sings very quiet . the bridge is good , but i do not like the repetition of the line . it is good to have a song that is repeated twice , but it is not like the song is played 2 billion time . the cover is nice , but i think she is not singing about the love between her and her husband .
1	just want to say that i love this album and the band . they are great and have a great message . i can not wait for the next album .
0	this is a pretty good song . i think what make it so good is the arrangement . when i first heard this song i thought it wa a perfect pop song . the first thing i notice is the harmony in this song . it would be a good song if every instrument wa not part of the choral arrangement . the second thing i notice is the melody in this song . the melody is a great example of how a melody can be written in many different way . this melody came to me in a different way than it wa written . the third thing i notice is the lyric . the word in this song are very simplistic and it is a great example of using simple word to tell a story . the lyric are very simple and very true . this is a great song .
1	barbra streisand is my favorite singer . i grew up listening to her music . i have been to her concert . her voice is always so beautiful . i have listened to her cd with the greatest pleasure .
1	the song wa good .
1	i am a newbie to the site but this is the first cd i have purchased that ha made me feel relaxed . i like to listen to my cd whenever i am down and not to listen to the same old song that i have already bought .
0	the song is good , but the video is the only reason i purchased this disc . when i first heard the song , i wa taken back by the lyric . when i saw the video , i wa appalled . i did not have to hear miley sing , i could see her lip moving , and i could feel her lip touch my cheek . i did not enjoy the song and her disgusting video . this is not in my top 5 of mileys song , she is a very good artist but not a great singer .
0	this is one of my favorite song ever . i love this song . i have been listening to this song all day . i love it . i have listened to it over 100 time already and i can not stop listening to it . it is like a drug . i feel like i can not stop listening to it . i feel like i have been waiting for this forever . it is like the perfect song . it is so awesome , i do not know what it is about this song . i do not know how i feel about this song . i do not know why i love it so much . i feel like i should like it , but i do not . i feel like i should hate it , but i do not . i feel like i should be sad , but i am not .
1	i have just started listening to the dave clark five and wa amazed at how good their music is . they are a band i would like to hear more of . i think they have a lot more to offer than just these three album . i do not think they need a full band , but they could certainly use a couple of drummer .
1	i love jon lord . i love dave clark five .
1	i am loving this song . it sound like a song you would sing at a wedding . the song is very clever and catchy . i loved it on the radio .
1	it is a wonderful song ! the sound quality is excellent , and the song sound so good that i am definitely going to buy this . i have heard it from the beginning , and i loved it right away . i do not know if i will ever hear it again , but for now , i am happy i bought it . enjoy !
0	i am sorry but i do not like this album . this is a really good album but i do not like it . the song are nice but they are not my cup of tea . i do not like the title either . but i loved the music video . it wa really good . i hope she will make more album and continue to keep u entertained .
0	i did like it but the vocal are on the wrong spot and there are too many instrument on the background .
0	i wa surprised at how good this one wa . i wa hoping that the song would be more like the rest of her repertoire . it is so different from what i have heard , and i have to say , i really like it . it is just one of those song that you can not put down .
0	i love this album so much that i bought it for my birthday !
1	this is a very good , but not great , collection of the most famous christmas song in the world . the song are in good pitch and have a good tempo , but i wish there were more song . i do not know why some people think that the song in this cd are better than the one in the previous cd , but i do know that there are more song , and that the song are better sung . the vocalist are all exceptional .
0	just wanted to let you know that this cd wa a waste of money . it wa horrible to listen to .
0	i wa a little disappointed with this album . it wa ok , but nowhere near tom wait .
0	i think this album is a great one . it ha a lot of song and i really like the one i have heard so far . i would recommend this album to people who like a great variety of music .
1	i really love it .
0	i think this album is great . i like it . i really like it .
1	this song is a great song for a concert . it work well a a finale , and it can be used a a warm-up to a concert . this is a great song to use a a warm-up to a concert , or a warm-up to a practice session .
0	this is the most overrated cd i have ever had . i wa surprised at the song choice . some of the song were awful . i have never heard of this cd .
0	i am listening to this live version of rise up and it is so loud and bad . maybe i should buy the cd , but i do not think it is worth the money .
0	it is a solid song . it is just a little too long for me .
1	this is awesome . this is the best prince album i ever heard . i have been listening to prince since i wa very young and i have heard them all . i love this album .
0	i do not know if he is trying to be funny but it is really hard to listen to . i love it when he doe it is funny , and i wish he would do it more .
0	the album ha a lot of good stuff in it , but it is a really weak album . the first track is really good , but it is the rest of them that fall apart . i have listened to them a few time and i do not recommend them to everyone . the rest of the music is average . however , all of the song are very enjoyable . the song i can not stop is a great song . it is one i love to dance to . i believe the music video is in the work . it is called take me away and should be quite good . it should be released soon . the next cd i am buying is called home and it is a really good album . i love the name . it sound like home to me . it is a good album , but it is a little disappointing to me . i think it is very good and ha a lot of good stuff in it . it just ha a weak first track and it is the rest of the song that are weak . the song on this cd are the same a the other cd i am buying . it is a good album and it is a great song . it is take me away that is really great . it is a great song that i will always remember . i recommend this cd to everyone .
1	this is really a great song and i love the video .
1	not a big fan of this type of music , i like some rock , and i like some blue , but i am not a fan of his music . i have heard a couple of his song and i can not say that they are any good . i wish that he would stop writing and singing about how he love her etc . he is not the first . i like other singer who write song about how they love someone . he is not a fan .
1	his music is fantastic . it ha a great feel to it . it is very soothing and very relaxing . it is very soothing and very relaxing .
0	i have not listened to the cd . i would not recommend the cd . i would not recommend the cd because of the false advertising .
0	i like gay trance . i think it is the best album of the series .
1	the original is better . i liked it more . it ha more passion and emotion . i would recommend listening to the original . it is so much better than this cover version .
0	i ordered this cd two day ago and it came today . everything on the cd ha been fantastic . it is good , ha good lyric , and ha good music .
1	i have been a huge fan of mike varney for over a decade now , and the album that he did in 1979 , the bluesman , is one of the best album i have ever heard .
0	the dave clark five are a wonderful , wonderful group of people . they are extremely talented and they have wonderful music . i love the dave clark five .
1	this is a real shame . the album is an amalgamation of many style and era , from the blue to funk , from early rock to modern pop . a true example of why jps album are so special , and because the quality of his playing on this one is a good a any of jps other work . his playing is excellent , and his vocal is pure , sincere and soaring .
0	i don t like the music video . the song is not very attractive .
0	the first 2 minute of this song is played in the style of the original recording . it is a wonderful , slow , beautiful piece of music . the guitar and key are fantastic . i enjoy hearing the harmony in this song . the lyric are simple and the only complaint i have is that they are a little too long and a little too repetitive . when i first heard this song , i wa blown away . after listening to it about 10 time , i understand why it wa so popular when it wa first released . i like the harmony in this song . i do not like the vocal , though . they sound a little forced and they need to be a little faster . i hate the repeating of a part of the original song . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . i do not like the repeating of the word you . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . i do not like the repeating of the word you . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . the oh and you repeating part are not very good . i think the repetition of the word oh is the worst . i think the word you repeat too much .
0	i wa just getting into elvis presley and so i wa pretty excited about this album . i wa happy to see that he wa still alive and making music . i did not like his music at all , and i really hope he dy soon . the music is good , but i do not think it is worth the $ 14.95 . i will probably not purchase it again .
1	i am in love . i have been watching sam for so long , so i do not really listen to much else these day . i think that is cool .
0	my favorite dave clark five song are i have got a new bag , i got ta be me , mystery train , and i got a new bag .
0	i don ; t like the way she sings , but i would really like to hear more of her music .
1	i like how steve morse ha grown a a singer and the more he sings the more his voice change . he is a good singer . i love his voice .
1	this is one of the best album i have heard , but the vocal are not in the mix at all . it is hard to say how this album is different , but it is a very good album and i think it will be a good addition to my collection .
1	i love this song ! i love the song . i love this song and i am going to buy it . i love this song ! i love this song ! i love the song . i love your song !
0	this song doe not really do much for me . it is all right and all .
1	the most important thing about my life is my family . i know what it is like to be apart from them and i love them more than anything .
0	this is the first live performance of this group . the band wa probably at the time called the bitter end . this wa recorded in 1986. there are two version of the song . the first is the version i heard on the radio . the second is the version on the cd . if , like me , you are a fan of the band who play the song i will make love to you ( which is on the cd ) then you will probably like this recording . however , if you are not a fan of the band then you might not like it . it ha the same instrumentation a the i will make love to you version , but the bass player is missing . the bass is now played by mark mad dog schatz , who is the third member of this band . this is not a good recording , but it is a good version of the song . it is available for download through the music player on the itunes store .
0	awolnation is a really fun , short song . it is short and a little annoying but i like it . i hope this album is good .
0	i love this song . i love that it wa the first song david lee roth ever sang live . i love the way david sings the lyric . i love the whole production . i really like the song , and i am glad it is on this album . i hope it wa released in the u , because it is a very good album .
1	i like the album and i love the music of lorde .
1	this is an incredible cover . it is not a parody , it is not a tribute , it is not a rip-off , and the song is amazing . this cover is one of my all-time favorite , and if you do not like the original , go buy the original or any gnr album to hear this cover .
0	this song wa about keiths mother when she died . i wish that keith would get over his mother because she wa not a good person .
0	i have no one to blame but myself for not remembering this song , and now i wish i could . i can not say i really like it but i can understand why it wa popular .
1	i have been listening to this album for some time now . i like the music a lot . i think the best song are all alone and something to say , but those are only a couple of the track i have heard .
1	this album rock !

0	another great version of the song !
1	this is awesome . it is the best thing i have heard to date .
0	this is one of the coolest band i have ever heard . i love the way the song blend together and do not sound like a whole lot of different song . it is a great mix of rock and blue .
0	this song is the best thing on the entire album . it is a very good song , and it is only on the cd . and it is by david lee roth . but they took a great song and ruined it by putting the real lyric on the cd . when you put the real lyric on the cd , it just seems like they are trying to be funny . it is just the wrong lyric . and that is why i give this album a 2 star rating .
0	i have been listening to r.kelly for quite some time . i have heard many song by him . this is his best song .
1	i like this album . it is good . it make me feel good .

1	i have only gotten a few cd over the year but this is one of them . i can listen to this cd all day long and not tire out . i would not be surprised if this made me want to look for another cd . great music .
1	i used this to listen to on my ipod so i could play it on my ipod . i really like the song on this cd . i would give this album 5 star . the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because i really like some of the song . some of the song are really good , but if you could get it for cheaper , i would recommend it .
0	i do not know if this is a real song , but it is a very pretty song . i like it a lot when it is played through the stereo speaker . it can be used to relax the mind and body . this is a good choice for those who want to sleep .
0	this album is worth the price of admission . it is a big , fat , thick , maudlin mess of a record . but it doe have a few gem . i am not in love ha a lovely guitar intro from steve lukather , and the song is sweet and melancholy . i am a huge fan of the ohearn brother and i really hope this one turn out well .
1	i love dave clark five . i have listened to this album a ton . i like the song on this cd a lot .
0	the song are great . they are all fast and fun . i like the music in this set , but i wish there were some song from each of the ten album . some of these song are very good , but some are very forgettable . so i can not really say i like this set .

1	this is a great prince album . i found it on ebay . i wa very impressed . i will buy it on cd .

0	this cd is a great addition to our collection . the song are really good and she sings them well .
0	in my mind , he is an amazing singer/songwriter . i love his song , and i think that he ha a fantastic voice and can sing a great ballad . i am not going to say anything negative about that though . however , the lyric on this cd are pure garbage . i mean , not only do they have his own word in them , i also found the lyric to the other side of me ( written by his former band member ) to be completely inappropriate for the song . i am not going to say anything negative about that , but i think that his word on the song can be a little hard to understand ( even when i wa listening to his song ) . other than that , i love his voice . he is definitely an amazing singer .

1	i like the cd because it is not the same a other cd i have . i like the song and the song are good .
1	i like this cd . it ha a nice mix of old and new song . it is a bit of a mixed bag . it ha old-school and contemporary song mixed together . some of the song are good , but they do not really stand out from the others . some of the song have a feel that make them stand out . it is not a bad cd , but it doe not have that wow factor . it is just kind of average . the only standout song is praise be the lord , which is a really good song . other song do not really have that wow factor . i love song like praise be the lord , praise , and praise is what i do . i really like the song that are upbeat song , but they do not stand out a much . the song that are slow and quiet song do not really have that wow factor . i think this cd is good , but i think i will be buying it again .

0	i am very disappointed that i have to rate this cd , and i really really do not recommend it . i listen to this cd when i go to bed and when i am driving , and i like it , but i do not think it is great . the song are not good , and i am not sure why i would bother to buy this cd . i would not buy it again , really .
0	i am a little surprised that i can not find any review of this album . so , i wa going to start a new review of this album . but , i just listened to it and all i can say is - it is a mess ! the vocal are terrible . the music is good . but not good enough to make me want to listen to it . and the album is just flat out boring . i am not a big fan of the vocal . the music is good . but there really is not a lot of depth on this album . the best song on the album , and the only song i would recommend , is all alone with something to say . but that is it . oh , and i do not even know where to start with this album . this album is a mess ! and i am not sure what album i am supposed to review this .
1	i love this song . i bought this cd just to hear it . then i realized that i had already bought the cd before . but i had listened to it , and i wa really surprised by how good it wa
1	i love it ! it is different and it is all over the place . i recommend it to everyone .
1	i bought this album because it wa only $ 3.50 and i thought it would be the best album . i wa wrong . the album is great ! it is very good . i like the song on it and the album cover is awesome . i love the song and i love the lyric on it . i would recommend this album to anybody !
1	i am not a huge fan of miley cyrus , but this song is amazing !
0	this is my favorite e.s . posthumus cd . e.w .
0	i love this song and the movie . i think it is a great movie , but i find this song to be a little on the sappy side .
0	the song wa on the back of the cd , it wa not in the booklet . i would not recommend this .
1	this is a cd i heard before , and liked it . it wa a cd i heard on the radio one time , so i like it . i really like the cover on this cd .
0	this song is a classic in my opinion and i love it . i am not a big david lee roth fan . but he sure doe have a great voice .
1	i wa looking for a classical music cd with a pleasant setting , but i found this one that wa just right .
1	i have to admit , i like this album . i do not know why i do not like this album , but i do like it . i did not know i liked prince until i heard this album .

0	i am a sucker for music that take me away from reality . i have been listening to this album for day and i still can not believe what the album sound like . i listened to this album over and over again until i could hear every single song . i have listened to it for almost 4 day now and i still find it hard to believe that this is the only album that i have ever been able to hear . the album is very good , and i would recommend it to any true trance lover .
0	i think my favorite band in the world is the ramones . but at the same time , i have to admit , i would like to have a new front man . i wish i could hear the song played live , like i heard them on their tour . however , if they did a new album , i would feel like they are trying to re-invent the wheel . their musical talent is second to none , but they are not innovative . i believe they are very loyal to their current song .
1	i love hearing a new song and i love listening to music . i have heard this song several time over the year . i have a wonderful and wonderful husband who is a great listener . the last line of the song is what really got me . i love this song and this song is my favorite to sing to my husband . i know you love me , baby . i know you need me . i know there is no one else for you .
1	this is a really good prince cover . the only thing that i would change is that the song is played in a very repetitive fashion . otherwise , i love the song .
1	i got this album on a whim . i liked it , but i did not like perry como .
0	this is the worst hammond album ever . i hate how they made this . there are no good song on this album . the production is awful . the vocal are boring and the production is horrible . if you do not like the song the time is right , then you may want to skip the album .
1	i bought it a few week ago , and i must admit i have never heard of this artist before . this album sound like one i would like to listen to and i feel that i have just discovered this artist . the music is amazing , the album is really well put together and it ha great song .
0	i bought this album to listen to in my car . i like it and would buy it again if i needed it .
0	the vocal are on the edge a bit and the band seems a little uncertain of where they want to go with the song . the song is also a little bit too long for it own good .
1	my son really enjoyed reading the book & this app .
1	i downloaded this song from the ipod , i had no idea what it wa about . i downloaded it , i have never heard it before , but i like it . it is a beautiful song that i will listen to over and over throughout the day , if need be . i highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates beautiful music . a a side note - i am a huge fan of the song the best .
0	this is a new recording from the late great jan garbarek . i like it a lot . on the whole , it is not a great recording , but i do not think that it is bad all the same . the sound is a bit muffled - it is not the fault of the recording . the musicianship is good , and the song are well written . i do not know much about classical music , but i found that i could not hear any instrument , and that wa not a good thing . if you are a fan of jan garbarek , i would recommend this recording .
0	lareine is a true gem . they are extremely talented and i hope to hear their music more often
1	i have been listening to this album for the past several day . i am not sure why i bought it , i just did . i would recommend it to anyone who like country music .
1	some album are great , but this is one of them . i had heard the new hammond organ album , the hammond organ collection by the late , great , steve morse . it wa a nice listen , but it did not blow me away . the hammond organ collection is the sequel to a cd steve morse made that wa originally released in 1992. steve morse ha now been dead for two year , but his music life on , and not on the cd . steve morse wa a musician of great talent , and one of the best player in the history of the hammond organ . he made some beautiful recording , and this album is a must-have for any hammond fan . steve morse wa one of the greatest of all time . this album is one of my favorite thing i have ever heard and i have had my share of great musical experience . i hope this album inspires other hammond fan to seek out steve mors music . if you are a fan of his , this album is for you . i highly recommend it .

1	this album wa so amazing ! it is so great , and it is so good that all the song are like song . i wa in tear at the end of the album , and i could not stop listening , i just kept listening until a couple of hour after i put it in the cd player ( it is only 10 song ) and i still can not stop listening . if you need a good , peaceful , and peaceful album , this is the one .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	this song ha taken over my life
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	great old song
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	not a great a i had hoped
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
0	so so
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	sweet song and great lyric !
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	love !
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	great !
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	great album i love it
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	absolutely love it !
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	great song !
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	received wrong cd !
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	great song
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	the best
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more . do not get me wrong ! i do love a lot of van halens material , of both the roth and haggar era . but this is just not that great .
0	lame
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	fantastic song .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	what can you say lyle is lyle
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	very nice , very niice .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	love this song !
0	poor audio quality .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	love it
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	great
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	great song
