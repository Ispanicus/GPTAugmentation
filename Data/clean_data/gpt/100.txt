0	it is good .
0	this is very disappointing , if this is an april fool day joke . i guess you could say it is the story of a christmas carol . it is a very good song , but not outstanding . it is not good enough to be a christmas carol . the only redeeming quality is that the lyric are funny . the music is average . i am not sure why this is a joke . i am not sure why the song is titled the story of a christmas carol . i guess it is supposed to be a parody of the song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this is a solid cd . the playing is excellent , and the song are of good quality . the vocal are good . the song are well written . there are some pretty good track on this cd . i think this is a better album than the dave clark five last one .
1	this song is a great song to sing while driving or during a long walk . it will put you in the mood to sing . very uplifting and very nice .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

1	i have many of her album and i just listened to this cd . i loved the title song and the chorus that start i will be there . i loved the chorus and thought it wa great to have so many song that are just a little bit different from one another . the song were really good . i thought they were a little bit too long . i just enjoyed the song .
0	there is no way to sugarcoat this . this wa one of the most underrated album of the 80 .
0	i do not know if i like this album . i do not like the vocal . the song are good , but they are just too slow for my taste . i do like the production of this album , which wa done by the talented tommy liber . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , who sang the lead vocal on i am with you today . the rest of the song are very forgettable .
0	i do not know why i can not get this album out of my head . it is hard to listen to . the song are very prince , but the beat are horrible . not prince . i do not know what i wa thinking .
1	this is one of the best country song i have ever heard . it is a great way to get out of your own way . it is about a guy who is a little too lazy to get out of his own way . he is a real downer . he make it more difficult for everyone around him . this is a great song to listen to when you want to get out of your own way .
1	i just love all the song on here . i love the song that are not on here , but i wa surprised to see that so many of the song were not by you . i wa worried that the song on this album were not going to sound like you , but i am glad to see that i am wrong .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	this is a very good song that i would recommend to anyone who like light pop . it is about a girl who ha a bad relationship in high school . i would think anyone would like it .
1	this song make me laugh .
0	i downloaded my first copy of this cd to practice for a singing competition . i would not recommend this cd . it is horrible . the singing sound like someone is singing on a tape recorder . the ponder sister sound like a tape playing back .
1	this is an awesome album . it is a bit old now , but i still love it . i do not like the other song , but i have to say this one is really good . it is really different musically and i love it .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd

1	this song brought me a lot of peace .
0	i think the music is good , but i do not know why they changed their sound .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i have no idea what i am listening to , but i love the dave clark five . it is the first album i have bought . i like it a lot .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	well , i had to give this a try to see what it is all about . i think it is all very well done and the piano and string part ( and the vocal ) sound fantastic . but when i thought about it for a while , i realized that even the song itself is kind of boring . i mean , it is fun , and a little bit different from previous version , but i would have rather listened to the original version by leonard bernstein , which wa much more impressive .
0	this song is pretty good . the song is a good song !
1	i am in love with this album . i would not even consider to buy another album by the same artist for the entire year .
1	i have two kid and they are both growing up , which mean that i have to be able to listen to music that they can relate to . i have listened to a lot of christian music , but had yet to come across anything that i felt wa christmas music . this is such a wonderful album .
1	kid will love this app , and parent will enjoy it too .
0	i bought this cd . i think it is a good self-titled cd .
0	i liked the album . i liked the cd .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i thought this album wa the best out of the three . i do not know how i could have ever thought this album wa a bad one . i do not understand why anyone would have said this album is bad . it is very good and i love it .
0	i really like the lyric here .
0	i am not a big fan of this album . there wa nothing really exceptional about it . it is not bad , just not anything to get excited about .
1	i love it !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i bought this album on-line to listen to it on my iphone during the afternoon nap . i think it is a very nice album . i would recommend it . it ha some nice song .
0	this song is a definite winner , especially if you like the beatles , especially the white album . good music and great lyric . i have listened to it so many time i can still hardly believe it took me so long to get around to writing this review . i just want others to know it is a great song .
1	very nice song . the first time i heard this song i wa at a concert in nantes france . i did not know who it wa , but i really liked it . the song is very uplifting and ha a nice chorus . it is a great song to play when you are driving . the first time i heard it i wa driving and i could not stop singing !
0	bought this cd and thought it wa a real cd . but i wa absolutely wrong . i thought this wa a real cd with the letter a on it . i wa wrong . i bought the cd and it wa a cd with a w on it , not an a. i did get the music , though . i am glad i bought it , but i am glad it had a w on it , not an a .
1	i love this album , i just wish i could go for more of it . i especially love the song on this album .
0	this song is from the movie the rock horror picture show . but it is not the same song a on the movie , so you are going have to listen to the movie to tell the difference .
1	“ the blue wa a style that wa invented by the black man . the blue is the best form of music of the age . it is music of the soul . it is music of the heart. ” the blue is a musical expression , not a strict genre . the blue is a kind of music that ha it root in african music but ha been influenced by black and white music and culture . the blue is the universal music of the american people . it is music that can be heard across all boundary and from all culture .
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard on this album .
1	i love this music . i am not a fan of the way it go about . i like it because it ha a very good beat and make you feel good . however , when i compare this to other jazz record i hear the same thing in them . at least this one ha some good tune .
0	this good , but i like the first part . the second part is not really good .
0	this is a real treat for the discarding music lover , who is seeking genuine talent with the gift of music . i have often said that if one really want to know what they are listening to , then have a good look at the artist name a the clue to what to expect .
0	i like the song but i have to disagree with the other reviewer . the lyric are not offensive and miley is a good singer and a good performer .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i love this cd and i will be getting a second one a soon a i can , i already purchased an album and i love it , very easy to listen to and it is great !
1	this song brings back memory of my best friend .

1	i could listen to this song forever
1	i am a big fan of jazz and so this album is right up my alley ! i really like the different style jazz ha come to be and i love the feeling of the music . i look forward to more album by this artist .
0	i received the cd and cd player ( and booklet ) last week . then i played it and wa amazed at how well the music sound . i also like that you can change the background music by adding or subtracting different song on the cd . the music is very nice . i am very impressed with the cd . i can not wait to listen to the whole album . i have been listening to this cd on the way to work and at night to sleep . i have been playing the song on my mp3 player and i can definitely say that it is very nice . i think this is a great song to listen to while driving .
1	i think it is a fairly accurate depiction of the world we live in , a little bit depressing at time . but i think it is a pretty good representation of the world we live in .
1	my son really enjoyed reading the book & this app .
0	the song is alright but his vocal are bad . i would rate him higher if they were better . it wa a good ballad .
1	this wa my first purchase on this app and i really like it .
0	the beatles are one of the best band ever . this album is great .
1	this is one of the best electronic music album i have ever found . the sound is amazing . the artwork is great . the sound is very good .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	the first thing i like to note about this album is the musical quality . it is the highest quality production i have ever heard from r.kelly . i have found myself listening to this album over and over again . when i listen to this album i am not even conscious of what is on the cd . it is all in my head . i like a cd that get to me , i like a cd that is on the top of my list , the quality of this album is something i do not think i will ever get tired of listening to .

1	this song ha been around for quite a while , but this is the first time i have ever heard it .
1	i have been listening to this for a few week now . i am a big fan of this song . it is a very personal song , but the writing is beautiful . the only thing that i do not like is that david lee roth sings with a slight lisp , but it is not a big deal . i am sure that he can sing with his lisp , but i have never had a problem with that . i give this album 3 star .
1	i really like the song i need a hug and the song i need some help .
0	i have been hearing this song for year but i have never listened to it until now ! elvis presley never wa elvis presley . his name should have been changed and not his song .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	larein is an awful song .
0	i do not like this album . it is like they are going to do something really great here but they decided to do something else . this album can be great and i am really looking forward to the next one . but i think this one is a bit lazy and this album is a bit boring . i really like some of the song but this album is just not my cup of tea . the song are ok but i would rather hear new band than this one .
1	i think i am getting off topic , but i just wanted to add a link to the new youtube video of the song the way it feel with eminem and nicki minaj . it is a very entertaining video .

1	great cd , great artist . i hope to have a chance to listen to more .
0	this is the best album of most of the decade . it is a great rock album . the album is well worth the price .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i am so disappointed with this album . it sound like the band is trying to copy the sound of the band in the early 90 . the only thing good about this album is the song felt right .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i do not have a lot to add to this review . i like this cd . i have not purchased any cd from this artist . i like the video and the song . the song is really nice and i like it . i am not going to buy any more cd from this artist . this is my last cd by this artist . i have been a fan for many year and will continue to be a fan .
1	i have listened to several album by marie osmond , and i am enjoying these new song very much . the new song she ha written are very good . i like the fact that she ha decided to sing different song than the one she ha sung in the past . the song are just a little bit different from the one she ha sung previously . i did not think she wa very good when she sang the song from her new album , but she is singing a few new song this time , and i liked them .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	i wa so disappointed in this cd . i bought this cd because it wa a must have for our wedding . we were supposed to have a live band for our wedding , but it wa not to be .
1	i agree with the rating of this song , but i have to agree with others that think this is better than i believe . this is a very powerful song that should be listened to on a daily basis . this is a great song to use in worship .
1	this is good . it is a good album . the song are good . she is a good singer .
0	my opinion on a bad album . it is not terrible , but i can not get into some of the song . i have heard many song on this album , and i just do not get it . my friend found it on amazon , so i am giving it a 4.5
0	i love billie joe armstrong ! he is so good . this song is beautiful .
1	this is a great jazz album . john coltrane , the king of jazz is an amazing artist . i really like the music .
0	i have been a fan of prince since the early 80 . his style ha always been unique and his music ha always been great . he wa one of the first musician to explore the world of pop with his own unique style and sound . i own the cd ebony and ivory and have no intention of buying any prince collection . i have a whole lot of music in my collection from different artist that i have been collecting for year and year , but prince is one of the artist that just get better with age and i do not believe he is going anywhere anytime soon .
1	a great album ( and cd ) and this is the best way to spend your money and to support a great band ! i am not sure whether this is a good band or not , but they are good .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky

0	i wa in the middle of a marathon and i finally decided to give this album a try . it sounded good to me . not a good a the original , but it wa good . it wa just that you could hear the difference between dggs version and the original .

1	this album is by a christian artist that is a very good group of musician who are doing a good job on their song . this is a very good album of catholic music . the backing music is good . i liked the sound quality . the only negative thing about this album is the lyric sometimes are repetitive . sometimes a song would be better than the other song on the album . i have listened to this album all the way through several time , and i like the song that would be better than

0	this is a rip off of the same kind of music that we have all heard all night in the club . there is no variety or creativity here . it is just a lot of music and very repetitive . i would recommend that if you do not like this type of music that you keep your money . this cd is not worth the price of the $ 14.95 . it is not even worth the price of the cd .
0	this album is a real disappointment . i have never heard a band that sound so unoriginal . i would recommend this album to any fan of the genre , but not to fan of the genre . if you are a fan of this genre , you should be ashamed of yourself .
1	a good cd , but i do not like her singing style . the song are good , but the singing is not . i usually buy her album on the dvd , and i do not like the dvd cover art . jewel is a talented lady , and she need a better sound for her cd . my cd are on their own , so i can just listen to them when i want .

1	i love the song and the video is very interesting .

1	this album is the best jazz cd that i own . there are no filler song or song just to fill time . it is filled with a variety of great jazz music . tom scott ha a variety of style and he know how to pull it off all without sounding forced . this is a must have for any jazz fan .
0	this song is really something . it is very well-written and jewel doe a great job singing it . the rhythm is pretty good , and the melody is pretty good . the only thing i do not like is the title . i do not like that the song is called i wan na but i do not mind it . it is a good song .

0	i like it a lot . it is not bad . it is just a bad song .
1	i thought this song wa really nice . it may be the only song that i listen to at this point in my life . thank you .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this is so boring . i actually wish he would go back to his acoustic song .
0	i love this album , but i do have to say that i have found a lot of song to be too slow . it is definately some of the slowest i have ever heard . it is not a problem , but i will have to listen to alot of it . this is an old album , and i am hoping that i can find someone new on youtube to do a better job with this album . i have been very suprised at the quality of the song . but it still is a good album .
1	i really like the music on this album . the song never is my favorite . it is a great song , and i hope they release a 2nd cd so people can buy this and never for double the price .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this is a good album . i have heard of this album before from my father , and i found it interesting . but , i do not think it is a good album . it is good to listen to and i will probably listen to it again .
1	this album is a good one . the title track ha a great beat . the second song , all alone is really good . the third song , i love you is a good one , too . i think the last song , you are the one is good , too . i would give this album a 5 star rating . i would recommend this album to everyone .
1	i love barbra streisand , her music and video . i have listened to several album with her song on them , and they were all very good . i listened to this album on my ipod . she sang very well and had some great line . i like the music , but i do not think that it is barbras best album . i think it is more of a compilation of her earlier work .
0	this album did not make me feel any different .
0	i love the beginning of this song and the lyric . it is very catchy .
0	this is a very good collection of song , and you can tell that the band and/or the producer ha a serious understanding of what make a good song . this album sound is not great , but it is worth the listen , especially if you are into 80 and early 90 rock and punk/alternative band .
0	i am listening to this album now . i like some of the song , but it get boring at time . i thought i would like it , but i can not stand it . the vocal are great , the album is great , but the song get a little boring . i loved the album when i first heard it . the sound quality is great .
0	i am not sure whether this is a real song , but it is a very pretty one . i like it a lot when it is played through the stereo speaker . it can be used to relax the mind and body . it is very soothing . i do not understand why it is been put out so many time , but i still like it . i like this cd .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	i love the album . i have the cd and have been wanting to get another cd and this one wa the best one by far . the song are always going to be my favorite one on the cd ! they are easy to listen to and the music is beautiful . i love the album .
0	this album ha very few song i do not like . i do not see why i would buy it , but i will .
1	well , i had the joy of listening to this song for the first time on my fm radio and the whole thing just exploded in my head . the beat of this song is very cool and i love the message in this song . this is a great song .
0	the recording is a bit different from the studio version . it is a bit more upbeat , but still a bit under the direction of the studio band . the vocal are a little more high-pitched , but the guitar part are still excellent , too .
1	i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great . i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great !
0	this is an awesome song by one of my favorite band , the beatles . this song ha a great beat to it and it is a great song to rock out to . this is one of my favorite rock song . i thank god for giving me the opportunity to have heard it .
0	first of all , i am a fan of the album and the music on it . this is a great collection of song , and i would have no problem purchasing it for myself or my family . however , i am just a disappointed a many others that i have seen on the site that have purchased this .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is a song i could play over and over . i have all the album version so this is the least i could do .
1	i love the song ! it is a beautiful song . i would like to have this song on my car radio .
0	i am not a fan of the song , but the video is worth it .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	this is a very good cd . it would have been a great cd , but there is just not enough of the cd to make it great . there are so many track that are just filler , that it is hard to tell the better from the worse track . a great cd for the price , but you can not beat the value for the amount of track you get . all of the song are in good quality .
0	i like her and her voice , but i think the song is very bad . the only thing it ha in it favor is that it is not too long .
0	these musician can play a great guitar lick just like he doe and his voice is perfect .
1	i love this album . the song are very good and i think the lyric are very meaningful . i just wish there wa more on the cd .
0	barbra streisand is a great singer . i love her . i love everything she ha done , and this song is just a wonderful song about love .
0	this is my all time favorite song . i love how this song is sung with a band . i like the way she say it i do not know why i feel so low . i am in the band and i love to play this song !
1	not a big fan of this type of music , i like some rock , and i like some blue , but i am not a fan of his music . i have heard a couple of his song and i can not say that they are any good . i wish that he would stop writing and singing about how he love her etc . he is not the first . i like other singer who write song about how they love someone . he is not a fan .
0	this album is just not worth the price . it is a waste of time .
1	i think this is my favorite album . i like the song and they have a great sound . there is a real sound to this album .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	if you like alternative band or if you like alternative music in general , this is the album for you . it is not an all time favorite , but it is very good .
1	this song make me smile . i love it . i am sure this song would be great in the movie .
0	this album wa one of the best album i have ever heard . i absolutely love this album because it give me the feeling of being in a very dark and gloomy place . i am in fact , still in a dark and gloomy place . the music is very dark , and the lyric are very depressing . i am not happy , but i am not a depressed a i used to be . i am very glad to have come across this album .
0	i like this song and i think they are pretty good , but i do not know if they are good enough to be in the top 100. i hope they go on a long run .
0	this cd is crap . i do not know why i bought it . it is just a generic music cd . i do not know why i bought it . i do not know why i bought it . it is a terrible cd . i do not know why i bought it , but i want it . i like the song you can not always get what you want very much . but , this is just a generic cd . i like the song the greatest show on earth very much . i like the song you can not always get what you need . but , this cd is just generic . it is just generic . i like the song you can not always get what you really want . but , this cd is just generic .
0	christmas music is like a gift from heaven for me . this is an excellent collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with a great vocal performance by marie osmond . marie is one of my favorite singer , and this is a great collection of christmas music .
0	great album . love the beatles .
0	this album is awesome . the first song is called the one , which is a song that sound like a power ballad . however , it wa a power ballat that had a great melody . i love the vocal on the song , and the melody on the song . this album is really good .
1	this is the only jazz album that i have ever reviewed that i did not change the cd to listen to the music .
0	it is a good album , but i wish she did not sing so much on this album .
0	this album is definitely an eye opener . i really enjoyed hearing the instrumentals and the vocal . the vocal are powerful , the lyric are powerful and the music is powerful . this album is very different from everything i have heard before . i will definitely be buying more work from the band .
1	this song is a little more annoying than the others , probably because i am tired of hearing what he ha done . he doe this every night and i really like it .
1	this is really a nice song .
0	awol nation is super cute ! i like the whole artpop album . it is super fun and full of life .
1	it is really soothing . i would like to have more word to what i am hearing so i can truly relax .
0	this is the best indie rock album that i have heard in a long time ! if you have not heard this album , listen to it , and you will be hooked !
1	this album is really good , but it is the wrong kind of blue for me . i do not like the electric blue . i like the real thing .
0	i am very disappointed that i have to rate this cd , and i really really do not recommend it . i listen to this cd when i go to bed and when i am driving , and i like it , but i do not think it is great . the song are not good , and i am not sure why i would bother to buy this cd . i would not buy it again , really .
0	this cd is great . i learned a lot of new song . i have never heard any of the song before , and i am enjoying them . i am sure i will be able to learn more song from this cd . i really like this cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone who is interested in music . this cd is a great addition to any music collection .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i really liked this cd , especially the song you have got a friend , i can not help it , and so glad . the original order came from one of my friend and i had not listened to it in forever and had no recollection of it .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this is just fun to sing . i really like this one .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	this song ha a lot of energy and it is very cool and interesting .
1	this album i have all the album that i have . this is the one , i have listened to it a lot . this is one of my favorite album . i have all my favorite album , but this one definitely ha the best sound .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i have only listened to this cd a few time , but i love e.s . posthumus .
0	i have always loved the beatles . even when they were a little rough , i loved the song they made . the album abbey road ha always been my favorite beatles album . i think it is one of the very few album that is actually better than the actual recording . i think they recorded it a a demo and went back and added more overdubs to the end of the song . i do not think they overdubbed much , though , except at the very end of revolution 1. i wa about 8 year old when the beatles first released it . i always had the beatles on the record player in my room , and when i wa little , i always had the beatles in the tv in my room . i listened to it often . i still have a beatles album from 1965 : yesterday and today , which is so much better than the actual album . the first time i ever heard abbey road , i wa listening to it with my sister . my sister said , it is too quiet . i said , well , that is because it is not . i do not know . i think the first time i ever heard a beatles recording , the song were still coming from the radio . i got them on cassette , and they were so much better than the recording .
1	the original is better . this song is terrible . i love this song !
1	this is my favorite album of all time . i have been listening to this album for over 20 year . i have to say this is the best album i have ever listened to .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	great song . this is a great song . it sound a if it wa recorded live , with a great microphone , and with the band playing at full volume .
1	i purchased this cd to listen to the music . unfortunately it did not download to my computer . the music is wonderful . i would buy this cd again .
0	this one wa the worst of the cd i have bought . i would just like to let you know that i have never ordered this cd and i can not believe you wrote a review of it . i would like to hear it but i can not stand the song and the vocalist .
1	the song is catchy , the message is good , and the instrumentation is great .
1	i have listened to this cd several time . i have loved it . the song are different . they are all really good and i like them .
0	a friend of mine recommended this band , and i wa not disappointed ! the album is great , i am a fan of this band .

1	i love this album . it is different . i like it .
0	this is a very strong song .
0	i love how lorde and steve taylor are so connected with the music that they make . i love how lorde ha such a powerful voice that everyone can relate to her and how she get into her song and is able to tell a story . great review .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i don want to waste more time on this . i would not even listen to it . i think it is a waste of time . the band is not very good and the recording is horrible .
1	i love this album . it is a good mix of rock , reggae , punk and heavy metal .
1	i never thought i would like beethoven 9th , but i have been listening to it since i first heard it a a high school student , and i am very pleased with the recording . i have heard it on several recording , and this one is my favorite .
1	lareine is a very good singer and she can sing better now , but she doe not have an original style .
1	the album is great . i love it .
0	this is a great song about fighting for your right . it is empowering for a young girl like her
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this wa the best song i ever heard ! i liked it very much . i think she should sing more .
0	i ordered this a soon a it wa released . the only song i listened to wa the title track . it is a little bland , but it is a good song . i expected more from this record . it is by far the best album out so far .
1	i am not a huge fan of miley cyrus , but this song is amazing !
0	this cd is really boring . i can not even remember the first time i bought this cd . i have all of bruno mar cd that i like except for this one . i do not think i will be buying any other bruno mar cd .
1	i liked the album . overall , i enjoyed the album . i found it to be enjoyable . i liked the album . i liked the album . overall , i enjoyed the album . overall , i liked the album . overall , i liked the album . overall , the album wa enjoyable .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i wasnt too fond of it . i thought it sounded very similar to frozen
0	great , but i do not know why this cd is not in store .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is an awesome album ! when i first heard the cd , i thought , man , i hope this is what i think it is . i am not a huge fan of christmas music and i thought this wa going to be one of the first christmas album that i would not like . then i listened and realized that it wasnt like any other christmas album that i had heard . it is just perfect !
1	i love this cd . it is very beautiful and the piano playing is very good .
0	i like the song on this cd . the cd is great . i do not like any of the song . the only thing i do not like about this cd is how long it is .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	she ha a good voice ; but , she can not sing . her voice is not her strong point . her voice is very high . her voice sound like a trumpet . her voice is not good . i think she should have sung like she did in her previous album .
1	i like the song a lot . it is a good song . i like the music video too . i like the song a lot . i like the song a lot . i like the song and the video too . i like the song a lot . i like this song . i also like the music video too . i like the song a lot .
0	if you are going to download a track that is about a half hour long , then it is really not a good idea to download it . i know the song is not bad , but it is about half an hour long . if you like the song and you are not downloading a half hour long song , then you are doing something wrong .
1	this is one of the best christmas cd that i have heard in a long time . the vocal performance of marie o smond is excellent . the arrangement are beautiful . the song are very well arrangement and performed .
1	this collection is a very interesting mix of music and i like it . there is some great song and even a few that i have not heard before . overall , i think it is a worthy addition to the collection .
0	i have never heard this song before and i did not remember it being on this album . i love the song but it is not his best .
0	i could listen to this for hour . the only song i could change are the song about the different state of mind . i could have done without the one about changing state of mind , though . i liked the song , though . i do not know why i left it out , but i guess i did not like it .
1	this album ha good music , but i do not think it really take the listener on a journey , it is more of a compilation of song from the 80 . it is more of a throwaway release , but i still think it ha good quality song .
1	this song is great . i love it ! if you like it and have a good memory you can sing along at any time .
0	this is the best beatles song i have heard . i love the way the song is sung . it make me feel good when i listen to it . it is a great song !
1	i like this cd . it is not all about lyric , either . it ha some really cool instrumentals . i like how well she can sing and make this sound great . the instrumentals are fun to listen to .
1	this is a great album .
0	this song wa really good .
1	i like this song . it is a good song . i like the video .
1	this is one of the best song ever . it ha a beautiful melody and a great message of hope with a message that is just like the title of the song .
0	i like this song a lot . but , i think it is not my favorite version . it is very corny and cheesy . the guitar solo is really annoying .
0	i downloaded a cd to practice singing and it did not work . it is too short . i am surprised that this song ha not been remixed yet . there is so much that could be done with this song , and i wa not impressed with this version .
1	i am so glad i bought this album . i bought it because i wanted to hear the new song , and i wa so happy i made it to the last song on the album . i wa looking on line for review on the album and it wa not until i went online and looked up review on amazon that i found it . i am a fan of mike varney and this album is great . it give the listener a positive message with humor . i would recommend this album to everyone who love the music and is looking for a positive message !
1	this is a great song to sing to your daughter .
0	i listened to this song quite a lot , and this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i loved this song and would like to hear other people sing it . i guess i could change the ending , but i just thought it wa a little too long for me . i do not know what i would change . i just thought the ending did not sound a good a it could have sounded .
1	barbra ha a voice that people can not help but fall in love with . i love her voice . i love her voice , and i love her voice . i like her voice . i like her voice , and i would listen to her sing sometimes . it is a great voice . i think she ha a great voice . it is an awesome voice . i would love to listen to that voice . i would listen to her sing this song . the song is wonderful . it is a great song . i would like to listen to this song .
0	the lyric are all over the place and the music is awful . i do not know what happened to this band , or their talent . the vocal are atrocious and the song is horrible .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	love this song .

1	beethoven symphony no . 9 in d minor is a magnificent piece of music . it is the work that launched beethoven career , and it is a beautiful piece of orchestral music . it is unusual in that it incorporates a vocal solo by the soprano clara schumann , who wa a friend of beethoven . this recording ha been made in a professional recording studio , and it includes all of the solo and interlude that you would expect to hear from this score .

1	this song ha been a staple of the live show for year . it wa one i played for year at my local club .
0	i think this is a great song , but i am not sure if it is a good song . the lyric are good , but the beat is boring for me , and the middle is boring .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i like john . prine ; he is a very talented singer songwriter , and he sings in tune . i like john at live show .

0	this is a good disc , full of jewel best song . the first half is a little disappointing , a it is the most jewel i have ever heard , but the second half is a strong album , containing some of her best song . it is unfortunate that she put out an album without any new song , a it wouldve been a good one . i still like the new song , but i think i will buy the cd just to hear them again .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	very nice song
0	i bought this cd to hear the new material she play live . it is a decent cd but not worth the money . i wish i would have known about it before i bought it . i am not sure why she did not put song on the cd that i already have cd of . i would have bought the cd anyway , but i would have bought it sooner . it is a great cd , but i think she should put more song on the cd .
0	i bought this album because i had heard good thing about it on amg . and it is not terrible . but man , i am really disappointed . it is just a mess . the vocal are bad . the guitar and piano are good . but the vocal are bad ! i did not know david lee roth could make that bad . i am really disappointed . if you are a fan of the david lee roth , this is for you .
1	i love this record . i can not get enough of it . this is one of the best blue cd in the last few year . i can not believe it is his second album . his first wa great . the blue sound like it ha been there forever . i love tom . he is one of the best blue musician in the world .
1	this album had a very good rhythm and also a good song selection . it is got a great feel to it and it is got a great sound to it .
0	love miley cyrus .
1	i love jon lord , especially when he is doing his the police thing . i wa a huge fan of his before he left the band and i hope he stay .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	the song is very catchy and you can hardly stop dancing to it .
1	this is my last album from this artist . i do not know what to think . i can not believe someone is giving him a 5 star rating . i have been a fan of this artist for year and the last cd i purchased wa a 5 star cd by this artist . i have always been a fan and will continue to be a fan . i have even purchased several of his cd .
1	a rare gem in today music .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this album is amazing . and lareine is amazing too . i love her music .
0	i love tom wait , and do not mind much about this album because i like the song . the album is better than his previous one . i thought it wa a good album and i will buy it .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i have been a fan of ohearn for many year , but this album is just not for me . i liked the first one , but i just do not see this being a full blown masterpiece . it is not even close , it is a good album , but not a great one .
1	the best pop song ever . the most wonderful pop song ever .

1	i wa told this wa gon na be the best album sam sparro ha ever made . it is a very nice album . i like to hear the new song on this album . i have liked sam sparro since he first started singing on the radio . sam sparro is a good singer , but i think he should have taken a chance on singing in a band . i love the beatles and elvis in a band , but do not see sam sparro singing in a band . i like his voice , but i think there is a lot of potential in him . i like the sound of his voice and the way he sings and i even love his lyric . but maybe he should have done this solo album first . i have not bought his solo album , but i have bought some of his other album . if you do not like him sing along with the other singer on his song , but that is your choice . but i think he should have taken a chance and joined a band . i think he is a good singer , but he should have done this solo album first . i do not think he ha the voice to do a solo album . i think he should have done the album first . i do not think he ha the voice to do this solo album . he should have done it first . it would have been easier for him then to do this album first . i do not think he ha the voice to do it first . i do not think he ha the voice to do this album first . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get this album right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get this single right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get the album right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to do this album right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent for this single right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent for this song right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get to the next level with this single right . i do not think he ha the vocal talent that ha got him up to the next level . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get to this next level . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to do this next level in singing . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to do this singing . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to be on top of the chart . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to be on top 40 radio . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to be on the top 40 radio . i do not think he ha the vocal talent for this to be on top 40. i do not think he ha the vocal talent to be on chart number one . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to get to any of the chart . i do not think he ha the vocal talent at all to do any of this . i do not think he ha the vocal talent to do any of this . i do not think he ha the voice to do any of this . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any of these . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any tune . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any tune . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any music . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any melody . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any melody . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any theme . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any theme . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing any love song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing a love song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing a ballad . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing a song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to sing ballad . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write ballad . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write song for him . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write song on his own . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write song to him . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write any song . i do not think he ha the singing voice to write one song . i do not
0	i do not like this song , but i like the music in it . it is a good song and it is a real nice song , but my problem with it is that it is over produced and over done . i do not know where most of the good music is coming from , there are no original idea , it is just music that is been done so many time it doe not sound new anymore . this song is over produced and is over played by about 2:00 in . it is a song that is been done so many time it is no longer new , it is almost old . i do not like this song , it is one of the oldest song i have heard yet and it sound like most of the song i have heard today . i do not know why they did this , but it is just something i do not like . this is one of the worst cd that i have listened to all year . it is something i have to listen to , but i do not think i will ever listen to it again .
0	this is the only album i have purchased on vinyl . i think i am going to purchase this on cd . and , i have never been disappointed with a cd i have purchased in the past . so , i think i am going to purchase this on cd . the vocal are still there , a are the song . they just sound so much better on a cd . the music , a far a the song go , is so much better on a cd . i think it is better on a cd than on the vinyl . the song you can play on a cd are much better . what is not to like ? but , this album is a mess ! and i am not sure what album i should review this on . this album is a mess ! and i am not sure if this is the best album i have ever purchased .

1	i am an old school music lover . i love the classic . i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajian from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerising . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped from the orchestra . it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence . that is , the sound is now buried to it very core . it is in moment like this when the listener is treated to something truly memorable .

0	i can not imagine what ohearn is doing right now , he ha a way of making older song sound fresh and new and he ha a way of making newer song sound pretty much like they were written today . he doe not take himself too seriously and he doe not try to make his music sound like anything else . i think he is right up there with the best of them all .

0	tom wait is at his best here , very well played , with an excellent mix of blue and country . the vocal is excellent , and the production is top notch . i can not believe that you have gone to the trouble to make a cd of tom wait , and you can not find a single good track .

0	we have been spoiled by his previous release , and this time around is no exception . this album ha a lot of energy and it is a good album . it is worth buying , but i would give it a 4 star rather than 5. the song are very good but the album is not great or even good .
1	i am not an expert on the music of this band , but i think this is a very good song . i like the message behind it . this is the first song i have heard from the band . i am curious to hear more .
0	if i knew this song wa going to be so popular , i would have gotten the cd when i wa buying my first cd player .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i think it is a very good song . i really enjoyed it ! i like the message that he is trying to get across , and it is a very good message . this song is a great song to sing in church , but i think i like it better in the car while i am driving .

1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	my favorite of the 12 song is the best thing that never wa but i love the whole collection . it my all time favorite album and i can not believe it is over a decade old . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it come in a nice jewel case . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it cool packaging , so i would definitely recommend it . it is a perfect album for a classic rock fan . i can not believe this is going to be in my collection for a long time .
0	this song is beautiful and i agree with other reviewer . i really like her voice .
0	a great album by a talented band . the only reason i gave it a 2 star is because it wa one of the first cd i bought on cdbaby .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	a i got older and grew more aware of my surroundings and surroundings became more diverse and complex but i never got to appreciate the depth and breadth of life . i have spent the past 14 year being exposed to music that ha helped me to understand the world around me and bring a greater perspective to the world around me .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	wow , i like this cd . but i can not buy it because of the break into part that is what is wrong with this cd .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i wish i could just put this album on all the time . it is a fantastic piece of music . so much color and energy .
0	i like this album a lot of song are well written , i like the music , but my favorite song is some good year and the other song i like are when you are down and out and i love her .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .

0	i wa hoping miley would have released a video , but i wa disappointed . i like the song .
0	karajan playedwhat wa probably his last concert intoronto , canada , on november 24,1979 .
0	i have listened to this album twice , and i just do not like it . i am sure it is fantastic . but it is not my cup of tea . it is just not . it is too bland even for me . i am a fan of the music , and i love the album , but this just wasnt my kind of thing . i am not gon na give it 5 star , because i know i am not the only one . i would love to hear more of his stuff though , because i am a huge fan , and i am not sure that i can tell the difference between his playing and what he ha on this album . it is just not my cup of tea . i guess i just can not stand his playing .

1	i wa listening to this cd last night . i wa amazed at how the sound wa . i like the way the sound wa when the piano played the first few note . then the sound got much better . that is what i like about the recording ( not the sound ) . i really liked the second and third recomends . i liked all of the recomends .

0	when i first heard this song i thought he sounded like the black eyed pea i thought he sounded like a rapper , and i am glad i wa wrong , he is a very good singer and his voice is different from any rap singer . i think this song fit well for a wedding and is an inspirational song for anyone who want to make their life more meaningful . i would definitely download this song for my wedding .
1	awol nation is a great album . i can not wait for a remix of this album . i really feel like this album will go down in history . awol nation is one of the biggest album in the mixtape game .

1	this is better than the original album . it wa very good .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .

0	i love the music of elvis presley so i wa excited about this album . i wa happy to see that he is still alive and well and making music . however , i wa not impressed . even with a $ 14.95 price tag , the quality of the sound is not what i had expected . it is not loud and it is not very clear . i am disappointed . i have only listened to 2 song so far .
1	the first time i heard this song it wa on the radio , but i did not know what it wa about . i have been a lover of depeche mode ever since . i have been a fan since the 1980s and this is one of my all time favorite album .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i do not think i have heard anything that sound so good . so many great song .
1	i have to say , i have never heard bonnie raitt sing better than she did on this album . while all the song on this album are great , this wa my favorite .

0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i listened to this album a few time when i wa a teenager and have been a huge fan of his ever since . this is the best ohearn album i have ever heard and it ha some of the best song . i have all his album and all his single . i would highly recommend this album to anyone who love music .
0	if you like the dave clark five and their classic song , i suggest you look up the greatest hit . it is a great album . and i will always recommend not listening to their cover of song like heart of glass because they sound like they were a bunch of 12 year old kid trying to imitate gnr . you suck and this cover suck .
0	the band first album , and one of the few that i have owned . i find the band growing up , though , that i am not impressed at all . it is not a bad album , but it is not good either . it is got a few song that will make your ear perk up , but other song are not good at all . there are a few song that i really like , but i do not think they are great song . i wa more into the band before , but now i do not really care for these song . they just seem to be filler , and i think that people who like the band could have done with a few better song . it is not a bad album , but i think that if it wa released in the eighty , it would have been much better .

0	i would call this a christian album . it is more like my typical church music . it is got a lot of praise , love , and worship song . it is not a deep a some of the other album i have listened to . i would give it a 5. i would say it is a 4.5/5 .
1	i like the chorus very much but not the rest of the song . the last line is just a little too long and i do not know if that is just me or not . it really is beautiful but the last line is not a beautiful a the other part of the song . thank you .
0	this is a good cd , but you need to get the other cd .
0	i am a huge fan of elvis , and i wa extremely excited to listen to this album . however , i wa disappointed to find that it wa not the elvis album . it wa only a compilation of song from other elvis album . but that is okay because i love them all !
0	this album is not meant to be listened to on any device other than a cd player . not even a ipod .
0	this is a classic compilation of music . it is not a classic collection , but it is a good collection of music to have on vinyl . i can listen to this all day , but i can not listen to all of it at once . the set is good , but not great , but i am not sure how to describe it any differently . it is a classic compilation of music from the 20th century . the sound is very good . the set is good for any classical music fan .
0	it is a fun song . it is not the same a the movie but it is still nice .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i bought this for my daughter because i love this song . i think it is great .
0	this is a very good album . i do not like this album . i do not like the music , but i think that the album ha some good moment and some good song . i do not like the way this album is made . i do not like the album because the song are bad and the musician play bad . i do not like the way this album is made . there are thing about the album that are good and there are thing that are bad . i do not like the music a it is . i do not like the artist .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i do not consider this song to be a good song . i find the lyric to be really bad , and the song to be just a really bad song . the beat is awful , the instrumentation is horrible , and the singing is horrible .
1	i have been a fan of this performer for many year . i bought this cd for my wife recently and she enjoys it . it wa a fun evening . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	this is a great album , but not for me . i like the different music , but i wish the music wa more varied , perhaps with more song .
1	this wa a really good album . i would give it a 9.5 if it had the track on the cd . i think it wa a little lacking on the first disc , but the cd is really good . it is very good for people who do not like trance . the only problem is that you can not download the track , but they are available to listen to online . i found them to be very well done . you can hear the difference in the production quality , and it is a very good album .
1	my kid love this song . it is a great song . i would give this song a 4. i love the new version .
0	this album is pretty much the same album , except for a few new song , and a couple of single , of song from the previous album , which i thought sounded a little more commercial . it is a good album , but you can not really tell if it is for a band or a solo artist , since they both sound the same . still , if you like a band you should buy this album , if you like a solo artist you should buy this album .
1	i bought this album a a gift for my husband and it wa a great gift . i have to say that the sound quality is excellent and the song are all great . the only downside to this album is that there are no vocal .
1	i have never been a big fan of this kind of music , but this is a good album . the song are decent . the album itself is okay , but it is nothing special .
0	i bought this album and i like it . i am not a perry como fan , but i like the music . however , the sound quality is very low compared to my ipod . the production quality is very poor .
0	i just did not like this song . i do not know why someone would buy this song . it is just a really bad song . it is a really crappy song and it just doe not seem to match the album . i do not know why anyone would buy this song . it is just a waste of time . it is a really crappy song . i do not know why anyone would buy this song . i do not like this song . i do not know why anyone would buy this song .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	i have to tell you that i love your site . this is how i discovered a great new band . the band is called the fuzz , they are awesome . i am not sure why you are not updating it on a regular basis . it is really , really cool .
0	i love this song !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	this is an amazing trance album ! this is the best trance album i have ever heard ! the best trance album i have ever heard !
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	this is a real treat for the discerning music lover , who is looking for genuine talent with the gift of music . i have often said that if you really want to know what you are listening to , then have a good look at the artist name a a clue to what to expect .
0	i love this album !
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	the album ha a lot of good stuff in it , but it is a really weak album . the first track is really good , but it is the rest of them that fall apart . i have listened to them a few time and i do not recommend them to everyone . the rest of the music is average . however , all of the song are very enjoyable . the song i can not stop is a great song . it is one i love to dance to . i believe the music video is in the work . it is called take me away and should be quite good . it should be released soon . the next cd i am buying is called home and it is a really good album . i love the name . it sound like home to me . it is a good album , but it is a little disappointing to me . i think it is very good and ha a lot of good stuff in it . it just ha a weak first track and it is the rest of the song that are weak . the song on this cd are the same a the other cd i am buying . it is a good album and it is a great song . it is take me away that is really great . it is a great song that i will always remember . i recommend this cd to everyone .
0	i am sorry to say this , but this record is one of the most disappointing album in my collection . i have listened to this album many time , and i can not remember the last time i enjoyed this album more . i suppose i should have listened to the entire album , but i just wasnt feeling it . the album is full of great track , but the track are really weak individually . i love the trance sound , but this album just did not grab me .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i do not like it . i can not understand the lyric . the music is fine , but the song just doe not make sense to me .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s . posthumus . i play it all the time . i never get tired of it .
1	j. ponder is a talented guitarist , who ha a sound that is different from that of most of the musician in the music business . listener often comment how different his playing is from most of the musician .
0	it is good . it is good . what kind of music do you listen to , because this is awful . i know it is a cover band , but this is a little too much . i would prefer if they would cover the song that they do cover . i have the entire gnr discography and i will be buying the next album . i would be happy if they would cover this song , but i can not understand what the song is about .
0	i like the sound , i like the bell and the drum . it is really nice . good composition . i really like the sound , i like the bell and the drumming . it is a nice composition .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i have heard about this album but i am so new to the whole online review thing that i did not really know what to expect . i wa blown away by the album . the quality of the song and mix is great and even though it is a bit dated now , i still feel it good . i wa pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and they are very easy to listen to . not to mention the fact that the song are all mixed so well together . i have to believe that if you play this album loud enough you will get the best out of it . i have a few friend that are avid fan and they all gave me their opinion and when i told them that i had heard this album and they could listen to it , they each said it sounded great and that it would be an easy listening for them at work . all in all i would have to say that this is a great album and i will definitely re-listen to it again . i have had it for about 30 day and have been listening to it non stop .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !

0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i first heard this song on the radio when they played it during the christmas special . i wa so excited to hear this song when i found the album . when i first heard this song , i could not believe that it wa on the album . this song is so fun to listen to and when i dance to it , i feel like i am on top of the world ! it make me want to dance and sing along . i hope you all like this song a well .
1	this song is one of the most well-known hit by brandy . it is a really amazing song with a very good beat . i am a huge fan of her music .
1	is an excellent album , with a rock feel to it , it can be enjoyed by all . even though it is a little old for me , i still like it . i have listened to it more than 50 time , but still enjoy it . if you like band like : ac/dc , led zeppelin , and iron maiden , this is a great album for you .
0	i have listened to this cd several time . the song were great and the vocal were good . i will be using this cd a a tool to help me relax after a long day . this is a very good cd .
0	this song ha a lot of love in it and it is a beautiful song
0	it is so damn short , but the song is catchy and fun . i am not really a fan of this song but i like the music video .
0	i am a fan of ohearn . i think his music is very good . this album is good , but i think there are many song that are repetitive . it is a good album if you like ohearns music or if you are a fan of old song .
0	i am not impressed . i have heard this song several time and it always get boring quickly and i can never figure out what the song is about .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	this is the first time in a long time that i have heard a cover of rock you like a hurricane . the instrumentals are good , but the vocal are not good . david lee roth is a talented singer , but this album doe not do it for me . i give this album a 3 star rating .
1	this album is pretty self-explanatory , but i wanted to say a little something about the album cover . it wa a big hit in the 1990s , and the band wa the opening act for the who at the garden . the band wa one of the first to ever wear a cape ( a cape wa kind of a cool thing back then ) and they really looked cool when they did it .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i think this song is awesome . it ha a great beat , and it get stuck in my head . i have never been able to stop whistling it . it is a great song .
1	jesus is all i need by joni mitchell is a very good song .
1	the dave d clark five cd is an excellent collection of song with a good choice of artist . dave clark is not only a great song writer , he ha a great sense of the audience . his song are good quality . the beach boy are one of the greatest rock and roll band of all time and this cd ha great song from the beach boy .
1	this is the best thing ever .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	in this cd , you can hear the early recording of the music and the brain .
1	this is my favorite album of his . it is so good . the song are just so good . i have never heard a more well-formed and cohesive album of his work . this is one that i will always remember .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this song is a little disappointing . i expected more from her . i think the song is well-written ( for a girl singer ) , but the lyric are a bit cliche .
1	this is the best book i have read in a long time . it is the first book in the series . i felt like i wa in the same situation a the main character , who is a successful businessman . i wanted to be her , but i could not . it is a very interesting and well written book that will hit home for anyone who is single or in a relationship . i really enjoyed reading this book .
0	for those of you who do not know me , i love this song . i think it is a great trance song with a lot of good lyric .
1	this cd wa released in the early 80 and i guess this is an early cd that contains all the song by the original cast of the show . it is a very good song list in my opinion . i would encourage you to purchase it but i also think you should take a look at the review i have written .
1	this is my life by r kelly is a good song , but i wa disappointed because it is more on the level of a typical jesus is all i need than a real jesus is all i need that i am familiar with .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this is one of the best album of the year so far . i am a diehard reo fan and this is the second release i have purchased . the other one wa the great album do not break the oath . this one is a great addition to the reo catalog .
1	i am a big fan of beethoven . this is the best recording of his piano concerto no . 5. i would love to play it on any instrument . the recording quality is excellent . the instrumentation is also excellent . this is a great performance of this piece .
0	i like this cd .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i have listened to whitney houston for a very long time . when i first heard whitney houston
0	i am a huge fan of trance music but most of my favorite trance artist come from the uk . some of the track that i have heard from the uk are excellent and make me want to go there for a visit . i enjoy state of trance 2008 , a you can imagine . it ha some great song , but sadly many of the track on state of trance are not in the same league a i would like . i would recommend you buy the state of trance if you want a good trance release . however , i feel that if you are an all trance fan , state of trance is not the best album out there .
0	i have to agree with the others , this cd is terrible ! i have been listening to it for a while , and it is just really repetitive ! i definitely do not recommend this .
0	i have been a fan of prince since his birth . i purchased this album shortly after his death . i wa saddened to learn his passing , however , i found it to be an excellent album that had a message for all people that are struggling with life .

0	this is an unimpressive cd . the sound quality wa horrible . however , i wa able to get it to play in my car and be enjoyable . the cd is $ 14.95 . i will not buy the cd again . i bought this cd . i will not be purchasing another cd from them .
0	it doe not really sound like a bruno mar album .
1	i like the song . the lyric are cool .
0	this song ha the best lyric i have ever heard . the guitar solo is incredible .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i thought this album wa great . i loved all alone with something to say , the song just a i am , the song mermaid .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	i listened to this song when i wa in school and i absolutely love it ! it make me cry everytime i listen to it .
0	this album is great , but jewel doe not know what to do anymore . she is always changing it up , but it is not the jewel i used to know .
1	this is an amazing album . great album with good sound .
0	karajan played what wa probably hislast concert in toronto , canada , on november 24 , 1979 .

1	this is excellent . i like this song .
0	the song is very good , but the lyric are very long and the song is not catchy .
1	i wa pleased to see this collection of the dave clark five song . i had been a fan of the group since cecilia and i am happy to have this collection of their old song . i have been buying their cd since the first one in 1964 , and i have been a fan of the dave clark five for a very long time . i have bought many of their cd , but this is the first collection i have seen . i think they will have a lot of fan again with this collection of their old song .
1	awesome . this song really is a must-have for any country music fan . it is my new favorite song , along with some good year and i am so lonesome i could cry .
0	a few year later in the 1980s , karajan wa diagnosed with pancreatic cancer .
1	this is a good cd . i am buying it . it is take me away that is great . it is a great song . this album is really good . i can not wait to hear the music video . and i recommend this cd to everyone .
1	this album is great . it ha a lot of song , and they are very well produced . the first track on the album is the lead track , which is very well done . the rest of them are very well done . i like the variety of song . the album is very well done .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i love this album . i am not really sure how i can say it is better than state of trance 2008 , but it is .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i like this album , but i could not find a song on it , so i bought this cd to see if there were any song i wa missing . i could not find a song on this cd , but i did find a song on another cd i had . i am not sure what i wa thinking buying this cd , but i did . i like it , and i do not understand why not many people like this album . i would suggest all people buy this cd if they like it .
1	this is a great prince album . i have found it on ebay . i wa very impressed . i will buy it a a cd .
0	this wa a great album , but i did not like any of the track . i liked the variety in the track , though . overall , it wa fun to listen to and overall a good album . i thought the production quality wa okay , but not that great .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i really liked this song . it is a nice change of pace from the other song in the collection , and it is a very nice ballad .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	i like this album , but i do not know why they change their sound . i think they are going in the right direction .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this is a nice album to listen to while driving . i would recommend to anyone that like the radio song .
1	i do like the song on this cd . the only problem is that it is a little hard to understand . i think that it is better than most of the cd i buy . i think that if i had just bought a cd , i would have given this one a 5 star rating .
0	this is the best movie . the movie is very emotional and the song is so beautiful . my family love this movie . we watch it so often . there is nothing better than watching the notebook over and over again . it make me feel like i am in a happy mood and that make me very happy . but watching the movie is not a good a listening to the song . the song is so beautiful that it make the movie even better . if you like the song , then you will love this movie . i hope you enjoy the notebook .
1	i like this song . well , i like it a lot . it is not my favorite song ever , but i like it a lot and i think it is a great song .
1	really great album , i love the song and the sound quality of the album is fantastic .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i love this song and i think it is very underrated .
1	this song is great . i wa in the car and the radio came on . it wa so beautiful i wa so happy . now i can find the rest of this cd !
0	it is amazing , this is a very good jazz album . i love it . john
1	this is such a great song . i love the fact that she sings it in her own . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice . this is such a great song . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice , and i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice . i love the fact that she sings the song she ha been waiting to sing for many year .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	this song wa very good , but i do not like it .
1	this is the song that make you wan na go out and play . you know you can not resist . it is like a love song , but it is not really a love song , it is more of a party song you get to dance to . the sound of it is perfect .
0	this album ha some really good song . there is a few song that are a bit repetitive , but most of the song are pretty good . i guess it is like the beatles say , if you are not happy with one song , then you can forget it . but the three song that are repeat after each other are really good .
1	wow , it is been a few year since i have heard her , but this is an amazing album ! i love that she ha the courage to put her opinion out there , i think she is a very intelligent and beautiful woman . not only is she intelligent , but she is also beautiful and ha a lot of charisma . i hope people listen to her music .
0	i have heard this song on the radio , but i have not heard it on any record . this song is beautiful . i especially like the part where the piano play the melody . i have been listening to this song for many year and always enjoy hearing different version of this song made by different people .
0	this ha to be the worst album ever made . it is awful . it is bad . you have to buy it . it is not even worth buying .
1	i have been listening to this song for a few month now and i love it ! i think it is worth the money , and i think it is a great song . it is great , and i love it .
1	i love all your music . i have been following your site for a long time . i have found many song that i never would have found . i have purchased some of your cd . love all the music .
0	i do not understand this tape . if it is supposed to be a classical/rock album , then it is no different from other album . the vocal , the instrumentation , the arrangement and the music are very different to each other . i do not know which is which . it just baffle me .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i love my window phone but my laptop is way better

0	i love it ! i will give it a four star because the song is awesome .
1	great cd . his music is very personal . i have found it hard to find other artist that are a personal and a well
1	i have never heard of this band before , but i like their music . the vocal on the song are really cool , and the melody on the song are great . the song on the album are great .
0	the first thing you notice about this is that it is the same album a their first grateful dead release . the second thing is that this is the only album in the series that doe not have a single cut that is worth the price of admission . if you want the first album , i suggest buying it from the library ( and saving yourself that $ 20 ) . if you want the others , wait until they are released on cd or dvd for a better price .
0	the end of barbras part is really irritating . it is like someone is trying to make an awful joke out of their last ever show .
0	i love the song . i first heard it in church at a youth camp ( i wa 10 ) . it wa a great way to spend a few minute and really get into it . it is always in my playlist to listen to when i feel like meditating .
0	i like jewel but this is just a little too much . i agree with those who said that this album is just a little too rock . i like what i hear . i like what i like . i do not like what i do not like . i am not gon na buy this cd . i just want to like it .
1	i really enjoyed this cd . i am a big fan of this group , and they really can turn any song into a great song .
0	i really enjoyed this album .
1	i think this is the best whitney houston album and a true classic . it is one of my favorite whitney houston album .
1	i have to be honest , i have never heard this song before , but it is definitely one of the better one on this cd . i am a big fan of christmas song , and this one is especially nice .
0	awol , it is a good song .
1	i do not think i have heard one or two song on this album that i did not like .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	just plain good song . it is like a little tune . very enjoyable .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	this is my first ever review . i am new to the site and have not yet discovered the power of the internet . this is a good album . the only problem is that many of the song are repetitive . i would recommend this album to anyone who like classical music .
0	i love miley cyrus music . the music industry is great . i like miley cyrus and i love her music . i love miley cyrus music . i love miley cyrus music . i like miley cyrus and i love her music . miley cyrus is a great artist . i love her music . miley cyrus is a great artist .
0	i would like to say there wa more variety on this album , but overall the song on this album did not seem to have that much variety .
1	i am currently in between phone and would like to get a g2 . i would like to get one with the keyboard and the voice command . the battery last all day and the screen is bright , so
0	i am extremely disappointed that i did not get a chance to hear this album until now . i love reo speedwagon so much , so i am very disappointed that i did not get to listen to this album until now . i wa really looking forward to listening to it . i can not believe i did not get to hear this album until now . i do not think i would ever consider buying this album again .
0	good song . i am not sure if the song would be better if she sang more like she did in the other album . but she sings very well .
0	i just received my cd of the dave clark five and i love it ! it is a terrific collection of classic rock & roll . i love the song i got a new bag .
0	this cd is so badly recorded it sound like it is from the 80 . i believe someone should go to the hospital and get the doctor to give me a second opinion .
1	i like the cd and the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about it . very nice sound .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i am a fan , and this song wa on my playlist .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i bought this cd in a hurry , and i am pleased . this is a good country album .
0	i like keith . i think he is a great musician .
1	this is a catchy song ! i love the melody and i love the message . it is a great song to play while you are waiting in line at the doctor .
0	this is a song that i have been enjoying for several week . you are a nice site . i like your cover . i like the sound of your cover . i like the way the song is presented . thanks for the song . bob
0	i have been listening to this cd for a while now and i love it . it is a musical journey that take you on a spiritual journey . allan bole
0	this album is better than it sound . the song are really good . the lead singer is great . the song are very entertaining . i do not recommend anyone to buy this album .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i love this song . it ha some of the most beautiful vocal harmony i have ever heard . the piano/guitar/vocal harmony are at the top of their game . they sound like they are from a concert hall . the harmony in this song are so good , i wish they were sung in one voice . however , this one ha a very good vocal melody . i think this song could be used in many different type of worship service .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	great cover of this song . i have been listening to a few of your song and i like them , and i think you are a good site . i have enjoyed listening to some of your song . i am probably not going to buy any of them . i will have to take your word for it . bob
1	i am a big fan of hasselvander . he wrote a song , do not do this , i thought it wa amazing . i really like his album . this one is good .
1	i have been a fan since the 1980s and this album is one of my all time favorite . i have listened to this album about 200 time . it is a wonderful collection of song and i highly recommend it to anyone who love music .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	this album ha a lot of positive song , but the song are very repetitive and do not have much new thing to say . i do not like the lyric of the song . when i listen to the song , i think that he ha been trying to write good song for a long time and that he is not able to do it .
1	best cd i have ever heard in my life ! it is soooo good ! so many great song . i can not believe i did not know of this cd before this ! i am not one to listen to a cd everyday , but this one i will listen to everyday !
1	this album is great . the song are great . the vocal are great . i loved the album . i just wish the album wa a little longer . i will buy the album .
1	this cd is a great gift for someone who love music .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	i like the band but i am disappointed that they have put out a new album . it is not the new album . it is the old album . it sound like the old album . i have been waiting for a new album .
1	i like this cd but i wish sam sparro would sing something that wasnt so annoying . i like the song , and the song content , but i just do not like sam voice . it sound too high , too nasal , and too repetitive . i feel like the song is missing something . it is not bad , but it is not what i would call a good example of rocker song .
0	i bought the cd , and i like it .
0	i bought this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i thought it wa great .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i like listening to the song on this cd . i really like listening to the song on this cd . i really like the song i know i will be happy because i have a friend who is very happy .
0	i have listened to this cd a lot of time . i like the song on this album .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i love listening to bonnie raitt album because her music is so inspirational and i

1	when i got to the end , i realized that there were five more song . i have all the cd . i would like to have heard this one . i really liked it . i will listen to the other three song before i buy the other cd .
0	i thought this wa a ballad . i almost bought it . but it is not . i thought it wa . but i am not . so i did not buy it . i like the song , but i am so glad that i did not listen to it . it seemed like it wa about an unhappy relationship . i did not want to listen to that . it made me feel like i needed to be with that guy .
1	i did not like the movie . the song wa great , but the movie wa better .
1	a good cd with some great song . i did not like some of the song , but i still like the cd .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	nice song . it is a nice ballad and very well written . the vocal are nice , but the song is too short . the song ha a good beat , but the song end way too fast .

1	this is a great album . i am glad this one doe not have the dance track . it is all very happy and peaceful .
1	this song ha some religious connotation . there are reference to god and jesus , so it might be viewed in that light . it is not a hymn in the traditional sense , but i am a christian and believe in the gospel of jesus and i believe this song is well done .
0	it is mp3 download . the product wa exactly what wa advertised . once again , i did not receive what wa advertised .
1	this is very good . it is a good song . it is a good track . i have to say that i really like this album .

1	steve morse and pete knopfel are the king of the guitar
0	i do not like this album .
0	this is my second tape of the year . this tape is great , i love the way they sound .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i am very , very sorry that this album is too short for me .
0	it is good , but i do not like the voice . i have done it before , but i do not like it .
1	this song and the other song in the i believe in jesus playlist are both excellent worship song . the lyric are very brief and simplistic , but the music is very powerful .
1	this is my first cd , so i do not have anything to compare it to . i have listened to quite a few cd over the year and this one get 5 star from me . the only thing i dislike about it is the fact that it is not in a jewel case .
0	i have been a longtime fan of the tom scott band . i have never been a fan of his singing . but , i do enjoy having him a a part of the band . this is a solid album , but i will not buy it . it is a shame , because i think it is a good album . i like it . i will buy it if i ever hear it on the radio .
0	i do not know why i bought this album , but i did .
1	this is a great album . it is so relaxing , just a lot of fun . i do love the song on this album .

1	i really enjoyed the cd , i love the song .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i love this band so much . i have listened to this song on a daily basis for the past 4 year .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .

1	i like the song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i like the song , but i wa disappointed and bothered by the fact that it wa not available in store .
1	the whole cd is incredible . it is truly an incredible collection .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this wa a great cd . the music wa of high quality and the recording were very good . the arrangement of the song are very well done . i bought this on impulse but i am glad that i bought it . it wa well worth the money and i will buy more . i do have to say , when i first listened to the song i realized the cd wa a bit confusing for some of the song , but after a few moment they became much more clear .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .

0	i really liked it . i wish it wa longer .
1	this is a wonderful book about the great and the great lost master of classical music . however , it is one very important artist that it wa not able to capture the magic of is , namely claude debussy , whose only recorded work is the last movement of his prelude for piano and orchestra . i have a number of recording of this work ( several on cd ) and i can truly say that this is debussy best work . anyone who want to gain a deeper understanding of debussy work need to read this book . it is not a biography or even a history of the composer . it is a biography of debussy a a person and his work . this is one book that you will never regret buying .
1	nice app to use with child .
0	i like it . i like it very much .
1	bonnie is one of my favorite singer . this album i liked a lot . i wa surprised i could like it . it is more fun to listen to than i expected .

0	i am not sure about this cd . i have purchased a few cd from this artist and always liked his cd . this wa by far the worst in my opinion
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard . the guitar is superb , and the sound quality is excellent .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	one of the worst song i have ever heard . i do not really care about this song . it ha a catchy hook and some good lyric but i am not sure why i even bothered rating it .
0	it is a great song , but i just do not have a very good opinion on it .
1	this is a great cover . it is not a parody , it is not a tribute , and it is not a cover . it is actually the best cover of the original , and i doubt you will find another .
1	i really liked this show . the host are good . the music is good . they make you think . they make you think about something . i would listen to this show again .
1	this is a great album . i really like the member of this band .
0	i like it . the lyric are clever .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is one of the best song by jon lord . i always enjoy listening to his music .

1	excellent . i like the music and the choice of movie . i will be buying more for the iphone .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i wa looking for a rock album this weekend and stumbled upon this . the album cover look like a music magazine cover , with a guitar strapped to it , and a large , black plastic globe of a planet in the background . the music is very good , and the sound is not just a little better than some of the other record i have heard , but it is better than a lot of the other record i have heard . the only real downside is that the cd ha a lot of scratchy , digital distortion , and the album is very , very thin . i would have preferred the same amount of detail in the sound , and more of a real recording .
1	she is simply amazing .
0	i love this album . the song are all great . especially the title track . it is a shame they did not do this a a single .
1	i am a huge fan of the song that are included in this collection . all the track are excellent , and the compilation is a great idea .
1	first of all , i loved it . i wa totally amazed by how long it took to make this album . i have to say , the production on this album blew me away . it is a very unique mixture of style , and it is very , very well done . i could listen to it forever .
0	i would give this a 5 star rating if it were not for the stupidly long cd copy . it is the original copy of the album purchased by me for over 25 year . i bought it in 1989 and i still have it despite having it copied on cd by amazon . i can not understand why anyone would copy it . i am a big fan of allen , but not of the cd .
0	i love the song in this album . the song i listen to are goodbye , love song , the best thing in the world , the boyfriend song , my girl and i will be over you .
0	it is great and i have done it too .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i listened to this song for the first time and wa hooked . i love the melody and the chorus . i love the whole song . this song is a great one . it is really a good song . i like this song . i like this song . i like this song .
0	the man who sings this stuff sound like he is in his 70 . he is only 26. so , yeah , this is not a terrible album , but for the price , i would have preferred to get a lesser one .
0	i have been listening to this band for year and just recently discovered them all . i like the new record , but not a much a the older one . i do like the new one though . i really liked the first album , especially black diamond but it is not a good a the second .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i guess i will just have to wait for the dvd to come out . i just wish it were here in the state . it would have been better if they had a dvd here in the state .
0	this is a great album for the early fall . i bought this for my 8 year old son and he enjoyed it very much . i bought it for my four year old daughter and she enjoyed it . i bought it for my two daughter and they loved it also . i bought it for my wife and she enjoyed it also . i bought it for my husband and he enjoyed it also . this is a great cd for the fall . - you are the best thing i have ever done - thank you for the life you gave me - you are the best thing i have ever done
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	it is the song that every country music fan know and understands .
0	very well remade by him . i have to say that he wa very good in his own way . there is no comparison to his original .
0	not the one i heard when i wa little .
1	a great song .
1	this is one of my favorite song on this album . i love the lyric . it make me think of when i wa a little girl
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this is just a good a the cd version , but it just doe not have all the song .
1	i love this album . i love the dave clark five and i love the way in which they added a few song to a song list . i like the way in which the song are arranged . there are some amazing tune on this album .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	the word are so stupid ! they are so stupid ! i mean , in the beginning of the song , it say the sun is shining . then , in the middle of the song , it say the sun will be shining in 10 year . and , in the end , it say the sun is still shining . how did they even come up with a song like this ?
0	this is cool , funny song . the vocal harmony are ok , but the song is too predictable .
1	i feel that this album is a little over-produced , but the song are good and the music is good .
1	i like it . i like the movie version way better .
1	this album is everything i have been waiting for all my life ! i have been listening to this album from the beginning and i love it ! i can not wait to hear the new album and have had the album on repeat since it wa released . i am very excited to hear what they have in store for u with this album . it is very well put together and ha a very good sound quality and is very listenable .

1	i love this album , and i think it is one of the best album of all time .
0	i listen to her music all the time , and i love her music .
1	i love this song ! it is my favorite ! the other song are ok , but this is my favorite .

0	this song is awesome . i could listen to this song over and over again . this song is one of the best song of the year .

1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i guess i should have done this a long time ago , but i thought i would check out the first one on the karajan label . i usually listen to lamour et la mer when i want to get back in touch with my love for karajan , and then later i listen to lenfant when i want to get back in touch with my love for karaja . the first song i download wa lenfant , which is the original recording . ( i do not know if it is the same version that wa recorded in paris , but i know it is a different version . )
1	this is just great ! i love it !
1	i am not a fan of the hurt singer , but i am not going to get into too much detail here . i just wanted to say the song is a blast . it is an easy listen , with powerful , yet simple , lyric . it is like a bluesy version of the song piece of mind with a heavier attitude . the song is played by an excellent band , including a very underrated guitarist , and i highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for the classic rock of the 60 .
1	this is a great album . not one of those album . i do love the genre of worship because i am into all of that and i love the style and the message . i would really like to try a worship album by a worship artist . i have not found one that i love a much a this one .

0	this album doe not disappoint . it is a lot of fun .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	it is one thing to listen to a cd of music by an artist you know and love ; it is another to have a cd that is a collection of song that you have never heard before . i do not know about anyone else , but i like the idea of discovering new music , but when it is a compilation of song that i have never heard , it is not a good thing .
1	the original , by the way , is not on youtube . i have searched for it for awhile , but i did not find it . i will try to find it .
1	i bought this a few month ago , and it is a great player . the sound is really good , and the price is very good . it can play cd and mp3s .
0	i have a bad feeling about this one . it is a bad song .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .

1	tom scott brings out the best in his music .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i have not listened to this cd yet but i am sure it is good . it is been a long time since i heard a cd that sound like this . i like the song .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i did not like this cd . i listened to it for the first time while listening to the radio . i really do not like the song i am free by miley cyrus . it is just too much yelling . i think there are other song that are better . this cd is one of the worst cd i have ever listened to .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i think that this album is great . it is different from the other r & b album that i have heard , and the song are fun . i will buy this album again .
0	i wanted to like this cd but it just so so . it wa too bad that i had to listen to it a i wa in the middle of cleaning house . i am not sure if it is the cd , but the song on it were very repetitive and boring . i am pretty sure that i will not buy another cd for several year . this is just too much . i am very disappointed . it wa worth the money , but it just fell short in my opinion . i would recommend this to others . i think that this is a great cd . i am glad i bought it . but it just fell short to me . i do not know if the cd is worth it . i guess i will just have to be happy with the cd that i bought and hope that the next one is even better . i will listen to it again .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	really nice clean version .
1	i listened to this album on my drive home . i like most of the song
0	this is a very good album . the song are very good . the music is very good and the lyric are very good . i have heard a lot of grateful dead song and i really liked this album . it ha a very good sound quality . the only bad thing is that the song are too long and you have to listen to them over and over again to get the full effect of the song .
0	one of my favorite . i have heard this song many time , and it never get old . i really like the video , too .
0	this is a cute song . i like the lyric , but the music is pretty bad . it is a little too soft and too quiet for my taste . it is also one of the song that is only played for about 2 second . i feel like i am listening to something stuck in my head . i am sure it will be great when it come out on cd .
1	love this album . i have the cd and it is great . i listened to it for about 2 hour and it is got a great flow .
0	i do not care for her music , but this is a great song . i am really not a huge jewel fan . i just like her music . still , i would love to play this one at a concert .
1	the dave clark five were known for their harmony . it is a shame that this song is sung without them . i believe it would have been a much better song without all the extra vocal .
1	i feel this album will forever hold a special place in my heart . the first time i heard it i felt so bad for the people who do not know about this band . this album wa the first time i truly understood what the band wa about and i have listened to it over and over . ( i still like the other album too . ) i love the vocal especially on lollipop and the acoustic version of mountain song . i would like to add that i wa a fan of them in high school .
0	i really really liked this song , but i did not like it .
0	this is a great song about standing up for your right . it is empowering for a young girl like her .
0	what the hell is this cd ? it is a commercial cd . the music is all the same stuff that is in state of trance 2007 and 2008. what the hell is this cd ? the track range from good to horrible , with the average being pretty good . i do not know why i can not find one decent track on this cd , but if you are expecting a good quality cd , you will be disappointed . this cd ha been played by several people , and they all said it wa the same cd a the state of trance 2007. this is a waste of money .

1	i liked the way the song wa sung . i liked the way it wa performed .
0	this is not a song . it is a video . i think it is a good idea to have a video song for a video but even if the song is good , it doe not belong in the video . it would be better to have a separate song , since it doe not really fit in with the video anyway .

1	this song is a classic and a great way to end an album . not everybody can sing , but for me it is very enjoyable . i like the part about barbra streisand . she look like she is singing to me .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	great stuff !
1	this is old , but i like the song . it is a good song .
1	i have listened to this album over and over , and continue to listen to it . i find that i can listen to her with the same pleasure that i hear her sing on her album . i have listened to her with a little more knowledge and i can understand her lyric better . i am not the only one who find this cd interesting . i have had discussion with many of her fan about this album and it is a real pleasure to listen to . i hope she continues to make these album . i love listening to jazz . i would like to see her make a film . i would like to see her perform a song from this album on our local television station . i would like to see her perform at our local radio station . i hope she make more film . i hope she continues to release more cd . i hope she continues to make more music . i hope she will continue to write and release more cd . i hope she writes more book . i hope she writes her autobiography . i hope she writes more book and release them . i hope she make more film . i hope she performs in film . i hope she make more movie . i hope she make more movie . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she put more painting on the wall of her home . i hope she put more painting on the wall of her home and on her wall . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she paint more picture . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe painting . i hope she doe painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she make more painting . i hope she make painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she creates more painting . i hope she creates more painting . i hope her painting will be seen by many people . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her home . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her house . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her apartment . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her bedroom . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her living room . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her study . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of
0	i love this band . i have heard them a number of time . they are real big band type , and their music is excellent . they have great musicianship and excellent vocal .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	it is very good , i like it .
1	this piece of music is very relaxing and soothing . it is uplifting and make me feel very relaxed .
1	i enjoy the album . i like the originality of the music . i think that lareine ha come a long way from the beginning . the album is in my opinion , the very best album she ha ever done .
0	i have bought this album because it is the first one i have listened to . i like most of the song and i wa disappointed to find out they are not original . the song are not worship song and i will not be singing them . i will not be buying it again . i wish they would put a better selection on the cd .
0	i have a friend who is a big beatles fan , so i thought i would buy a cd of his favorite song . however , i wa very disappointed and i will never buy another beatles cd .
1	this album is good . it ha a lot of great song on it . the only thing that i do not like is that every song start off with an ear worm . it is annoying if you can not turn it off .
0	i do not know why , but this song make me cry every time i hear it . it is an amazing song .
1	i wa looking for a song to listen while my wife wa away . i heard this song online while waiting for my wife to get home . i loved the lyric , loved the sound of the acoustic guitar , and absolutely loved the bass line . that is the main reason i bought this cd . i wa so impressed that i bought it a a gift for a friend . i have not listened to it yet , but i will soon .
0	the song and the video are very cheesy . i like this song better when it is not put on a loop and when it is just the one song .
0	i like the music that this woman ha to offer . i do not like the fact this woman is married . she is one of those people who have no life . she is a shadow in my life . i do not know why i like her music so much . it is not very good . i will not be buying this cd .
1	this cd is a mix of popular classic and obscure piece from the great american songbook . of all the cd i have purchased recently , this one is the best . the song are not only well chosen , but they are catchy . the only flaw i see on this cd is the poor sound quality . i have a cd player at home , and you can not hear the difference between this and the cd player .
1	this is a really great tape ! i highly recommend it . i love it .
1	this is the best music i have heard in a long time . i have been in the business for nearly ten year and i have never had a cd that i have not liked . i have a cd of christmas music that i get from my local radio station , and i love the song on that cd . this cd is just the best . i am currently listening to the last song on this cd called i do not need you , and it just melt me to tear . i can not believe this cd won a grammy . i am waiting to hear the other song . i will be ordering this cd for my daughter and myself to enjoy . thanks amazon .
1	i just finished listening to this album . it is a good album . the song are a little repetitive but that is how i like it
0	i bought it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those which like country .
0	this cd is not for me . the only song i could stomach wa mama , i am coming home . i am a big fan of r.kelly , but this is not his best album . it is a little rough . i do not have much of a problem with the lyric ( i think that is r.kellys issue ) . but , the music is not his best . it doe not have that piano sound . it ha a little bit of a jazzy sound to it . also , the tempo is a little fast , which i do not like . the first few song are very fast , which i found distracting . also , it is an album that is almost one-note - you can not really tell what song it is , you know . the only one that i could get into wa mama , i am coming home . it is a very good song though .
1	i have already purchased a couple of album , and this is right up there . i love the lyric and the music and the beat , and i think i will continue to buy this album in the future .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i love it when a song is not a hit ( or hit it is not a hit ) but it still a song to you , thats my favorite song , and i love all of your song so it is a good song .
1	i have seen this song many time . i love the word and the note . i love the way that the note are repeated in the song . it make the song more interesting . i also like the way that the piano is used throughout the song . i listen to this song a lot . i really enjoy listening to this song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	my wife and i recently purchased this album and listened to it and we loved it . we did a lot of research on the artist and we felt that he had potential . this album is not a bad album at all and the music is very well done . the only thing that make this album not worth the money is the song sidewalk from the album skyworld . this song doe not fit at all with the rest of the album . i do not know how we missed this before .
0	i am really not a fan of her music in the first place . i like her voice , but i do not love her music . her music is very similar to the music of other artist such a joss stone and lyle lovett . i would rather listen to the musician who have been influenced by the artist she is been influenced by . i do like joss stone music , but it is not jewel . and lyle lovetts music is not jewel either , so it is a little unfair to compare them .
0	i do not feel this album is worth buying . i purchased it hoping for a complete compilation of her work , and i am disappointed . i do not understand why she did not release a new cd with the other song from her first 4 album , or at least a deluxe collection of all her song . i would have bought the entire collection , and would have paid a small amount more , but it would have been worth it for her to include the other song . also the album doe not have any great song on it that i really like . i find the song to be average in quality , but uninteresting , and i had purchased her first 4 album to hear the music i had not heard before . if she ever release a new cd with all of her song , i will buy it . if not i will wait until she release another album with more of her music .
0	the song is a little better than the movie . the song wa ok. it just did not have any emotion in it .
0	i love these song so much , i wish i could buy them all , but i can not . i also wish that bonnie had recorded more original song . i love the cover art , too .
0	lyric are pretty . they are not outstanding . i love the way she sings . i have learned this from her . but , i do not feel that she is singing very well . she sound like she is singing a musical phrase out of the key , but there is no emotion behind it . i am not sure if i am giving this album too much credit . it is hard to do this with the song that are featured .
1	this cd wa given to u a a gift . we love it . we listen to it a lot . it is a classic .
1	my heart belongs to you is a powerful ballad about the love that one ha for a person . it ha a soft , romantic feel to it , and the word just sound wonderful .
1	i love every dave clark five album .
1	if you love prince , you got ta check out the album called the vault from prince ex-wife and new wife . i know this album is called the vault , but prince ex wife and new wife wrote the song on this album .
1	this song ha an amazing beat and it is a good song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i wa just getting into elvis presley and so i wa pretty excited about this album . i wa happy to see that he wa still alive and making music . i did not like his music at all , and i really hope he dy soon . the music is good , but i do not think it is worth the $ 14.95 . i will probably not purchase it again .
0	i am a big fan of e.s.posthumus , i like him alot . i do not , however , like this cd . i do not like the song e.s . posthumus or i am not dead .
0	this album wa not my favorite , but it wa on my list of most important album of 1990 .

0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	the song wa great but the video is just horrible .
0	i do not like it at all . it is an average album . i can not stand oasis . it is not even worth listening to .
0	this is a pretty cool song . i wa really surprised by the quality of this song . i have been a fan of her since her first album , and i have gone to her concert many time . i wa really surprised that this wa a good song . it is really different from the other song she ha released . it ha a great tune .
0	i have never liked this song . i have always liked the version of this song that the tv show had on the show the real adventure of jonny quest but i hate the new version because it is so fast that i do not even notice it . i have never liked this song because it wa always something that i would say i do not like this song but i do not want to listen to the other song i have to say that i have always liked letting go and love me like there is no tomorrow but this is one of those song that everyone just want to hear and i always forget . since i have so many cd , i do not really know what i am going to end up buying next . i do not know if it is a good song or not but i always like listening to it .
0	a great movie song ! i love the video , too .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i have been listening to this album for a while now and i have to say that i loved it . i never thought i would like this album but i found it really enjoyable and i think it one of the best album of the year . i am a big fan of progressive/avant-garde music and i really like the combination of different style that scott creates . i find it difficult to put my finger on what it is about this album that really caught me and got me thinking . it is not easy to put into word . my favorite are in the pocket , wave of life and aint no future and i love the way he approach traditional jazz in a way that i have never heard anyone do.it is so cool and interesting to me to hear a musician use the past to create new sound and image . i think this album is fantastic and a must have for any jazz fan , whether you are a novice or know a little about the genre .
1	lareiners is a really good song .
0	i like the beat and lyric .
0	this is the third song in the album , and i do not know if it wa a favorite of beethoven , but this song fit the beethoven theme . it is a good song , but i am not so sure about the instrumentation and the vocal .
0	i have been a christian for almost twenty year , and i listen to christian music everyday . i am very excited to listen to this cd . it is very good christian music with some very good slow song on the cd . i love this cd . i would recommend this cd for anyone who is interested in christian music .
0	this is boring .

0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	she is a great singer , but she doe not have the right amount of vocal power . if you are looking for a pretty singer , she ha one , but she doe not have the right amount of vocal power to carry this song . also , the song is not a really good song .
0	i like this cd so much that i ordered 10 more of it . i got a refund , and i am not mad because of it . i like a lot of their song . i do not know why i like this cd so much . i just like it .

0	i have never had a problem with this song . i have never had it stuck in my head . i believe the only way i can get through it is by playing it . i have heard it on the radio and it is always stuck in my head .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	what a horrible song . i like the hook but this song is so bad that it take away all the good that the rest of the song add . it is so bad that i feel bad for the singer .

1	this should be a good buy . i like the app .
0	i have listened to this a few time and i am really enjoying it . his production is very good ( like most of his music ) . i would classify this a a prince album , but not a his best . it ha a lot of great song . i really like the song come and raspberry beret . the other song on this album are not a good a come or raspberry beret .
0	i do not know how this song is good . it is so bad , and boring , and i can not stand it .
0	i love my laptop ( window phone ) !
0	i do not like this song . it is just a really bad song .
1	this is a great song . i like the harmony and the way you use the piano . i hope you get the chance to do more music .
1	i downloaded this song a a practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the mp3 from amazon - the process is easy . the song is very melodic and it ha a little bit of emotion to it . the way the song end is to die for .
0	i bought this cd expecting a great song . it is just a song . it is not a song i remember hearing before . i would not buy it .

1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i love this song . if you do not know the song , you just must listen to it . and if you do know the song , you must listen to it . and if you do not know the song , but you know the band , you must listen to this song .

0	what can i say ? i love this band . they are my all time favorite , and i had the same reaction to this album a many of you do . they are a supergroup of musician and artist , and i am thankful that they are able to stay together .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	i like the first 3 track on this album , but this song is just . ugh .
1	i am not really a fan of the rock sound , but i like the song . it is not bad .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i am a fan of her music . i love the song all alone with something to say . i love the song mermaid . i love the song the one you love . i love the song just a i am . the album came on my work computer with the wrong track order on the cd . i hate being put on hold or having to wait on hold . this wa the most annoying cd i have ever had to wait on hold for .
0	this is a good song , but it is a cover of a song that come from the 1930s . it is a song about the meaning of life and it is sad . it make you think and it is not a good song .
0	i downloaded kiss from this site to practice my singing . it wa easy to download , and then it would not download . it ended up not being a good song . it is a good idea to download from amazon , but that is it .
0	i wa a huge fan of the band the clash when i wa young , and while i am not a huge fan of any of the other punk band like the sex pistol , i really enjoyed this album . i saw them live at the roxy in new york city where they played a lot of this album a well a many other punk anthem , and it wa a very good concert .

0	i love this cd . i can not get enough of this . i play it all the time . i love the harmony of the song . i have a love/hate relationship with christmas music . this is a great collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with the vocal by marie osmond .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is an outstanding collection of the best song from the late 70 , early 80 that is on cd and lp . the album great song include in the air tonight by stevie nick , shout by van morrison , all because of you by hall and oates , one by paul simon , i could have
1	i love this cd ! my wife and i are trying to decide whether to get the other cd . we have listened to them all and they are all great . i love allan bole , and the music is so relaxing that i have been listening to it on the drive to work , and i have been listening to it right after i get home . i could not think of a better cd to listen to right after a stressful day at work . so far , allan bole is the best , and i love his music .
1	this is another great album i have heard . this album ha great instrumentals and i like it a lot .

0	i can not listen to this album . so many thing are off , and it just doe not sound like the album i remember .
0	this wa played in my band show , but never in a live show . i have seen it used in a lot of show and the crowd always seems to love it .
0	i bought it to hear this song . i wa very disappointed . it wa just a mediocre version of the song . it didnt have the full emotion . it had alot of background noise . it wa just a very mediocre rendition . i am sorry i dont have the money to buy the cd on ebay so i will return it . i would have been better off buying it from the internet . i mean i love this song , i just hate that it wasnt the full version . it is just an average song .
1	i have been a fan of maria houghton music since i wa a teenager . her voice always brings me joy . i love perry comos music , and this is the best christmas album i have ever heard .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a few week now and i am enjoying it . i think it is a great mix of all the genre . i do not know if a cd with that much variety or that much variety of genre would make it to my cd player - but i do not think it would .
0	i just purchased this song and i love it . i have always loved this song . the lyric are great and i like the rhythm . it is still my go to song .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i do not have any complaint about this song .
0	i like this song . i like the melody and the chord .
1	this song is so beautiful . i love the melody and i love the message . i have been watching the video , and it is so disappointing . it is very cartoony . i would like it to be more sophisticated , and le cartoony .
1	i have to say , i like the dead .
1	the music is good . the harmony are good . the lyric are good . i like the song . the song is good . i like the song .
0	i just like this album , but it is not really a good album . the song are very good , but the band is just boring and just doe not grab me . i think they should try something else .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	it wa a bit underwhelming , but otherwise a good song .
1	the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are very beautiful . the music is very pretty , and so is the production . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are very beautiful . the production is very pretty , and the lyric are very clever . the music is very pretty , and the production is very pretty . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are very beautiful . the music is very pretty , and the production is very pretty . the music is very pretty , and the production is very pretty . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are very beautiful . the vocal are very beautiful , and the music is very pretty . the music is very pretty , and the production is very pretty , the song are very pretty , the song are very pretty , the song are very pretty . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful , and the music is very pretty , the song are really beautiful , the song are really beautiful . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful , the production is very pretty , the production is very pretty , the production is very pretty , the song are really beautiful , the song are really pretty . the lyric are very clever , the vocal are beautiful , the production is very pretty , the production is really pretty , the song are really beautiful , the song are really pretty , the song are really pretty , the song are really pretty , the production is really pretty , the song are really beautiful , and the song are really pretty , the song are really pretty . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful . the production is very pretty , the vocal are beautiful , and the song are really beautiful . the song are really beautiful , the song are really pretty , the song cover a lot of ground , and cover a lot of ground , and cover a lot of ground , and i would say that this is a very good album . the lyric are very clever , the vocal are beautiful , the song are really beautiful . the song are really beautiful , the song cover a lot of ground , and of course there is a lot of variety . the lyric are very clever , the vocal are beautiful , the production are really beautiful . the song are really beautiful , the song cover a lot of ground , and there is a lot of variety . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful , the song are really beautiful , the song cover a lot of ground , there is a lot of variety , the song are really beautiful , the song cover a lot of ground . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful , there is a lot of variety , the song are really beautiful , the song cover a lot of ground , there is a lot of variety . the lyric are very clever , the vocal are beautiful , the production is really beautiful , the song are really beautiful , the song are really pretty , the production is really pretty , the production is really pretty , the song are really beautiful . the lyric are very clever , the vocal are beautiful , the production is really pretty , the production are really beautiful , the song are really pretty , the production are really beautiful , the song are really beautiful . the song are really pretty , the song are really pretty , the song cover a lot of ground . the lyric are very clever , and the vocal are beautiful , the song are really beautiful , the song are really pretty ,
1	it is downloadable and , although it is not , it is exactly what wa advertised .
1	i bought this cd to listen to on the way to work . i have never heard of this band or artist but i would take the cd with me if i were going to a concert . the song that i am having trouble listening to is candyland i think .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is an amazing album . the track are very well produced . the song have great energy and are extremely emotional . the music is very relaxing . the album is highly recommended .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i am so glad i found this jazz album on amazon . it is great ! the first two song are very good . i am a big fan of jazz and this is one of my favorite album . it is nice to have a jazz album on cd . i like the different style of jazz the artist ha created . the lyric are very good . i like the sound of the guitar .
1	this is a collection of recording of the music and the brain series by dr. robert ornstein . the recording are made in the 1960s . it is important to note that ornstein wa a highly respected physician who wrote several book and had been the director of the medical university of south carolina for many year . ornstein wa well known for the way he made his recording . he used the best recording technology available at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder . ornstein did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the most advanced recording technology at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the tape . he used a very primitive tape recorder , which wa very primitive , but he did use this technology to make his recording because he knew that the recording would give him the best sound . he used a mimeograph to make his recording , but he did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the mimeograph and the tape . ornstein wa very much a man of his time , and
0	this song rock .
1	this is a great song . i like the guitar part , and the lyric are very good .
0	this is a song i really like . the instrumentals are great . the singing is very good . the lyric are very good . it is a good song . i think there are far more good song out there that are not country song .
1	i have just listened to this cd and i know that i will be able to listen to it again and again for the remainder of my life . i love this cd and will listen to it again and again .
1	bonnie raitt is an amazing singer . i have been listening to her music for so long that i probably am just now starting to get into it . i think state of trance is a great album , but this is even better .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	i discovered this band during a trip to europe and i just love the song of this band . the song are very nice .
0	i love this album , but i do not think i will buy it . it is just not jewel best album .
0	i like this cd . it is good , but i have no idea why the producer chose to put in the song that were so bad . the production sound terrible , and the song are not very good . i do not understand why he did it . i do not like him , but i do not want to burn this cd .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	great tune-very smooth . could be a lot better if the band wa together .
1	i found this song on the internet and this is my favorite song . i would like to thank whoever put it on the internet for giving this song to me .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	this is an excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will bi will be my first choice
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i love this song . this song is very beautiful . i would like to have this song in my car radio .
0	i love this song , but i do not understand why it is not on the cd . this is the same song , but it wa not on the album . it is a better version though , so it is still good .
0	i like this cd a lot . i like the vocal on the song , and i like the overall feeling the song have , but a i said , i am not a fan of jewel music .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this song wa good , i liked it . it is not bad .
0	i think this song is great . but to be a katy perry fan myself . i think this is overrated .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i agree barbra is a great singer , but i
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this song had me a little bit nervous at first . then when i got to the end i wa really surprised . it is a good song and i like the message .
1	great music ! i love the way you guy have arranged the song . you have some very good classical musician such a steve smith , tom cappel , and steve still . this is very good . it is very hard to make a really good classical album . i am going to check out some of your other album . thanks for the great music . love this site !
0	wow ! i am not sure how i feel about this song . i guess i am glad i have this album because it ha some of my favorite song from the whole album . it is pretty simple . it is the only song on the album that i like on a personal level and this song is a perfect example . it is a love song but it is not the typical love song . i do not know what it wa , but this song just did not have it .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	this song make me feel like a little kid .
1	i enjoy listening to this song , and it is a very good song . i like the way the song is structured and the lyric are sang . this song is very different than most of the other song i have heard .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i have seen them live about three time , and this album wa the first time i really got into the band . i really liked this album . i thought their new sound went a long way to make it a good album . i wa looking for an album to get a little more of some of their old song , but the song on this one were just too far out of their comfort zone for me .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i love this song . it is a real joy to listen to . it reminds me of the song in the beginning of the movie the last unicorn . it is a wonderful song . i wish i had a way to download it , but i am not in the mood .
1	this song need to be played more . i did not use my own word . i said bastard .
1	i have had this cd for a few week now and i love it . i received it a a gift , and i wa excited to receive a new cd from my favorite artist . the song are very well written and sung and the artist themselves are very nice people . the song in this album are all very good , and it is a very good album .
1	i love all of the song and they are great rock song . i did not like the first 2 album . i thought they were sloppy and the song just were not that good . so , i bought this one and really enjoyed it . i thought they had improved a lot .

1	this album ha a really good mix of jazz and electronic music .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i do not really care for the video . i like the song , just not the video .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	so happy to have found my new favorite song ! i love you !
1	this is a very good album . it is the best album i have heard in a long time . i love that he sings about getting high , and i love how he go on and on about sex without being mean about it . i would recommend this album to people that really love metal .
0	this song wa so bad it would be hard to even make it to the top 1000 song of all time . i wa not expecting much , but the first few note were good . then the guitar solo came in , and it all went downhill . it wa so bad that i could not even listen to it again .
0	i think this song is a hit , but it is not my favorite song . i like the song though .
0	this song is the worst . i can not believe i actually even like this song .
1	she ha one of the best voice in all of music .
0	i love the song , but i think it is a little bit too much , not to mention that this song is actually from the movie dumb and dumber . but that is all right , it can be fun to listen to it , and i like it .
0	this is a really good version , but i have to say that this is the version i like the best . it is a very nice version . i have purchased the other version , but this is the only one that is really special to me . i have purchased some other version , but this is the only one that really stand out to me .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i have never really thought that buying music wa a expensive endeavor so i decided to buy this cd because it seemed to be a little more than a cd , but i wa not disappointed . this is a great cd and i love the music . i always look for classical music and this is a great cd that can bring back some memory . the only problem with listening to this is that it take me back to a very different time , but i like it and i am glad that i bought it .
1	miley really is an amazing singer and a great artist . i love this song .
1	i like this song . it ha a good beat .
1	this is a good song .
0	this song is just a cheap pop song with no substance . it ha nothing to do with the lyric . i will give you this one , but it is not the song she should have released .
1	i remember when this album wa released , i wa on the bus and playing this album constantly , it wa amazing . it is just a great album to listen to . i love the vocal . the sound quality is great . this album is a classic . it is great .
1	this is an excellent album . it is one of the best i have heard .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i actually really like this album ! i love the song , and i love the message . the song are very well written and sung . the vocalist are very well written and they have great song . i have listened to this album 4 time now , and i really like it . it is a great worship and praise album .
1	i found this cd to be very nice and relaxing .
0	i do not think i like her music much . it is not a good voice . i do not really like her style . i think she is good though , the album ha a good sound . i really like her voice . she is very talented , but doe not get enough credit . it is just a shame that she ha to change her style all the time . maybe she should look at other style and just stay in one . i do not really like the song i am listening to . i do not think i want to listen to another song by her . i do not really like her music . the album is good though . i do not think she can sing but she ha a good voice . i do not like her at all . she is just weird . she ha a very nice voice but she doe not use it correctly most of the time . i like the album though . it is good . it is very good . i like the song and i like the story , it is not bad . i think it wa very good . i am glad to get an album by her . i will listen to her for year .
0	the album wa good . the only dud is the last song so alone .
0	i love the movie . the original is so much better . there is no point in listening to this song .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this cd is the greatest tom wait cd i have ever heard . it sound like it come from the best recording studio . tom wait is amazing . he sings great . he ha an amazing voice . thank you so much .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i am a sucker for pop song , but i usually do not have the opportunity to listen to them too often . i like the song , but the arrangement is a bit off .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i can not believe this album is still out . i do not think the beatles will ever make another album again . i do not think they will ever make another album that is over 20 track long . it is just over . i think there is only one beatles song on here that i like . i can not believe that i am not sure why they put it on the album . love me do is a decent song , but they could have put that one on their next album .
0	this is not one of the best jazz album i have ever owned . i think it is better than the other two album i owned .
1	this is a very nice selection of music for an iphone or ipod touch . it is well put together and i would consider purchasing this music or just the app itself .
0	not his favorite .
1	i love it . i love that he can sing . the song is very catchy . it reminds me of i want you back by backstreet boy , and i love that . it is very cute and charming .
1	there are a lot of people who want to argue this album is unlistenable ( i disagree ) or just plain terrible . i want to ask them why they refuse to listen to the music they claim to loathe . this album is not unlistenable it is one of the best rock album of the 80 .
0	i love barbra streisand . her voice is very strong .
1	this is a great jazz album ! the quality of the material is excellent and the musicianship is top notch . all in all , i like this album .
1	this cd is amazing , it is a great cd . i love all of the song . i wa shocked when i found out that the cd won a grammy for best pop album . this is a very good cd , i love it . i love this cd .
0	i do not know what to say . i do not know why i like this cd . i do not know what to say . i do not know what to say . i do not like this cd . i do not like this cd . i do not like the cd . i do not like this cd . i do not know why i like this cd . i like the cd . i like the cd . i like the cd .
1	the live album is good . it ha a great sound quality and the band sound great live . i bought it on a whim and wa surprised by the quality . the song lonely eye is one of my favorite .
1	i really enjoy the song and the music on this cd , i like it a lot i think it would be a good christmas cd .
0	i love this song ! i agree with all the other reviews- it is a great song , but i will be the first to admit that the video make a lot more sense than the song . it feel like miley ha to do it because she is so over the top and over the top because she is so famous . i have to admit , i am a huge r kelly fan . i wa surprised that he did not appear in the video , but i am glad he did not- it would have been more annoying than i think it would have been .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	i really like the song , i love the music .
1	this is the first single off the new cd . i like the sound of it . it is an oldie , and i am not really interested in the music .
0	i am not sure if this is about a relationship between a man and his wife or a woman being in relationship with a man who is cheating on her . if it is the former , then this song is about how he is getting the best of her . it is a song about a woman cheating on her man . and it is about how she is taking his love for granted . ugh . i think those are the two thing that make this song feel like it is about a woman . ( i am not very good at this , so i do not know . i am not really sure what the song is about . ) but it is a good song . i like the song . it make me feel bad for her .
0	i love to hear this song . the most amazing song of all time . it is a great song to listen to with the sound turned down . if you want to hear a full album , buy this album . you will not find this album anywhere else . you have to listen to the whole album if you want to hear all of the song .
1	i always thought it wa kind of odd that this song wa sung by a woman . but i guess that is what i wanted to hear . this song is about a man who ha lost all hope of happiness . he say that he is a miserable bum . he ha lost all the thing that he wanted in life , he ha lost all the thing that he loved . he think that his life is over . that is when the song start . he think that his life is over , so his wife try to cheer him up . and he say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick around . and his wife say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick you around . this is a very touching song . it is about a man who ha lost all hope of happiness . he say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick . and his wife say , i have got a brand new ball to kick you around . this is a very touching song . it is full of hope and happiness . it is full of joy and it is full of love and peace . this is probably one of my favorite christmas song of all time .
0	this song sound like the movie . it is much better than the movie . the song is really bad .
1	i believe jesus love you and care about you . you have an amazing family and they are all wonderful . i believe this is a great christmas song to sing .
0	this album ha been called one of the best record of all time . it is a little bit of a stretch for me , since i have been so preoccupied with the like of nirvana , my bloody valentine , and sigur ro . but i did enjoy this one . the song on this album are all very catchy and have a great beat to them . the song have a very catchy pop-influenced beat and are great for jamming out to .
0	an enjoyable album . but the backing track is a bit too much - the string sound too good to be from a recording , and there are no real drum , so this is a bit like listening to the band playing a tape and not a band in the band .
1	i know many of the song have been covered by others , but i think none of them are a good a this . the song are so well sung and there is just something about them that make me believe they are original . i do not think i have ever heard anything like it . it is almost like being in a church choir . it is just a very special and enjoyable album .
0	this is the first time i had heard jewel sing live . her singing is amazing , and i wa amazed at her talent . i would have preferred to have seen a more polished version of the star , but i will enjoy the sound of music for the rest of my life .
0	i like it . it is great that he still make music at least . he is not elvis presley . i had a hard time with this album . it is not because of the music . i did not like the music . it is because of the poor quality and the fact that it is not worth the money . i do not know if i am getting angry with his music or just angry at the whole process . i am probably both . i think it is a waste of money and time .
1	it is a good album . it is music from the 1960s . the song are all very good . i like the variety of the song . i wa surprised at the song she wrote , i thought she would write more like the music of today .
0	i had to listen to this song over and over again , i wa so glad i did . i do not think it is going to be my favorite song , but it wa definitely one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	i have bought this cd and it is amazing . i think it is the greatest cd ever . i would give it a 5. i do not really like the song , but it is the best i have ever heard . i would give it a 2.5 .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is a classic , and i know that i have heard it before . this song is definitely a keeper . i love the way it move , the way it is sung , and the way it make you want to dance . i hope i am not the only one who think this song is great .
1	i find the song by this artist to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this is a very very very nice song .
1	one of my favorite album . even though the guitar is a little weak and the vocal are not a good a the first one , it is still fun to listen to . i have never liked the hammonds but i love this album . one of the better hammond album .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i thought this song wa pretty good until i heard this . i wa like , what the hell is this ? i think that is my favorite song on the album ! then i heard this shit . it is worse than what we are hearing from the grateful dead . it is terrible . i wa going to buy this off of amazon but i threw it on my ipod instead . i hope amazon doe not get sued for this one . i do not want to get sued . i have a lot of money invested in this company . this is what i am talking about . i wish that i had never bought it . i hate this version . i hope that amazon take the appropriate action . i hate this version a much a i hate the grateful dead .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	great !
0	i enjoy the new version of this song . i think it is better than the original version .
1	this is one of the most overlooked trance album . the only reason i bought this instead of state of trance wa because i wa really excited about the state of trance album cover , and i did not know what to expect from it so i just bought it . this album is great music . the quality is amazing . the mixing is amazing . the song choice are diverse and the song themselves are great . i really recommend this album to everyone .
1	this is a great song . i love it .
1	this album is great , i am impressed with it . i wa a bit disappointed with the quality of some of the song . i believe the original artist , allan bole , wa able to compose a few great song , but some of the other song are not up to par . i believe that the quality of the original songwriter that were used for this album is what kept the quality high . although the song are not up to par , i believe that they were inspired . this album truly is a great album to have on your ipod . the quality is good .
1	i have never bought anything from amazon yet but wanted to check it out . this album i will say is very relaxing and very soothing . the music help me to unwind and relax . i am not sure how many song i have listened to but i have listened to about 10 song . i would have liked to have heard more but i would recommend this cd a one of the best that i have had .

1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

0	the dave clark five are my favorite band of the 1980s . they are not just a band , they are my family . i have been with them since first hearing them on the album song for a new america . you could say that i have been with them since first hearing them on walking the dog . i have been with them for a long time , and i have a lot of respect for them . i think they are the best rock band of this era .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country music karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s and.mpgs from amazon - the process is easy .
1	love the beatles .
1	i love the song it is a very powerful song , very well done .
1	i just bought dc5 because i like the dave clark five . i really love the title track . dave clark 5 is the best band ever !
1	i am a big fan of the last two l7 record . i think this is a great album overall . i do not like a little too late , but i like several of the other song . i do not like the album cover . most of the cover photo are very lame . i have a hard time imagining the band in this album .
0	i am new to the artpop band and i have been listening to this song for a while now . it is still one of my faves .
1	great song , great sound quality . the sound quality is great .
1	this is a good album . i love the song and the album . i like the song and the music video .
0	the beatles are amazing , but the album is terrible .
0	i love this cd . i can not wait to listen to it .
1	i know that this is one of her best album . great song , good vocal and great production .
1	this is the longest song on the tape . i wish it wa longer . i like the dave clark five too . i think this is the second best song . i do not care much for the cover of this song , but , i do not dislike it . i do not know what the two song that are on here are . i do not know if i like or dislike them . the two song i do not know are the one that got away and the long and winding road
1	this is so cute . i love sam sparro .
1	this is very bad . i do not know how they found it , but it is so bad . this
1	dave clark five is one of my favorite .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	just because you like country music doe not mean it is better . do not go out and buy this cd . it is just a bunch of big sounding music that ha no meaning . i know if the song is really good , it will find a way to be played on the radio . but for now , it is just another cd to be bought . i do like this song . but it is just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to . it is just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to , and i will be the one who sell it .
0	this is a great album . the cover art is fantastic , and the music is beautiful . unfortunately , the cd doe not play . please do not purchase this cd . i will refund you money .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	i have always liked the guitar work and the vocal but i am not that impressed with the rest of the song on this cd . the song dance ( lovin you ) is one that never made it onto any of the cd i have bought . the other song i do not see myself listening to again . the song candyland is annoying but i do not think it would be a big deal if i did not like it .
1	this may not be all that good , or even all that good , but it rock !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	this is my favorite song of all time . the beat is so good , i can not stop listening to it all day long . i have been listening to this song for year .
1	the track selection is fine for any fan of fat waller , but this cd is for fan of the original recording . the album itself is a great collection of fat waller material , and a great way to collect together the recording that are not available in any other collection .
0	her voice is not bad . i think not bad at all . i like her voice . i like the music , the song choice , the overall quality of the cd . that is what i like here . i like the music .
0	this is an odd piece . to me , it doe not seem to have the same feel a other piece like bolero or gloria . it all feel very . modern . it ha a very clean and jazzy feel to it which is a good thing but it certainly doe not come off a classical in any way . it just is not anything i will listen to often .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	wow , this tape is amazing ! i have never heard a tape this big before , and most of these track are not available anywhere else . it is a tape that is extremely hard to find , and i have never seen a tape where almost half the song are from obscure band . there are no filler song at all , and you will find yourself listening to and enjoying every song on this tape . there are also so many different genre represented . this tape is not only a very special compilation , but it is a good introduction to punk rock and hardcore , a well a to other form of rock . i would urge anyone who is a fan of hardcore music to at least give it a listen . it is not only a great compilation of punk tune , but it is also a good way to get into this sub-culture ( if you are not already ) . the hardcore punk song on this tape are not only very good , but they are also very different from the majority of the band that are represented .
1	i love the song .
0	i like this album , i am a fan of the band , but i just think the song on the last album are better .
1	this is the best song i have heard her sing yet , and it is not even a duet with a female vocalist . i love this song .
1	this is a great cd , a i said , i have heard all the cd version of this movie , and they are all the same , it is annoying , but not a annoying a the movie
1	great song . the sound quality is great .
0	this is a great cd . i like the music .
1	i discovered this band after looking for a band that writes original music . my main reason for listening to this album is that this band writes original song that do not sound like something i have heard before . i love the use of the drum , the guitar , and the bass . the song love to love ha a very sexy sound . i would recommend this album to anyone that like original music . i really liked the other two song on the album how can i love and all the way .
1	i have had this song on my wish list for month now . i love it . i have never heard taylor other song , so i am excited to hear them .
0	first of all , i love the album , but i can not really find the vocal for some of the song that are listed in the description . could you please edit the description to make all the song mentioned on the description a vocal ? these song are awesome and i can not find them for the first time i have ever heard them .
0	i love this cd , a a whole . it is a great album and a good introduction to the grateful dead . however , i did not like the fact that the cd ha been damaged . the sound quality is not good . i will not be buying anymore grateful dead cd , and i will not recommend them to anyone . the only good thing about this cd is that the cd is in very good shape . i have listened to this cd over and over again , and it still sound just a good a the day i bought it .

0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i wa expecting a bunch of song that are not very familiar to me and i get a dozen . i do not know how i did not make this a 4 star rating . i have not listened to this album in awhile and it is great . i hope that it is an annual tradition for me to get this album and i will be very happy with it .

1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is the only piece that i have heard that i would rank lower than a 7/10 . i am not sure why it ha such a low rating . the sound quality is good . the recording quality is really good . the recording is not a clear a some others . i would recommend this to fan of beethoven . the sound quality is good . i would rank it a 7/10 . it is a good listen all the way through . i like this one a lot . there are time throughout the piece where it ha a
1	i like the cd-tape cd from the dave clark five , but for the most part it is pretty good .

1	this is one of my favorite beatles song . it is got a good melody and great lyric .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	it is an album of very poor quality
0	a live recording from a live gig . only one good thing to say about this live recording . it is very similar to a tom wait live recording .
1	this is a very good song , i like . i can not get into the whole chorus , but i like the lyric , and the arrangement is good .
0	this album suck . you have to buy it to know how good it is .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .

1	i bought this for my fiance . she is a big fan of gwen moore . she ha never heard this song and she love it . it wa worth the $ 3 .
1	it wa a good thing that i left my cell phone in the car , because i could not wait to get in the vehicle to listen to this album . i am not familiar with the music , but i know that it is popular . i wa surprised that it is a live recording , which i have never heard before . the first time it came on the radio i wa so excited , i jumped off the sofa to get the radio . i am glad that i left my cell phone in the car so i could listen to it without interruption .
0	this song suck . it is really just a cover of an old skool song . this is a cover of a song that came out in 1982. if you like the original song , then this cover is a good buy .
0	i do not know about a great dave clark five album .
1	this cd is great . i like it a lot .
1	this is a very interesting song . the video wa very entertaining and the song is a great ear worm !
1	this album wa the first album i ever bought , the beatles are amazing . i have all their album and this is one of my favorite .
0	i wa not fond of the album title track . this is another one that wa a song i had heard , but did not know what to make of . all of the song that were good on this one were on the previous album , and they were all great . i wa hoping for a new jewel album , but this wa not it .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this song is absolutely awful . it is so bad , it is downright pathetic . it is really annoying how much i hate this song .
1	this is a great song . it is energetic and ha a great message . the lyric are great , and the melody is catchy . the instrumentation is great .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i love her voice and the song is beautiful .
0	the song are great , and the album is a nice way to end a great year .
1	this is the best of the best , in my opinion . i had to listen to all of them before i could really decide . i bought this from amazon , and i wa really impressed with the quality of the recording and the quality of the cd itself . i would recommend this to all of my friend .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	it is just like putting out a tape of the same old song you have heard over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over , and then putting out a tape of the same song you have heard over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over .
1	i purchased this cd for my child and they enjoyed it . they have told me that they can not wait to play it to their friend . i bought it for my husband and a he enjoys listening to music every night . i bought it to put on when someone need an uplifting song to listen to . this cd is a great purchase . - you are the best thing i have ever done . - thank you for the life you gave me

0	i just bought this album and i am very excited . i think this album is better than the singer previous album . she is still very good , but i think the last two album have been better . i think she is not really that great of a singer , but she doe have some very good song . i have not listened to all the song yet , but i do not think there is anything off-putting . the album is a little more country , a little more rock , but i still think it is a good album .
1	i like the instrumentation and the harmony . i do not know why i do not like this song . i bought this cd because i thought the instrumentation and the sound quality were good .
1	i like this cd a lot . i do not understand why they did not just release the album in it is entirety on itunes ( since i download all of his cd ) . i do not know how long it will take to get the whole album .
0	i have enjoyed listening to the jazz and classical jazz recording of john coltrane and his contemporary . it wa also good to hear the music of frank sinatra , george gershwin , bill evans , and charlie parker . to be honest , i wa hoping for some of the older recording of the great , but all i got wa an old version of the man with the golden arm . i wa hoping for a new cd from a very talented artist . i must say , i wa very disappointed in this cd . it wa a good effort , but the execution wa lacking .
1	i recently bought this album and i have been listening to it for the last month . i really like the album . i think it is a great album . i am going to buy the rest of the cd and i know they will be even better than this album . i am glad i bought this album .

0	i thought this cd wa just ok. not bad , but not good either . i like the beautiful and praise god cd better . i have praise god on my ipod . i like the song praise god better . i can not listen to this cd all the time , but i do like it when i am in the car driving around . if i am in a big shopping mall or a concert , i have to wait till i am done shopping or listening to a concert to listen to the cd .
0	i have a question about the quality of the cd . it wa sent to me in a cd case that wa supposed to protect the cd . to me , it doe not look like the cd are protected . after looking at it , i decided to put the cd back into the mailer . when i opened the cd , i found that the case had been damaged . i am wondering if the damage wa caused by the shipping company . please advise .

1	i have never been satisfied with any recording and the sound is quite remarkable . it is quite clear , you can hear every one of the note , and you can move your head to listen to the other instrument . sound like they had a professional engineer go over the recording and made them clearer .

1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

1	i really liked this album . it is a good album . she ha a nice voice . her song are good . i like how she sings . i like the music video too .
0	this is an excellent piece of music , but the song are all very long , which make it hard to hear the individual instrument in most of the composition . the piece is a jazz standard , but i do not find the use of the trumpet to be effective , and the use of the tenor saxophone is very distracting . it is a very enjoyable listen , but i would not recommend it to anyone .

1	i love this cd . for me , it is the best of the two . very good quality . i would give this a 5 star rating .
1	i would have to say this one is my least favorite . ohearns voice is a little bland , his voice is a little flat , and his music is nothing special . the only thing i like about this song is that it is unique .
1	i love the singer and her music . this album is great ! i love the singer and her music . i hope we get to hear her on stage soon !
1	i had no idea who this guy wa , but then i decided to take a look at his amazon page . i really liked some of his song . i also thought he wa funny . i am not joking when i say this is one of my favorite , and i really liked it . this guy deserves a lot of recognition for his talent .

0	this cd is not a bad a i thought ! i still do not think the album is worth the money . the song are okay , but they do not really stand out to me .
0	this is the best jon lord album since the road to ruin , the only problem is that he ha recorded a couple of other album that are quite good . still , i have been very lucky to hear this album , and i will continue to enjoy it , because it is not a one hit wonder like most of the other jon lord album i have heard .

1	i wa about 12 or 13 year old when i first saw this song . my mother had just returned from a long trip and i wa in the kitchen doing my homework when the song came on the radio . it wa playing in a jukebox in the cafe and the lyric were about the bus ride she had taken . i never knew that the song wa about a woman , but i do now . her name wa mary and she wa the love of my life . i loved her and she loved me and i will always love her . to this day i can never find a word she did not say when she wa around me . i think she wa born on the 29th of october . i have always loved music and would like to thank whoever put this song on the internet . i think it is one of the best song ever . please someone put it on the internet !
1	this is soo awesome ! i wa born in the middle of this song , and i never knew that !

1	this is a great song . i really love the video and the song is a great ear worm !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i love this album . i just love all the song on it ! i had no idea about the album until just now ! i am so happy to listen to this album . it is amazing !
1	i like the song , but i do not know anything about these guy , but it is fun to listen to their music .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	the only thing i would say about this song is that john frusciante wa not at all familiar with the lyric . he wa trying to play off of the song . but
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i have tried to listen through all of his album , but i just do not understand what the fuss is about . i do like the first couple of track , but a soon a i get to the 2nd set , i begin to lose interest . i would go back and listen to the album again , but i have heard it so many time , i do not remember it at all . if i had to pick one album to listen to over and over , it would be this one . it is a shame that i will never have this album .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	this album is one of the best that i have ever purchased . it is great for the person that like to listen to music on their ipod . the music is very relaxing . a person can listen to these track for hour on end or just a couple of hour . the music is very soothing and you will find yourself sitting on the couch listening to the music with your eye closed .
0	this album really had a good mix of song .
1	i thought i had a copy . i searched everywhere , including amazon , and found nothing . i wa about to return it , but decided to buy it . it came today ! i love it ! this album is so amazing ! i have never heard anything like this before in music ! i love it ! you should put out this album !
0	this album feature a variety of track from the beatles early year . this song is a remake of do you want to know a secret ? it is a pretty nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a hit . it is a nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a very good song . it is not very good . it is not a very good song . it is not a very good song . it is not that good . it is not that good . it is not that good , but it is not a hit . it is not that good . it is not that good but it is not a hit . it is not that good .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	i am a fan of johnny cash and his album . i have been listening to this album since the day it came out and really enjoy it . i would like to have more album by johnny cash .
0	: i have heard all of prince album , and i am not a big fan . if you do not like him , you should not buy this .
0	i do not think you can get any worse than this album . it is not the worst album by any mean , but when you put it up against the two other album off the album , this is the best . at the very least it is one of the worst album in the hammond catalog . i will give it a 6/10 , but i do not think this album is at all worth the price .
0	this is a very rare record , it ha the band most popular track , including their most popular chart single . if you want to hear some of the song from the album , and not have to wait for the internet to download them , then this is the one to get .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .

1	i think it is time - one of our most popular single ! this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney and released in march 1964. the beatles were famous for their music , not their look . this wa the first time john and paul were able to write what they wanted to write . this wa the beatles first time to sing with each other . i am sure this song is a very personal story from john and paul . it is not a simple love song . it is a very powerful story . it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real female perspective ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real female perspective ! it is a real female perspective ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real female song . it is a real female perspective ! it is a very powerful song ! i think this song is a great song . i think this song is a great song . i think this song is very good ! i think this song is a very good song ! i think this song is a very good song that is very much like the beatles ! i think this song is a great song . i think this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney . i think this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney . it is a very powerful story ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song . i think this song is a great song . i think this is a great song . i think this song is very good . i think this song is very good ! i think this song is very good ! i think this song is a real woman song ! i think this song is a real woman song ! it is a very wonderful song ! it is a very wonderful song ! i think this song is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . i think this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . i think this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! i think this song is a great song ! i think this song is a great song ! i think this is a very good song ! i think this song is very good ! it is a very good song ! i think this song is a very good song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real female song ! it is a real female song ! it is a real female song ! this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . this song is a real woman song . this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song ! this song is a real woman song ! this song is a very good song ! this song is a great music ! this song is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! it is good music ! i think this song is a good song ! i think this song is

1	i have been searching for some simple , classic rock ballad to listen to lately . i heard these four song and fell in love . they are very different in style and mood , but they have a lot of good point . the first song is an excellent example of a classic rock ballad sung with an acoustic guitar . i found this in many different place , but this version wa the most moving for me .

1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this is a great song . it is very simple , but very nice . the instrumentation and vocal are very nice . i have not seen the lyric on the internet , but i can imagine they are very good .
1	this is a great cd and i am very glad i got it . i am not a huge fan of the dave clark five , but i wa looking for something other than their stuff . i bought this and i am very pleased . i have listened to it numerous time over the past week and i wa pleasantly surprised to find that it is a good a i remembered it . if you are planning to buy this cd you should . you will not be disappointed .
0	this song wa about keiths mother when she died . i wish that keith would get over his mother because she wa not a good person .
0	i think the song is great but it is just a song , and it doe not have a great beat or anything .
0	i really did not like the movie and the song wa the best part but it is a little cheesy .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	it is a wonderful recording of my favorite song . it ha an incredible quality . i enjoy this recording .
1	this album had some great song but i did not like the one that i love more than word . so i do not understand why there is not more song like this on the radio .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i would recommend this cd to anybody who want a good old fashioned jazz/swing type of cd to listen to .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is an excellent album . the album is very well put together in a way that make the album stand out from the rest .
0	i like the song , but i do not like the lyric . i think it is a little bit racist .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i wa playing this song on a laptop and it did not have any scratch . it wa in the cd booklet .
1	i am amazed i have never tried this one before . it is definitely on my list of to-play-when-i am-driving-and-stopped-for-gas-station . i also tried to play it on my ipod while driving , but the volume wa too quiet .
0	this is a great album . i do not think that i have discovered anything new , but it is a great collection of song .
1	i enjoy this album . perry como make great music .
0	in the 60 they were the greatest thing around . i am only 22 , but i have been a deadhead since 1972. i love the dead and i love the music . this cd is the best thing that ha happened to me in a long time . if anyone need a copy , let me know .
1	just what i wanted , a new prince album , a lot of the song are good .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this song wa great . i have seen it used in many show , but never in a live show .
0	this wa better than i expected . i really liked this one .
0	i am a dave clark five fan . i always liked their music , and always liked their first couple album . i think this is a pretty good album , and i think they have done a good job at it . the song are all good . the playing is good on some of the track , and the arrangement are good on all of them . i like the dave clark five , but this is their best album . i think this is the best dave clark five album ever .
0	i find this one of the better arrangement of the beethoven 9th . it is the opening segment from the choral prelude to the piece . there is a bit of a rubato and a few interesting change in the tempo of the choral part and there is some interesting color added in the horn .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i first heard of this band on the radio . i like the song
1	love this song . and the album ! the song is really good . the song is upbeat . but the lyric are sad . so it make it a different song .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i received the cd yesterday and have been very pleased so far .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i know it is an old song , but i love the song .
0	this is a beautiful song . the guitar playing is great . there are a few thing i did not like-the production doe sound a bit flat for my liking , but ,
0	i bought this set of recording from the record label omni . i thought that the recording were excellent , but i wa surprised that when i went to play them in my studio they sounded very dull , uninspired and lifeless . i wa told that the recording were made originally a a sound track for a film but that the recording quality wa poor .

0	i am not a fan of r.kelly .
0	the music is good and there is a lot of good song , but most of the track are a bit boring . the lyric are really good but the music is too dopey to be catchy .
0	the dave clark five are a very strong band that ha been around for a long time . this is their third cd and each time they have released a new cd they seem to get better and better . i had a problem with their previous cd , however , the cd is fantastic . the song are really good and the band is very good . i am very happy with this cd .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	i love that i can sit outside during the winter and listen to this song .
1	this song ha a wonderful message . this is for the people who will tell you i can not do anything and that you will never be successful . this is for the girl who just want to follow her dream and be happy .
1	this is a great album . i love the song i will be missing you and the song it is yours is great .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	i just love the way hasselvander writes . it seems almost like he writes his own lyric . it is a great experience . i really enjoyed this album .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	the song ha no lyrical content .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	this is a bad album , and i am not too far into it , so i dont know what to expect . this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever seen , and is not at all what i would expect from a christian album . i can not really listen to it all the way through . i would like to give it another chance , but i am not sure i can . it is a pretty dull album . i will listen to it a part of my christmas music , but i am not going to buy it .

1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

1	i really love this album ! it is so great !
1	what a great album ! it is a good mix of old and new . i am so glad that i have this cd .
0	this is one of my favorite and most popular tape . i would recommend this tape to any person who like jazz , not so much for jazz .
0	i love when i hear this song on the radio and i start singing along just to get my wife to stop cry .
0	i would give this a 5 if it wasnt for the crappy music . it play fine , but the music is not very good . the sound quality is terrible .

1	this is one the best jazz album i have ever listened to .
1	i love the band , but i do not know why they have not released a new album . i like the song a well a the other album the band ha released and would like to hear more . i hope they release another album soon !

1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i have only listened to this one once , and so far i am impressed . i love the cover !
0	this is the second time i have reviewed a tape that had just two track . i will not recommend this tape to anyone .
1	this is the best song on the cd . the music is excellent , the lyric are not , but i guess that is a matter of personal taste . the song is a good one and the music is excellent . the only negative thing about this song is the vocalist . he can sound kinda high pitched sometimes .
0	i liked the song . barbra streisand singing is very strong and the lyric are very good .
0	i can not believe no one ha mentioned the music from this movie . that is some of the best music from any movie .
1	this is the most underrated album of the last year . this album is a gem . i bought it on a whim , and i love it . the sound quality is great , and perry voice is perfect . the song are well written and have great lyric . this album is worth owning . i recommend this cd to all my friend .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this track is okay . i am not really a fan of the vocal on this album . i did not really like the overall music on this release . the song is decent , but i would have to say that the vocal are not the best part of this album . i think that this is one of the weaker track on the album .
0	i really enjoy this song . but i do not think this wa the best song to make it on the album . it is a decent song but not the best song . i do not really know what the song wa about . i just like the song . that is good enough for me .
0	i agree with the others that this is a horrible cd . i do not like it , but i do not think i would burn it . i can understand the bad song . the production is so bad that it is hard to understand what is going on . they are trying to get your attention with the good song . it is a good cd if you like the good song . it is a bad cd if you like the bad song .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i have loved this song since i heard it on the radio . it is so simple , yet so deep . the lyric are very meaningful .
1	i like the beat of this song . i like that it is a rock song . it is not a very good song though . i would change the last line though . it is a good song .
0	i have seen no negative review of this cd . i have been listening to it for more than a month now , enjoying it every day . her voice is not the best , but it is nice to hear her sing . i would not give her a 5 star rating , but she is certainly worth a listen .
0	what a waste of money ! this band name is the last thing on earth i want to hear for christmas . they have a lot of talent , but they are just not very good . i would not buy this cd , and will not listen to it or give it a second chance .
0	i got faded for free and it wa horrible . it is so bad , you do not want to listen to it .
1	this is a very easy listening cd , but the cd ha a lot of good thing . the cd doe not take itself too seriously , which is a great idea . i do not understand why they are selling it a a single cd , and they have sold over 10,000 copy . i can not believe that someone actually listens to this recording . i do not know which one is which . i do not even know which one is the best . this cd is not worth the $ 14.95 . it is just a waste of money . i would rather just send it back , a i would rather send it back and buy the next one . there are a lot of mistake , and it is very hard to understand what they are trying to say with this recording and with the singing . the singing is very bad , and it is hard to understand what they are trying to say . i do not understand why they would go through the effort . i do not understand why they would go through the effort . it is a shame . i wa looking for a song i had heard several time and , lo & behold , i found it on this cd ! a a matter of fact , i have listened to this cd several time , and i have not yet found a song i like . i bought this and the 4 previous one a part of an extensive series , and i have no idea which one is which . i do not know what they are trying to sell with this series of cd . it is a shame . i wa looking for a song that i had heard several time , and i found it on this cd !
1	this song made me feel good . it is a very good song . i love the way the song is structured and the
0	i am sorry , but this album is just plain boring . it just doe not sound good at all . the only redeeming quality of this album is the track prelude , which is a great song .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is an awful , awful album . if you do not like this band , then you are not a real person . i do not like this band . i think that they are all terrible and no one ha any good moment on this album .
1	a great song i like the lyric , i really enjoy the song i believe this is a great song i really like the music and the lyric i believe this is a great song i believe this is a great song very nice , very well sung and produced i really believe this is a great song i really like the music and the lyric i believe this is a great song i really like the music and the lyric i really like the music and the lyric very nice , very well sung and produced very nice , very well sung and produced
0	this is not available in mp3 ( for one , it is about 4 hour long so you will have to download it from elsewhere ) .
1	great site - great music .
0	i received the album today & i have to say . i am not impressed . i have a hard time understanding why i would enjoy this album . the song are nice , and the vocal are ok. i do not know how anyone could like this album . it is disappointing . i have been listening to this album since my birthday . i am guessing this is the 2nd album i have listened to in the past few week . i hope that this is not the 2nd album i have listened to this past year . i am not looking to get rid of the album , but i have to say . i am not impressed . i really do not like the album .
0	this album ha a special place in my heart . this album ha a special place in my heart .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i like this . i like the band but i do not know about the music . it is a little hard to follow . i like the song , but i think i would want to hear an album with a better band .
1	the album is amazing . very good !
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is a brilliant song i have never heard it on the radio or on the internet yet and i have never been able to find any other version of this song at all
1	this album is fantastic . this is one of my favorite album .
0	i thought sam sparro wa a rocker but this is far from rock . i am not a big fan of this song .
1	another good
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this wa a decent song , but it doe not stand out from the rest of the song in the album .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this wa the best grateful dead cd i have ever heard . it is the best grateful dead cd , period . the only con is that it is very expensive and you are charged extra for shipping .
1	i like it . i do not know why there is a whole website dedicated to it , i really like it and i do not know why there is a whole website devoted to it . it sound like a bad brandy song .
1	this song reminds me of my childhood . i love this song because it make me think about my family , my friend , and being a young adult . this song ha really been a constant that ha been a part of my life for so long . i hope everyone ha a great day and is safe .
1	i like this song a lot .
1	the beatles were the reason i discovered rock n roll . i love this song .
0	i am a huge brandy fan , so i really like her song .
0	i think lareine is one of the worst song on the album .
1	i just bought this album and it is wonderful ! i love this song and the lyric . i am looking forward to buying the album !
1	i like this , but i do not like the guitar solo .
1	this is a great way to get your kid to read .
0	i loved this album .
1	i am a bit of a fan of the song . can not really tell if it is a hit or miss , but it may be a hit .
0	i would give this album an 8/10 . i really like the song and i think that they are good .
0	i wa surprised at how much funk i liked on this cd . i did not like the piano on this cd , a it wa the same one used on i wan na be around . but the rest of the cd wa pretty good . i wish i could have a larger collection .
1	i have many song downloaded from the internet , but this is the first i have ever downloaded from one of amazon online music store . i wa given this album by my daughter , she gave it to me a a birthday present . it is a really good album . i have always liked his music , i listen to a lot of hip-hop and r & b . i love the way he sings . he is a really good singer .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	this album make me want to use this website le . i do not need another artist that ha the same voice and is out there in the music industry . i know there is a lot of talent out there , but this is it for me .
0	i wa hoping this would be a song for the age , but it is all over the place and kinda pointless . the song is not bad , but it is not a masterpiece either .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i like the movie version better than the album , because the movie version wa the best of the three .
1	i am not a huge prince fan , but this is a prince album . the beat are great , and the vocal are great , and the arrangement are great . i like the beat a lot , and i like prince . this album is great . i just wish that prince could sing on it , because at first i thought he would . then he did not . i did not expect prince to be able to sing on this album , and i wasnt
1	i am not surprised at how much i have enjoyed the work of this very talented lady . i think she is very underrated and her voice is one of the best instrument to play . her voice is unique and very beautiful . i have played her music many time .
0	this wa one of the first album i ever bought . i feel like i am missing out on some great music .
0	this jon lord album is a great album . i like the first half of the album much more than the second half of the album . the first half of the album is very good , the second half is good a well . i like the album .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	well this album is not bad , it is just not great . this is a good album if your looking for a good album and you can not find that on a lot of them . i mean , there is nothing to be found here , or at least not from what i have heard .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i love this song , i really do . it is just a really fun song . it is a really sweet song , and it really make you want to dance .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	ah yes this is the song . i have just listened to it twice . it is fun and catchy . i am not a fan of this album but i like the music video . i hope this album is good .

1	this set of cd is a must have for anyone who enjoys classical music . the track are perfect .
1	i love window phone
1	i love this cd ! i have bought many cd from tom scott and i have found this one to be the best of them all . i would give this cd a 7 .
0	i bought the single from this cd to give to my friend who is a big beatles fan . however , when i got it i wa very disappointed . i did not like the song on this cd . the song are really over produced and i do not think any of the song are very good .
0	i can not believe he is not touring anymore . he wa a legend in his own time .
1	great , great song , i will buy it again and again . i have a friend who also love this song .
1	i really like this song . i enjoy listening to it and singing along .
0	i found this cd to be very repetitive and stupid .
0	my iphone
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	my sister love this song . we were in the car on a rainy day and she asked me to sing this song . i wasnt sure how i felt about it , but i started singing it and decided to sing it for her . i also watched the music video for it . i think the lyric are very good and the music is beautiful . i do not have a lot of faith in this cd ability to inspire me , but i like it a lot .
1	i have heard of this album several time before , but it is still excellent
1	this is one of my favorite song . i am glad i bought it . it is a very happy song . i like it all the time .
0	i like their music . i like the way they play . their music is good . i like the way they play . it is good to hear a band you like . there is a lot of music out there . you have to be able to pick out some good music . i like the sound of this band . i like the sound of this band . i like their sound . i like their sound .
1	this song is a good , honest song .
0	this is a great song . i hear it a lot . i love the lyric and the message of love .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i love this album , for the most part . the song are great and i think they are the best song in his career .
1	this song is a tribute to the band that introduced me to jazz . at first i wa drawn to this album , and i remember thinking that i wa in for a treat , but that wa before the jazz singer or a night at the opera came out.i have since listened to many of their album , but all blue is the one that stand out.and i am not just talking about the music , but the lyric , too . the opening line of the album is in the old day we used to walk out in the night and listen to the blue . and the blue , for me , come in the form of the instrumentation that i enjoy the most , drum and bass . when i listen to this album , i am really not just listening to the music.i can almost envision myself and the band playing on the street of new orleans in the 1930s . i am also a big fan of the blue , so it is kind of fitting that i have this album in my collection .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this album is a great listen . the only dud is the last song so alone . i think the album is worth the listen .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this album is pretty good . i mean , if you like prince , you will probably dig this .
0	i think this group is really underrated . their music is incredibly fun to listen to , and this cd is no exception . it is very easy on the ear which is a good thing .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this recording wa one of the better leonard bernstein recording . i really enjoyed it .
0	i love love this song . it is one of the best song ever made . it reminds me of being young , and just want to be happy .
1	i am not a fan of the weeknds starboy album , but this single wa a good one .
1	this album is awesome
1	this is a very good song . i have played it quite a few time and the crowd always love it .
1	this is the best album i have ever heard . i love the way the track are put together and the sound of the music . it really make me feel like i am in a room with a group of people who are all so talented and great that they can put together music that is so beautiful , full of harmony , and full of life . i love this album so much . you need to get it . it will change your life . i did not even know keith wa involved until i heard this album . you need to get it .
0	i am a huge fan of r.kelly . i have listened to his album ( at a much slower speed ) because i know he still ha more to come . if you are a fan of r.kelly and you enjoy his music then you will enjoy this cd .
1	it is very simple and very short , a good example of a good song . it is the only song on the site that i listen to everyday . i would prefer a bit more variety on the site though .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i love you . love you .
1	i had to skip the first 15 minute , but from the beginning it is easy to get hooked on tom scott . good music , good vocal , and an interesting , unusual story . you can not help but smile when listening to him . what a wonderful gift he ha given the world . enjoy !
0	cd wa excellent . i will give it a rating of 4 star . i am happy with the song selection .
1	this is my favorite song of all time !
1	i downloaded the download for my friend and family to sing it . they all love it .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i really like this song . i think it is great . it make me feel good .
1	not a bad cd . it is just that the producer production is so bad . i can not even understand what he is doing . i do not know why he doe it , but it is not good . i am going to burn it
1	this wa
1	this is a great album . i wa disappointed that i had to listen to the entire disc . this is definitely worth the price of admission . great lyric , great music , great performance . i am looking forward to seeing this band on tour . i have seen them in the past and the crowd wa huge ! i saw them during the first time this band played a stadium tour . that is how the concert wa made to be a big deal . they are still a great , hard working , great band .
0	the best album by bonnie . she is one of the best singer in the game .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i bought this album almost a month ago , and i have been listening to it on and off since then . it is a great album . the song are easy to sing along to and i love the sound quality .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is one of my favorite album of the year . i love the way the melody interact with each other . it is very hard to put in word what make this album great .
0	this album wa a bit disjointed . some were great and some were just plain bad , but i must admit i am a fan of the band a they have made some of the best rock music i have ever heard . some of the song are great , some just plain awful .
1	i bought this cd for my two daughter and they loved it . they both love listening to music . this cd is a must have for their music library .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	just purchased this cd . i wa really excited to hear it and wa looking forward to it . once i heard it , i realized i should not have . the singer sound like an eight year old and the sound quality is horrible . i can not stand it . i am glad i have my copy . it is much better to listen to in the car . the quality of the cd is so low that i can not even enjoy the sound . so i am sorry to say , you should check it out once before buying it . it is a waste of your money .
0	i really enjoy the music on this album . the song are very good . the backing track are good too . i like the album .
1	this is a collection of recording of the music and the brain , which wa made by the musicologist alan lomax in the 1920s . it is important to note that lomax wa a very successful musician who composed a lot of piece and that he wa highly regarded a a composer . i am not sure that lomax wa the best recorder for doing his recording , but he wa a very good musician . when he did his recording he used a primitive record and player called a cylinder . he used very little reverb and very little dynamic range , which resulted in a good sound . he used a very primitive audio amplifier to amplify the record and he used a very primitive tape recorder , which recorded to a very small capacity tape . lomax had a very poor grasp of sound engineering . he did not have a sound engineer , but he did have a sound engineer for his music . for the recording of the music and the brain he used the best recording technology available at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder . he used a very primitive tape recorder , which wa very primitive and very primitive recording technology . he did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the best recording technology at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder , but he did use these technology to make his recording . the recording are not very good because he used the best recording technology available at the time . the recording are very interesting because they are not very good because of the poor recording technology used by lomax . lomax had great respect for his work and he used to say that he wished that he had a recorder that recorded to the best tape technology at the time . lomax wa very much a man of his time , and he used the best technology available during the time that he recorded his work . he did not have the best technology available at the time , but he did have the best technology available at the time .
1	i am not a big fan of the dave
1	the album is full of good song . i enjoy all song from the album except one that i do not like .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	this song sound very nice , and ha a positive message !
0	she is a good song writer . she can do more than she did in past album .
1	steve mors solo on this album is one of the best solo on an early jon lord album .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i like this album . it ha a lot of good song . i like the way that it is mixed .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	wanya is a very talented songwriter whose tune are a fresh a his mind . this one is a great example . like many of his song , it is a mixture of soul , funk and r & b. the melody is very simple and yet very memorable . it ha a great beat , great lyric and great instrumentation . i love it !
1	i have read this book twice and wa hooked the first time . the second time , i wa surprised with the book . the third time , i started from the beginning . this book is amazing ! i loved it !
0	i love her voice on this cd . i would have preferred it if her voice had been better .
1	i wa a big fan of the song , but i have since lost it . it is a shame because i love to sing along with it .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	the lyric are great and the music is great . it is a good cd but the album is too short . the lyric are good , the music is good and it ha a good message and good vibe to it all . i am glad i bought it .
1	i have been buying a lot of cd lately because i am broke . this review wa very helpful .
1	great song .
1	this song really make you feel calm .
1	this collection is a must have for all fat waller fan . he wa always a favorite to many . his music wa truly inspirational to so many people , and i am so glad that universal is continuing his legacy by featuring his work on cd .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	it is difficult to say , but from what i understand , this album is pretty good . it is not the best prince but it is ok. i would say if you are looking for something that you can listen to while doing something ( like walking around the house/yard/etc ) this is a good choice .
1	i have never heard this concert , but i am a huge fan of prince . i wa very excited to get this cd because i had heard about it for so long . this is not a perfect recording , and i do not think it is the best sound . what is it like to have people who are screaming and cheering in the background ? how about the crowd noise or the people in the background ? it is really hard to hear . what is it like to put this on after a concert ? i would have paid good money for this . i got it for free . i do not think it is the best version , but it is very good . i would give it a 5 star rating .
1	i really love this album . i have loved all of them since i first heard this album . i love this album .
1	i love the song .
0	this song is fun and catchy . i like the music video .
1	this compilation is excellent . the track are all excellent , and the sound quality is excellent . i have heard disc with better sound quality , but this sound better than most . i had to turn the bass up on one of the track in order to hear it properly .
0	the opening track on the beach is really nice , and a great way to start an album . and it ha some great guitar and drum work for added effect .
1	bruno mar single a-yo . is simply a great song .
1	this song reminds me of my favorite brandy song . i love it .
1	this is the only live album i have had that i have listened to for day at a time . i am a big fan of live album and this is a good one . i bought it on a whim and wa not disappointed .
1	i like this cd , but it is just a really long song .
0	the music is very cool . i liked the song . i like the song . it is good , but not great . it is not a great song , but it is not bad .
1	i am sorry is a very sad song . it is about a man who is unable to love his woman . he spends his life trying to show her he love her . he miss the time they spent together and he try to make it up to her by giving her gift . he also try to make her feel good by singing to her . he doe not succeed , because she is a liar . she doe not know how to love him back . she doe not know how to love him back . she just want to be loved . she just want to be loved . she feel she should be loved , and she can not .

0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	this is one of the few song that i like . the other song i like are all my loving by bonnie tyler and i have always been crazy by elvis presley . i feel a though this song is not a good a them . it is hard to write a song when it is too easy . that is why i wrote this song . it is a very difficult song to sing and i am very glad that i wrote this song .
0	this is a great album , but it tends to get boring after a while .

0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	this song is just awful . this album is just the same way but not a bad . i would not be able to listen to the album a it is . it is like a bunch of song were put together to make this single . it is boring and i just do not feel like i would like any of them .

0	this is the first cd i have ever purchased on amazon , and i am glad i did . the song are fun and full of entertainment . i like the fact that you can download them so you do not have to waste cd . you know , when you have to buy a cd for you and a friend , you do not want to have to waste cd !
0	this band wa the first to come out with a live album . their live album is also an excellent recording . they have a great live show . this album is better than their live album . there are some song that are better on this album , but other song are just a good . this band need to do a more live album , but i do not mind if they make a new album with the song from this one . i mean , there are some song that are better than the song from their live album , but they just do not have a live album . i do not know why they do not just do a live album , since their live album is so good .

1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	this is an excellent album . the song are very repetitive but the album is worth it . if you are looking for a good album to listen to , this is it .
1	a+ this song is a perfect compliment to the band first two album . i love how the song just kind of start , and just build and build from there . it is not super heavy , and it doe not really have a hook . the first four or five time i heard it , i could not really sing it . but after i heard it a few more time , i really started to love it .
1	this is a very good album . the song are very good .
1	is there anything better than listening in the car on a long drive ? this song is great . it is just a really great song . i am not really a fan of the lyric , but i love the overall message of the song . i would have loved to have seen this version of the song featured in the movie the lion king back in the 90 , but i guess that is just not gon na happen . i will just have to listen to the same song over and over on the radio . ah , well , at least it is a great song .

0	this song reminds me of the grateful dead .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	this is an amazing song . i can not wait for the reprise .

0	this is one of my favorite album . i bought it because i love the way it sound . it ha the best song on it . i hope this is the last cassette i ever buy .
0	this is a pretty good song , but i would like to see more vocal from tom wait . not that i do not like the song , but in the past , he ha been very soft and smooth . i like the sound of the music , and the fact that it is a tom wait song . i like tom wait , but i would like to see more vocal in his music .

0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i like this song . it is not a country a other song i have heard , but it is not country either . i like the harmony .
1	i wa very happy with this app . i would recommend it to someone else .
0	this is amazing and the best compilation of ansermets recording i have heard . it is better than most record of the same and the sound is fantastic . the best thing is it is all here and not on a cd . the playing is fantastic for the most part and the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined the experience for me .
1	it is the best album in year . it is the best album of the last decade . it is the best album of the past decade .
1	just received my cd in a cracked case . the cd wa fine , just opened it up and it wa fine . this is one of the best cd that i have received . the cd is very clear and ha a nice sound . this cd ha a nice sound to it . i can not wait to listen to it .

1	i really like this album . i like her voice and the song are nice . i like the fact she doe not try too hard to impress anyone .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	the first cd contains many song by the beatles and other artist . i have listened to a couple of these and found them to be interesting . but , they are mostly filler . i think this is a good compilation for those who are in the market for a cd with great song .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this song really caught my attention the first time i heard it . i liked it then and now and hope it will make it onto your album .
1	i just bought the prince album this is it , i have never heard him singing live before and i wa very surprised by the quality of this recording . it is great , sound just like the record i used to buy a a kid . great album .
1	this band sound awesome ! the vocal are the only thing that is a concern , but the music is very good . i love this album . i had a hard time hearing the vocal on this album , but once i did , i realized i wa hearing what i wanted to hear . i really like this band and this album . i am going to buy this album again , because i love this album .
1	this is a very good live album . the cover wa a little weird , but the sound quality is great .
1	i love the music . it help me to relax and get into a good mood . it is simple and great to listen to in the car . i will definitely purchase this cd .
1	i bought this on my birthday . i thought it wa a great song . i did not expect it to be like the song i have heard . it wa good , but not a good a the song i heard .
1	i like this song . this song is a good representation of how i feel about the artist . i also like the fact that it is a free download . at this time keith is still a good artist and i would like to see him continue to be a voice to be heard . i want to see him grow and succeed .
1	this is a masterpiece of the past year , a classic to be sure . i think you will be pleased - i think you will be pleased - i think you will be pleased
1	the lyric are a little long but it is good for the price .
0	i am sorry , but this is a non-believer . this is a very typical christian song . it is the kind of song that is played at the beginning of all church service . i would think that it would be fine for a secular church service . it is only because i am a christian that i do not like this song . this song is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very .
0	that is a nice little song . it is very good .

1	i really like this album ! i love the song m
1	this is the best song on the album . it is the best song from this album . i like it a lot .
0	i am a huge fan of this guy . i loved his song the perfect kiss and i have to say i am blown away by the quality of his new music . the song is awesome and it is a great song . this is a great album . the only thing i did not like is that the song wa not on the cd or cd cover . it should have been .

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	karajan played what wa probably his last concert in toronto , canada . he wa 82 .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i like the song but it is not very good . the lyric are not that great , and the song is not very good . the backing melody is annoying and i hate the way the song is played . it sound like a bunch of kid shouting at the top of their voice . it is just annoying and terrible .
0	i love when they do this song . it doe not get old .
1	i love the music on this station .
1	tom scott performs on guitar world in a duo with jeff beck , which is a surprise . it is a great track and a great tune . tom scott put out his own cd and he release them at least once every year . so , it is

1	i wa pleasantly surprised at how much i liked this cd . the
0	all the music is pretty good , but i really like those two guitar track . and i have to admit , i am not overly fond of the vocal , but they are not bad . this album is available on amazon a a download , but i would have to say download , but do not buy ! the only reason i can not put it on my amazon wish list is because i do not want to add more than 200 track to my to read list .
1	this is a great album , well produced . it is worth a listen .
1	the album is great . i have heard a lot of praise and worship album , but this is by far my favorite . the song are not over rated , but they are very good . i love the song heaven door . i think the worship music genre ha a new meaning . i know the lyric to most of the song are not what you would call scripture , but it doe not matter , because what is good enough for god is good enough .
0	it is a digital download . the product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i have heard the pistol annies version , so i will be using that version . all the other song i have heard are the clean version .

1	one of the most underrated sam sparro song . i have listened to this song so many time it is a pain to listen to it . i like the production , but i like the song too much to go to the trouble of writing a proper review . i have no quarrel with other reviewer for recommending this album , but i do not like the way this album sound .
0	this song sound like she is about to take her clothes off , but nothing happens . it is a boring song . the only thing that i liked wa the beat .
1	i have listened to this song for almost 2 year . i enjoy it .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this song could have been a little more pop sounding . it kinda sound like a remix of my heart will go on by madonna . i mean it is just an average song .
1	i love uptown funk and i have had this album for a long time , never had a song on it that i did not like until this song . i also like how bruno mar sings in the middle of the song , it ha a nice beat and is very upbeat .
0	i really enjoyed the music on this album . i thought this album had a lot of good stuff . it wa very enjoyable to listen to .
1	i love it ! i found it to be a really good song . i really love the lyric and the voice . i just love this song . i would like to know if a different artist wrote and sang this song . i would give this song five star if i could .
1	this one is a keeper . i love this song .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i love this song
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i bought the cd for my niece . she loved it .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	you can tell the recording wa done on analog tape . it sound great on the album .
0	i wa only able to get this album for a couple of day before it disappeared . it is not a great album , but it is still a pretty good one .
0	i love the song , but i am amazed that the singer can sing it ! he wa not a good a the other one i have heard ( i have heard them all ) .
0	i like this album a lot . i like the dave clark five a lot .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i have a question for you . if you want to buy music , can you buy a cd with the same track , or do you have to buy each cd separately ?
1	you will have to listen to this cd to see what it is about . i have not heard it and i do not know what a pulpit is , but i love it . i think you will like it too .
1	i recently bought this cd . i have been into jazz for about 5 year now . i found tom scott on amazon and i am glad i did . i had heard his music before but never really listened to it . i would like to say that i am a fan of his .
0	the song is just okay , and i really like the rest of the album , but i am not a huge fan of this song .
1	i started taking piano lesson when i wa in the 7th grade . i wa a good student , so i practiced for a lot of hour . my parent were not very supportive , but they did put a lot of effort into my lesson and i owe them a lot .
1	this song wa written in 1984. the lyric are very uplifting , the music is very relaxing . the song ha been covered by other artist a well . i think this song is very important in our culture . it is important to stay positive . i think it is important to stay positive . i think this is a great song .
0	if i could give this album 3 star , i would . i have to say that the first 4 song are on the cd . i am sorry , but this album wa a little short for me . i am disappointed , and i will probably never listen to it again because of this . i would like to know what happened to the cd , but it is too late . i will just wait to hear it again and maybe give it another chance .
0	i am currently playing this song on my ipod .
0	i can get this cd to play on my ipod . i have tried four different ipod and none of them can get this cd to play .

1	i have read over 20 review on this album and i think i have to add a few more to them . this album is a must have ! i can not believe i have waited so long to buy it . i have listened to this album for the past two day and i am already having trouble picking a song . i have also listened to it in my car the other day and it is the same thing .
0	r.kelly is a great musician . i find myself listening to his music more and more . he ha a very unique sound . i would recommend this cd to everyone !
1	a very good recording , very well played , just right , with a lot of interesting and complex material .
0	i had no idea this wa even a real song until i read the lyric on amazon . i guess i am not the only one . this is a real song . david lee roth is a real singer . it is about a woman who is being raped , and the two men responsible are going to go to jail . i do not know how this is going to happen , but it is happening . david lee roth sings about being a rapist , and his victim are going to have to pay for their sin . i can not believe this is real , but it is . for all the wrong reason . it is even worse than it sound . i do not know if i am going to order this from amazon or wait for them to update it . it sound like it is going to be a good song , but i just do not believe in it realness . i am not sure why they put this on here . i guess i do not like david lee roth , but i do not like the way this is being sold online . it is a real song , and i am glad it is here .
1	it is hard to pick a favorite from this album . i listened to some of it and liked some more than others . i am glad she is back . i am sure she will be remembered .
1	this is a great punk rock album . the song are very short , and there are not a lot of song on it . the first song that i heard wa t.s.o.l . the lyric to this song were written by david lee roth . they were originally written a t.s.h.o.l . this song is from his self titled album , but this album is a different style of music .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i wa pleasantly surprised by this album ! jewel wa great on this cd , and i wa glad to see her back with another album . i wa very much looking forward to this cd , and i am very happy that i got it . i think this album wa a little better than the first , but still not great .

0	i love this new cd . it is a great collection of song . the one song i did not like is the first one . then i just went to the rest of the cd and liked it . overall , it is a very good collection of song .
1	i received it and played it , and it turned out to really suck . i really liked the song , but i am very disappointed with it . it is a cd of a concert . it is a concert of the song my way by james brown . the concert wa for the artist james brown . the concert wa at the national shrine of the black madonna in cincinnati , usa . i have a friend who saw it and told me . i would have paid a lot more for this cd if it were on the original list of cd i ordered . i am not sure why i did not notice this . i would have paid a lot more to have this cd if it wa on the original list of cd i ordered . i am not sure what is going on . i ordered this cd and thought it wa the cd of all the song by the same artist . it is not . it is a concert of the song my way by the artist james brown . i do not remember ever buying this cd . i am not sure why it wa on the original list of cd i ordered . i would have paid a lot more for it if it were on the original list of cd i ordered . i think this is false advertising . i could be wrong
0	this is the first karajan recording i have ever heard . i wa hoping for more of the same , but ala . the piano playing is very good for the time period , but the singing is not . karajan sings with a high voice and a low voice , which make it difficult to sing along with him . he also make mistake in the lyric , which can be heard and the listener can not help but point them out . i have heard many recording that sound like this , and i usually do not like them . when i had this album i did not like it , but i like it now .

0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !

0	i have always preferred mike varneys work over his work with mike v. i wish the mike v album wa more like this one . i do not like the way it is arranged . the ballad are nice , but the song were too long and the guitar playing wa not good .
0	i am a big fan of r.kelly and this song is a must have for everyone to hear !
0	i wa very impressed with this song .
0	this is the only cd collection i have ever seen that really ha all of the great performer i have been looking for . i am so glad i gave this collection a try . it may be my new favorite cd and it is definitely worth the money .
0	this song ha always been played in my band show . i also have seen it used in a lot of show and the crowd love it .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	it is the same song , with the same band , and it is not the same song . it is a live version of the song .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

1	i would reccomend this cd to anyone who is looking for a good , good cd .
0	the only thing that i did not like wa the ispecial edition that included the music of the film skyworld . ( i saw the movie , too , and it wa amazing )
0	this is a horrible tape that i will never recommend to anyone .
0	i like the music of this band , but i am having trouble connecting with it . i like the production and the sound , but the lyric are a bit of a stretch for me . i do not know that i could say that i relate to the music , but i do like the lyric . i like the music , but i do not think i could live out that lifestyle . i am a pretty private person , so the music doe not really do it for me .
0	i do not think miley is a drug addict , but she need to stop lying . i do not think she is a drug addict .

0	i never ordered this cd and i do not know why you wrote this review . this wa the worst cd i have ever bought and i would not have bought any of your cd . i hate all your cd .
0	i have come to love jewel music . she is one of few artist who can make me feel what i am feeling through her music . i have been a huge fan of hers since her first album , the best of jewel in 1989. this cd is a very good one , but it ha a few flaw . my biggest problem is the song the one to watch .
1	i really do not know why this song is not more popular .
1	this song is so catchy ! this song is really good . i just downloaded it . i really like this song . i hope that the artist will continue their career . i can not wait to listen to this song again and again . i am really excited . i am going to listen to this song a lot . it is really a great song !
1	i love this cd , but i am a bit weary of the song . there are good song and there are bad song , but i am not sure which is which . i really like the other beatles album , but this is by far my favorite . i really enjoyed this cd , and it is a shame that it wa only released in japan . i am not sure when any of the other beatles album will be released in america . i plan to buy the other beatles album a soon a i get the chance !
1	i really do not understand why there is not anything like this on the radio . i like the cd better than the cd i got , and it is a great album .
0	her voice is great when singing along to the song , but it get monotonous .
1	i love the way he sings this song . he is so good at it .
1	this song is amazing . i think it is the best song of the year . when it wa released i wa so excited i could hardly sleep . i even wrote a blog about it . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never played this song on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio today i wa like ohhhhhh and put it on my cd and that is how it happened ! very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard this song played on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio this morning i wa so excited i could barely sleep .
1	i just love this song . i love the song , and i love the music to it . the lyric are very inspirational . i think it is a very good song .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i bought it from amazon and it wa a great christmas gift . the cd played on my ipod and the cd case i got wa defective but i still like it , it is a great christmas gift .
1	i really like the song . i think it is a good song and the movie wa great .
0	it is not a bad album , but it is not my favorite either . i have to admit that the song are well written and well played , but i do not like the sound of the album .
0	the song is a little boring , but the vocal are good .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this song doe not remind of anything i know . it is like a song that is a mix between the old , and the new .
1	i have bought this cd a lot and i like it .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i have had this album for a year and a half . i have listened to each song several time . i like the oldie . i like the country music . i like it all .
0	i wa looking for this cd , but i got the cd and i liked it . i listened to the other album , but not this one . the lyric are pretty , so it is a good cd . the album ha a unique sound . the lead vocal are not what they should sound like . the lead vocal are weak . i did not like the way she sings . she is not a great singer . i love the song i am an artiste . i would like if she sang this in a different way . i want to listen to her original song . i would like to hear her sing at her best . i have heard her live , they sound great . they do not sound like the cd . they are not even close . this is a mediocre cd .
0	lareine , it is not bad !
1	i have been listening to this cd since i found it . i am glad i did .
1	i would buy this album again if i could .
0	i agree that the song are not worth listening to . the worst part about it is that the lead singer is not a gifted singer . the lead singer sings like he is a robot . the worst thing about the song are that they are so repetitive . the lead singer doe not have the ability to write his own song . the lead singer ha nothing to offer and i can not believe anyone would buy this album .
0	i think this is a good song . i do not think it is a great song . it is not a good song .
0	i like this band .
1	this song is really good . i think the band will be able to do better . i like it .

1	this is a very good song . it is just sad . it is just sad but it is also very beautiful . this is a very good song .
0	this song really touched me .
0	this cd is good , but i still think it is a little too short . i love the song , but the cd is just a little too short . if this cd were a little longer , it would be a good listen .
1	i love lareine . this album is amazing . she is very talented . i have been waiting for her to release an album .
0	i actually heard this whole album once , but i did not know that there wa a video . it is a good song , but i hope she ha more video in the future .

0	i have bought the previous three album by the same band , and i hate them all .
1	i love the song , it is really good , it is my favorite song .
1	this is an excellent album .
0	i really wish i could download this cd . it wa a waste of my time .

0	her voice and arrangement are alright , and the song are good . nothing special .
1	i do not know why i like this one , i thought it wa boring .
0	mileys voice is very good ! i like the song .
1	i wa looking for a prince album on the iphone and stumbled on this album . it is one of the better one i have downloaded and it is well worth the download . however , i wa not pleased with the album overall , it is not the same song a the one in the movie , but it is a good song nonetheless .
1	i have to say , i think this is the greatest album i have ever heard . i love the song and the band . i would recommend this album to anyone who like a hard rock band from the seventy .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	the cd is well-made and in excellent sound quality , but i am not sure whether i like it . the sound quality is quite good , but the lyric are not very good .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	this app is pretty good . i like the way you can view the song in a grid , or a list . it is a little difficult to use , but it doe what it doe and it doe it well .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i have to agree with the other reviewer . this is a great album and is sure to make you fall in love with the music . the lyric are great and the songwriting is amazing . i am quite familiar with the artist music and i have always enjoyed his work , but this one is different . the vocal are very nice and the album ha a great sound to it . the album feature song from several artist that are very great artist . i am a huge fan of the artist , and i enjoy listening to his music . i really hope this album will make you fall in love with this artist and his sound .
0	lyric are great , but the vocal are not . the vocal are good , but the lyric just do not stand out . they are not bad , but the lyric do not match the melody or flow of the song . also , there are too many word . there are over 100 word in the song . it is like he wrote every word on the page and then cut and pasted it into the lyric . it is not a bad song , but it could have been written better . and i do not think it wa . i think he just did not know how to write song . he is a great lyricist , but he is got to get some of those great word , and some of those great melody . it is just that he doe not have the song .
0	i love bonnie prince billy . this album is one of the best indie rock album of all time .
0	just wanted to tell you i love your site .
0	this album is good . not great . the quality is good . all the song are good . it is a good album . it is good to have song like fulfilling your faith and in the house of the lord in a collection this size . i like the selection on this album . some of the song are better than others . the quality of the song on this album is good . i like the song on this album . i do not like the song on this album . this album is better than that album from the other cd .

1	this song is a hit , they played the song at my son wedding . it is one of my favorite . this cd is very
0	this is a great album . the only dud is the last song so alone
0	this song is just plain boring . there is no melody . there are no chord . the lyric are just plain stupid . it is just a generic song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i love this set ! i love classical music . it is the best music i have ever heard . i have several set of great classical music on vinyl from the 1960s and 70 . this set is by far the best compilation i have ever heard of all of them . they are all top notch and are great for a great price !
1	i am glad my son love this a it ha made him appreciate others .
1	i love it ! it is different and it is all over the place . i recommend it to everyone .

0	i did like it but the vocal are on the wrong spot and there are too many instrument on the background .
1	i love the song . i liked the chorus , and the singing . it is a good song and i hope my kid will like it too .
1	i love this song . i wa surprised at how well the song wa received by the public . this is a very catchy song that ha a great beat and i like the video , which wa very good .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i am a little skeptical of cd . i have never been a big cd fan . but i wa told that this cd wa great and one of the best of the year . i have not listened to it yet and am still waiting to hear it . i do not know why i waited so long to order it . i thought it would be so long that i really did not want to wait so long to hear it .

0	i am so excited to get my hand on this cd . i have been waiting for it for a very , very long time now .
1	this song is awesome . it is the first song i heard from her , and it immediately stuck with me , so i bought the whole album . i also love the video , since it is quite disturbing , but still so awesome , that it is hard to not be entertained by it .
0	this album wa so good , i could not stop listening to it . in my opinion , they are the real deal . the only band i have ever seen them in concert that is able to keep up with them . i have a hard time believing that any other band would be able to do what they do . i have been buying them since i first heard them . i do not think they will stop recording and performing . i wish i could live in that time . this album will stay in my top 3 in term of greatest album of all time . this is the best album so far with any band . i am a huge fan and will never stop listening to them . i have seen them several time and each concert is a different experience . they are still going strong and have new music on the way .

0	i ordered it at the suggestion of a friend . i am not sure how it got on the list .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	this is really a good band to have on your side . i bought this album on a whim and i really enjoyed it . the music is very well written and the instrument are very well played . i am always happy to hear new band because they always have a great sound . i am really enjoying each of their album . i think they are all very good . i have the last two of their album and i really like them . i am a fan of jazz and i love the music they play . they are a really great live band . i think this band ha a lot of potential . i hope to hear more from them . i would highly recommend this band if you like jazz and want the best .
0	i bought several copy of this cd , and since then i have listened to it more than 50 time . i like the music on this cd . i love the song . it make me want to go out and celebrate .
0	this song and movie are excellent . if you love movie , give this a listen . if you love the song , then this is for you . if you do not like the song , you may find it hard to get through this movie .
1	this is the best cd in a long long time . i have listened to it a lot and i really like it a lot . it is better than uptown funk .
0	this is a great album . i bought it for my daughter for christmas . i think she is going to love it .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	she is a great singer . great voice . i like the way she sings i will be here better than the other song on the album .
1	i wa wondering what to do until i read this review . i am a catholic and i wa wondering what i would do if i were to get this cd and what my choice would be . i have listened to a few of her cd . this is the first that i have come across that i have enjoyed . i am glad i listened to her cd and took the time to look up what other people have said . i am still thinking about it , but i have decided that i will leave it at that . i do not like the music that much , but i like the message .
1	i like this cd i like the song on this cd the song are so good the dance move are so good the cd is fun .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this collection is great , but i would not buy it if it were available . it is still too rare .
0	i bought the original lighthouse version from the site . it is a great song . i also have some of the other version of this song from the site . all are great song , but this one is the best . this is an excellent version . i have listened to it on and off for the past year . i really like it .
1	i have been waiting for this cd for a long time . i love tom scott and i have enjoyed listening to him . i have been listening to tom scott for four year and i am very happy with the quality
1	this is my favorite album so far . i have a feeling that album will be even better .

0	not my favourite lorde song . but it is ok. i like the song . good song .
0	i have bought many album on amazon and never had any problem with the shipping , or the quality of the music . this time i have to say i wa very disappointed . i ordered this cd from amazon . it is a cd with an 8 disc compilation . there are 4 cd in total - and all 4 cd have the same music on them . the only difference of any kind is that one cd is a compilation ( all song performed by the same artist ) and the other 4 cd are all by different artist . the cd with all the song by the same artist is called classic . i ordered this cd and it say it ha a cd of all the song by the same artist , but i just do not recall getting this cd . i do not remember ever buying this cd . the only cd i have ever bought on amazon that i remember were cd of the same artist . i also ordered the cd that came with this cd - it wa a cd of a concert . the concert wa for the artist x. i do not remember if i bought this cd . i do not remember when the concert wa . i should probably go back and check the cd i bought on amazon . but i am sure the cd i bought all had the same artist in them . if i had to go by the description or the cd cover , i would say it is false advertising . i can not remember ever buying this . it certainly is not a cd i would have remembered buying if i had purchased this .
0	i really enjoy your music .
0	not bad , just not a great song . if you like a song that is a little different , then this is your song .
1	i like the original version way better !
0	this is the type of song i would usually gravitate towards , but it is not exactly my cup of tea .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	i first found this band when i got in my car and heard it on the radio , and i think it is a really good song !
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	great harmony super fourties group
0	for some reason , this song make me think of my grandma .
0	the one thing i would say about this album is that it is very much a throwback from the seventy . the guitar are much harder than the guitar you hear on most of the other band that came out in the seventy and the tempo is just a tad bit too slow . but overall , this album is great .
1	i have heard this song a thousand time and each time i hear it , i am amazed by the way the guitar make the song sound .

1	a must have trance album . it make you feel good , you will never forget this song .
0	a very good collection of ornettes best song , and is the best collection of his material yet . the only bad thing is that it took me a long time to get to listen to all of the song . there are only 7 of them and i thought i heard them all . i am very excited to listen to the song . i have the entire collection on cd and cassette and i think i would have been disappointed if i had gotten this collection on cd . i have the cassette . i am trying to figure out how to listen to it without cassette tape , but i think i will just have to sit down and listen to it on cd . i have listened to a few of the song and they are all good .

1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .

1	this is another great worship song .

0	this song just suck !
0	i have been a fan of r.kelly for a long time now , but this is something different . it a very different album than anything i have heard before , r.kelly is singing about a lot of different thing that you would never really associate with r.kelly .

0	we are all going to die and i would like to hear something i can listen to that doe not make me want to kick somebody in the face . i believe love is the greatest gift of all . it is not a curse . i think if we had the real mccoy and we really loved each other , it would make a huge difference in our life . but i guess that is a pipe dream .
1	one of my favorite song of all time . this is the best album on this list . one of my favorite song , and i would not change it for the world .

0	i have never heard of this album . i believe this album wa made by the beatles . i believe it is their last record that they recorded at abbey road studio with just paul singing . i have not listened to any of their album . i am a beatles fan , but this is my first beatles album that i have ever heard .
0	i downloaded this album to try it out . it work great . i can not believe how much these song sound like the movie music . the album is amazing . i played all of the song and i really enjoyed them . i would definitely buy this album one day .

1	i am one of those people who is not really a fan of the music released by the current pop star . i have always been a fan of pop music with a little bit of country in it . this album ha just that . it is a good mixture of both . i like it . i like the song . i think it is nice to have an album to listen to while you are driving or doing something you normally would not do while listening to pop music .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	i have a hard time finding good music anymore , but i always buy her album .
1	this is a great song . the song is very catchy . i really like the chorus . it will be on my playlist for a long time .
1	beautiful , but not the same a the original . i got this because i wanted to buy a cd with an original recording of one of my favorite artist . i am not disappointed . the album is well thought out and the arrangement are beautiful . the only thing i can not stand is the music . i have to turn it off . i liked the first one , but this one is just a little bit too much . i would give this one a 5 star review if i could . i recommend this album . this album is really beautiful . i like the arrangement . i would recommend this album to anyone who like beautiful arrangement . i really like this album . this is a beautiful album . i would recommend this album . i really like this album . this album is really beautiful . i really like the arrangement . i would recommend this album to anyone who like arrangement .
0	i think she sound better at the end of the song . i just can not get into it at the beginning of the song .
1	i have enjoyed jps music for a long time now . i like the guitar solo on the last night .
1	i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this album sound like all of the best song on the other album , and the album is boring . i do not like this band .
1	i listened to this album a lot . i liked it , but wa very surprised that i liked it .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	this is a great album . i have had it for several week and have listened to it several time . it is a very good album . i am sure that tom wait will continue to have a career with his music . his music is unique and ha a very personal touch to it .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i love this song ! it can be heard in so many different place . it is positive , yet sad .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this song make me cry .
1	the best song on this album
1	this song brings back so many memory . i think i love this song .
0	i am a big fan of maria . i love everything about her . i think she should get more recognition . maria ha always been underrated and under-appreciated . she can sing , she ha a beautiful voice and she is talented in all she doe .
0	this cd contains the best song thedave clark five ever recorded in their three-decade career . they were one of the most influential jazz vocal group . they blended a lot of great music and sound with their own unique talentand style . the dave clarkfive were one of the most important jazz vocal group to ever come out ofthe new york city area . they were very versatile , but they were always at their best on theballads and love song . the dave clark five wa the original band that played the song of the era , including several of the biggest hit ofthe era . this cd contains song that are part of the dave clarkfives entire discography . i highly recommend listening to this set to fully understand the dave clarkfive and the legacy of the dave clarkfive .
0	i would like to say that i like his music , but unfortunately i am not so sure . i have heard them , and i have listened to most of his song but i do not like his singing voice . i listened to this song and thought it wa great , but i would like to know if anyone else can say that they like this song .
0	i bought this cd because i had seen the song you had on your site and i thought it wa really good . i have been a fan for a few year now , and i really enjoyed listening to it and i thought you guy would enjoy it a well . i am glad i bought it , and i will purchase the other song you have on your site .
1	i love the song so much it give me chill every time i hear it .
1	this song is about god revealing his love to his creation and bringing u to worship him with all our heart . this song is very moving and this is why i love it so much .
0	this is the only version of the song i have heard , but i am not sure i would buy it . jim
1	this album is a really good album to listen to . although it sound like a typical power ballad , there are some good song on this album . my favorite song on this album is a new kind of love . the song ha a lot of different instrument , which is nice . it is a great song , and i like it because it is very different from the rest of the song on this album . a new kind of love is a very good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a date , and he doe not know what to expect . the vocal on the song are a little too high for me to enjoy it , but it is still a very good song . you do not know me is a great song about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not really know how to get it . there is a great song on this album , but the vocal are too high for me to enjoy it . the great pretender is a good song about a man who want to be a famous actor , but he can not get a job until he get a job . the vocal on the song are a little too high for me , but it is still a very good song .
0	i just downloaded this cd . i have heard it is a catchy song , but this is very bad . it is very annoying to hear . i will not recommend it to anyone .
0	this is the only cd that i have been able to find that deal with the situation that i am currently in . i have been thinking about this subject for over a year now and i have yet to find a cd that match my situation .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	there is a good chance that some people , who listen to this recording , will think that it sound like it wa recorded in the early 70 . they would be wrong , a it wa recorded in the late 70 . the sound quality of the recording is excellent . i also like the fact that the recording includes , on each disc , the original orchestral score of the same title .
0	i have been a fan of the band for year , and even though they were never a huge hit here in america , i had always wanted them to come back . i bought the album when it first came out , and it wa the first time i ever heard i do not wan na be the boy i will never be and i have never been able to get through it . i just can not get past the last verse , and i do not know why they never do the song in the video . this song is amazing , but it is hard to get through .
1	this is a great album , especially for the song i do not believe on the first side . this is a great album , especially for the song i am a little teapot on the second side . i just want to say that i love this album , and this is definitely one of the best album that i have ever heard .
0	the music on this cd is definitely in the blue genre . the song have a nice bluesy rhythm with a lot of harmony and good guitar playing . and the vocal are a nice blend of blue , country and pop style . it is a nice change from the usual rock and roll i am used to . but the cd doe not offer much to choose from . this ha been out for a while and i have heard quite a few different version of it so far , i would expect this to be a hit or miss cd .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	tom scott music is fantastic .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i am a big gnr fan , i really enjoy most of their album . they were an awesome band . i wa able to see them live in the early 80 . i hope they get the award they deserve . they deserve it !
0	too bad i do not like this album . i am glad that i did not have to listen to it . i would have given it a one star .
0	i will be buying more of her album in the future .
1	the title is shake the heaven and it is a wonderful song . it is one of those i could be on radio song .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i love tom scott . he is so talented . i like all his album and he is my favorite artist on the planet .
1	this is one of the best song that i have ever heard ! it is definitely an awesome song ! it is a great song to dance to !
0	i do not think this is a song about a woman love life . it is a song about a woman love life .
0	this is a great album from a great artist . the first time i heard it , i thought i wa going to die . i wa in a coma for 4 day . i went to the er and got the cd , and my life wa saved .
0	i have very rarely purchased ( or listened to ) a song or album that i did not find interesting . i am not sure why i am doing this now , but i am . i am listening to the new jewel album , the language of flower , and i am surprised that i found it lacking . it is not that the music is bad ; it is that there is not a single redeeming moment in this cd . it is really disappointing . and not just to me ; it is disappointing to the fan who helped her to record and release this stellar cd .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i give this album a 4 star rating because of the song . i think that it could have been a little better . i think it ha some good song that i like but most of them are just ok .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i have already read a lot about this album . i had to check it out . it is not a great album but it is got great song and it is got the right balance of style . most of the song are good .
1	i wa surprised by this album . i had heard of this artist before , but never listened to his music . i will tell you right now that this is one of the best album that i have heard in a long time . the instrumentals are great and the vocal are great . i give this album a 4 star rating .
1	this is the first album i have ever purchased . it wa on sale at target during christmas , and i ended up buying it . i think i will be buying more album after i get a car .
1	i had a great experience with this album on my hd-ma2 surround sound system . i found it to be an excellent album to listen to . i have had the hd-ma1 and hd-ma2 system and both are great . i have been listening to this album for a few month and have enjoyed every moment of it . i could sit and listen to this album for day and day . this is one of the best album that i have ever heard . i purchased this for my girlfriend birthday . she love jazz and this is a great album for her to listen to .
0	this song make me feel happy .
1	this is the most creative album i have heard in a long time .
0	i have just started listening to this cd and i love it . it is very good ! i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not pleased . the sound quality is good and the cd ha a few good song but the lyric are not great .
1	a good tune and a good cd . it wa a very nice surprise to find this on the web . i am not sure if it wa my fault or if it wa a bad copy of the cd . i am just glad i found this and i am glad the cd is not damaged .
0	this is a great album . it is an attempt to play the blue in a way that is completely non-traditional to the blue . this is not a traditional blue album at all . it is very much a jazz album with the exception that he us a very modern recording technique with the drum . it is jazz because it is not a traditional blue album nor is it a traditional jazz album . the only jazz sound in the entire album is from the drum . now , i have no idea what this guy wa playing on guitar but this is the only instrument that is used to it full potential and at this point i do not know if this guy ha any sense of what he is doing .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i am a huge fan of the dave clark five . i just love this album , but i do not like the song . i do not like most of their music .
1	i have already bought the two previous dave clark five album ( state of trance 1994 and state of trance 2004 ) . this one is a great album , with ton of song to choose from . the song wake up is one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	this cd wa so beautiful and the music on this cd is just fantastic .
1	this is a beautiful version of the steve morse classic , the hammond organ collection . if you enjoy the late 70s/early 80 , this is a must buy .
0	i bought this cd for my son . i am happy he love the music a well a i do .
1	if you love funk and funk-influenced pop music , you will love this album .
0	i did not like it . the song are repetitive and the lyric are uninspiring . i thought the song were good , but i did not like them .
0	this is an old school album of praise and worship . most of the song are very familiar and not new . the song are not very good . not worth the money .
1	love this song . it is one of my favs , and a song i will never forget . i love the video too , it is hot and sexy !
0	i bought this one and then found out that the karajan version released on cd ha been replaced by a different version , which i thought wa pretty disappointing . karajan wa a huge star in his day and the mansmusic continues to be played on the radio today , but i have to saythat this cd is not karajans best . the music is finebut the production is a bit low in themix and the vocal are often a bitmuddled . perhaps if the musicwas better recorded , the singing would be good .
1	this is an older song , and i like the track . i will go out on a limb and say that trouble is one of my favorite song ever . so , i am giving a thumb up .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is a great song , the guitar part is awesome and the harmony are awesome . the lyric are lame , the song just go on and on . very disappointed that they changed the lyric .
1	this is a great band . i love when they do these live show . this is a great band to see live in person . i love the sound of this band .
1	it is a nice tune , very short , but the sound is good and the bass is pretty good . there are some problem of course , but i will work on them . i like the simplicity of it . it is also a little on the loud side .
0	this is the version of the song that i have been enjoying on your site for the past couple of month . i have enjoyed it so much that in the last couple of week i have tried to download a number of your song , but i have been unsuccessful in downloading most of them . however , the song i am yours is available a a demo download and i have decided to try it . this song is great but the version on the demo is not a good a the version that you have on your site . what give ? i would really like to have the full version of this song . i do not get why you do not have it available . thanks for your help . bob
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music

1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	for some reason , this album reminded me of a certain song from the movie the godfather . i do not know if that is because of the music or the lyric .
0	this song is nice . i like it a lot . i can not get enough of it .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	the chicago symphony orchestra is the only orchestra i have ever heard that i would rather listen to than listen to with my wife . my wife ha heard the chicago symphony orchestra and i have never heard them sing . when i listen to this cd i feel like i am listening to the chicago symphony orchestra .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is an amazing album . i love it . i love dave clark five . they are
1	i downloaded this to improve my singing voice . i like downloading.mp3s and.mpgs from amazon - the process of downloading is easy .

0	i do not particularly like worship . i do not like worship at all . i do not really care for worship song , especially worship with lyric .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i love love love this song and i like it a lot .
1	i have been listening to this album for year . i am completely in love with it . the first time i heard it i had a hard time believing it wa really happening . my whole family wa laughing at me . i did not understand what the song meant . then i went back and listened to the album a second time and this time it all made sense .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i loved this song and i listened to the original record and i wa amazed . i have loved this song since the time i first heard it in high school . it ha been one of my favorite for year . i have never bought the cd from this site because i am not one to buy cd . i have had the song but i do not feel it is the best version . i do not know the difference between the real song and the cd version . it is hard for an adult to just listen to a song without the parent influence . i feel that a person should find the best version for him or her and not pick one that is already out . i like the music and it is what i have always listened to . i have listened to a lot of music since i wa a child and this is the best version i have ever heard . i do not know if it is the best version but i love it and it is one of the real song i have ever heard . i have listened to more music than i can remember and this is the best i have ever heard . i really enjoy this cd .
0	this is a cd of unreleased live recording by the kink that were broadcast during their time in the uk . i like this one . it is a little better than the album version . the kink were at the beginning of their career and i think this is the first recording of them at this time . it is also a good representation of the song they released a single . i wa able to hear this during their live performance in london . it is well recorded and ha some interesting song . i did not realize until i listened to it that the kink sang in harmony , which i like .
0	i am not really a big fan of this song , but i like the cover very much .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this is probably the best album i have ever purchased . it ha a bit of everything . my favorite song is i have got a feeling and i also like the other song a lot . my favorite track is i am not there and marianne is my favorite song from the entire album . the lyric on marianne are so powerful and touching .
1	this is a good song but i do not like it a much a some of the others on the cd .
1	this is a really good , beautiful song . it is a great song for a little child that is trying to learn to read . the verse is a little hard to understand , but the melody is very catchy and fun to listen to . the song end a little fast , but the song is so sweet and beautiful that you can not help but smile .
1	this is my favorite version of this song . the band ha been playing the song for year but i have never heard the original . i am glad to hear it again a it sound very good .
1	this website is a great source for music i am sure . i have found many song i never would have found .
0	not a bad cd , but not worth the price .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i have been a fan of the artist for a long time and i have never heard this artist play live . when i heard this cd , i bought it right away and i am looking forward to hearing it . it ha a really nice sound . i am looking forward to listening to the cd .
1	i saw this on my facebook feed . and i have to say , it is a great song . i am a huge fan of her music .
0	i really really like this song .
1	i am not a big fan of the beatles but i love this song . it so hard to describe the song , but it is about people who are lonely and confused .
1	i like the dave clark five album more than most because they are the first to mix rock with country . i also like that they did a lot of rock song . i have listened to this cd over and over and i have never tire of it .
0	i bought the second disc of the album . i do not recommend it .
1	a a fan of the band , this is my first time hearing the album . so if you have heard it , you have heard it all . this is an album that i will be adding to my collection . it is a great mix of old and new . there are some really great track on here . i love the thriller and rappin for the n-as single , but the other song are very , very good a well . this album will not be ignored , and it will be on my list of must have .
0	i think this is the best song ever ! if you like miley cyrus .
0	i will be the first to admit , i am not a real fan of jewel . i do not care for her music or her personality . but i love her album , which are all worth owning . i have a great appreciation for her song , and that is why i will be the first to admit that i am a very short seller with this disc . i have only listened to it once , and after listening to it for only a couple of second , i am left with a very negative , and somewhat disappointing , opinion of the entire album . so if you like jewel , i suggest you stop reading now and put this disc down , and instead head to your local record shop and pick up some jewel cd . they are all about the same , and they are all much better than this . i hope this disc becomes available on itunes , but for now , i suggest you search amazon and order this album from there . you will not be disappointed . and you will probably like a lot better .
0	i love the song . i listen to the original album a lot . i like it a lot .
1	i would like to buy this but if the cover is this cool , i will not . i will probably still buy them anyway , though .
1	i would like to recommend this site ! i have used it twice to download song to my iphone . i wa able to download song that were on my computer and not on my iphone . the site is easy to use and the quality of the file is quite good . and the file size is pretty small ! great site !
1	i am glad someone liked this tape . i would recommend it to anyone who like rock music .
0	it a very nice song , but i am afraid i will not buy the album .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .

1	the app is great and make a nice way to read to child .
0	this song is a very good song , but i am not sure the vocal are what make this song , it is the beat . it is good , but i can not say the vocal are the icing on the cake for me . it is a good song , and a good version ( for being an old classic ) .
0	i really liked this album , and the song is so bad that i would not want to have it in my car .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	it is very good but i think i will be going back to the old jvj album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i have listened very patiently to this cd but i have yet to hear it . the only con is that it is very expensive and you are charged exhorbitant
1	i love sam sparro and his music . this song is great . i think sam sparro will love this song a well . it is a great song .
1	i think i will buy this song and the video .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i like kiss more than anything else but it ha a very bad melody . i think it would be better sung by a male or female singer . the song start with an out-of-key guitar riff which is annoying . i do not know what it is trying to say , but it is just not good . i would give it a poor rating , but i am not sure how to rate it .
0	i liked this song . it is catchy and pretty simple .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	this is for the person who want to hear something loud that is not bad .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	it is a very good album , but the lyric are very offensive .
1	this song is a great song , this is the second song i have downloaded from amazon . i have listened to a lot of song and this is one of the best !
1	this is a very good , but not great , collection of the most famous christmas song in the world . the song are in good pitch and have a good tempo , but i wish there were more song . i do not know why some people think that the song in this cd are better than the one in the previous cd , but i do know that there are more song , and that the song are better sung . the vocalist are all exceptional .
0	this is not a good album at all . it is not the sound , but the fact that it is from the 50 . that is all it is good for . i have listened to a few other album from the 50 and even those are worse . this album is not worth the money , imo . i am sorry that i lost $ 150.00 . i would like to give it one star so i can complain more about it . this album is not worth the money , imo .

1	very good song .
0	i like the different type of music while i am driving . i did not know that there were different type of car in the world .
1	the dave clark five are one of the most popular and important jazz band of the 20th century . their music ha been sampled in everything from britney spear oops , i did it again , to the original soundtrack of the movie hairspray .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this disc is great . i would recommend it to anyone for a fun and nostalgic album .
1	this is a very nice version . i really like it . it is great when you listen to it a an entire piece .
0	i saw last night broadway production of fiddler on the roof . it wa a very good show , but i wasnt able to get into it . it wa very very slow . the production of the show wa a mess . it take a long time to get into the show . the actor are very good , but i thought the show did not move very well . i hope they fix it soon .
1	i love how there are different song on this album . some of them are really good , and some are not so great . some song are very catchy , and others are not so catchy at all . the album is full of good song , and that make the album a great one . i give this album 4 star because it ha a lot of good song .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i love this song . it is very relaxing . it kind of reminds me of those feel good song with a beat .

0	i really like this album .
1	the greatest of my life .

1	this is one of my favorite album . i like it alot . i like all the song . it is always good to hear a band with more than just one singer .
0	if you like her music , then you should buy this cd . her voice is amazing . it is not easy listening , but if you like her music , then you should buy this cd . her music is very beautiful . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . the music is amazing . you can tell that this album wa recorded by someone who know how to do it well .
0	this is the song with the most sexual lyric ever . i like it .
1	i love this song . however , what really make me love this song is the fact that it is the only song that i can sing along with from my car to work . i know this is a very simple song , but it just hit me in the heart . i hope it doe the same for you .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this is one of my favorite song . i have listened to it for the past 4 year . steve morse and pete knopfel are the king of the guitar world .
0	i wa wondering how i managed to get onto this . i wa not surprised , and i am happy with it . this is a big seller , and i expect it to keep in it top 10 seller for some time to come . i have been a fan and a fan of jan garbarek since the early 80 , when he wa with roxy music . i had hoped that when it came to me , he would come through , but i have to admit that he ha been with me all along . i hope that he continues . i have always said that his music is the most beautiful one which i have ever heard , and i am not ashamed to say that i love it and i hope that he continues to be in the band .
1	the chorus is a little difficult to follow at first , but once the song get rolling , it is great fun .
1	this is the most well produced song i have heard from this artist . it doe lack a few song but it is still very well produced . it is well played .
1	i have to say i am not a fan of the beatles music at all , but i do like this album very much and i am glad there are people that like it ! the beatles were great and the music of this album will stay with me for many year so it is a great purchase ! i have listened to this album for about five hour , and i have not heard a note that i did not like - very nice .
0	i love bruno mar album but i do not like this song when i listen to it .
1	i have not heard this song yet , but i like it a lot . it is a very good song .
0	i do not know if this is a real song , but it is a very pretty song . i like it a lot when it is played through the stereo speaker . it can be used to relax the mind and body . this is a good choice for those who want to sleep .
0	i really like this album . the only problem is that the vocal are so soft that at time it sound like the voice are coming from another room . it wasnt a problem at first but i just can not get over the fact that it is a double album . it is so short . it is so short . i would recommend this album to anyone who like jazz or anyone who is looking for a great jazz cd .
0	great singing voice , but the song are really not her best .
0	she can write song better than i can . she writes the lyric well .
0	i liked this cd . i pre ordered it . however i did not like this album nor the dave clark five . after listening to it , i will probably not buy anything from them ever again . i am so happy that i got the first two cd in a series in a box . i am not happy with this series .
1	i wa looking forward to this album . it is really good . i like sam sparros black and gold album . this is a great song . it is different from sam sparros live in concert album . i think the sound is great . i do not know why this ha not been released , and i would love to have it . i would rate it highly because it is a fun song . i have listened to it before , and it is great . i would rate it a 4/5 .
0	this is my first album that i have not been excited about . when i got it i wa not expecting that much , but i wa wrong ! it is got a lot good song . every song on here is good . the only song i would not recommend is i am a believer . it is not a bad song , but i still would not recommend it .
1	this album is a really beautiful album . i love it .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	dave clark five - live :
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is one of the best book i have ever read . i wa hooked from the very first page . i have been searching for a book like this for a long time . this is by far the best i have read ! i recommend it to anyone that love a great love story , and is a good story .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i love it ! it is really something else . i hope it is a popular album .
0	i have no idea what i should do with this . i like that she sings about her pain and about the people that love her , but i really like the music on this album and i really enjoy the new song . it seems like every song is a new song . it is just my opinion , but i hope she come back . i loved the video . i hope she and her boyfriend get back together because i love her .
1	his voice is the most important part of his music .

1	the album wa a great buy . it is pretty much a mix of hit and the new stuff . i am not a huge fan of either of the two , but i am not going to complain about the band either . i still wish they would add their own music to their set . it would make it more like a live show . i like the new stuff , but i am having a hard time listening to these song without thinking of the band that covered them .

0	this song is so boring . i wa bored out of my mind .
1	a true gem . this band is truly unique in the world of electronic music that i have experienced . their sound is so unique that you will find a lot of people that like them . i am a huge sucker for any new electronic music .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

0	i liked his song i thought they were great .
1	this is probably my favorite song so far . it is a very good song , and i think that it is just a good with or without the choir .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	i think she ha a great voice , but this is definitely not her best album .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i have no idea what this band is about except that they are good . i have been listening to them since they came out . i like their music .
1	i got this album on a whim . i liked it , but i did not like perry como .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this is an okay song . i enjoy the song , but the video is not the best .
1	this album is amazing . i love the whole album , including the music , but the music is quite boring to me . i do not understand why the music is so boring to me , because i know the song , the instrumentation , and the beat .
1	the music on this album is great . i wa a huge fan of the first couple of album . this album is amazing . i really enjoyed listening to this album .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i love the song , i hope she sings it in concert .
1	i am a huge fan of your music . when i first heard this song i thought it wa great . it make me feel all warm and fuzzy , especially when you sing i do not know why i feel the way i do . i hope it is successful .
0	i really liked it . it is a good mix of old and new .
1	this is one of the best song from the band ! my brother and i got this for christmas . we have been listening to it at night at bedtime .
0	i do not know where to start with this . this album reminds me of the smashing pumpkin . i like some of the song , but i do not really know why this album ha been on amazon for so long .
1	i love this . it is a great song for any occasion . it always make me think of my daughter , whenever i am driving , i will try to think of something positive i could say to make her feel better .
0	sam sparro ha some good music , but i do not think that it is good enough to be on idol . i have always been a fan of her music .
1	i have been a fan of these album ever since i discovered them in the 80 . i am the music director for a jazz radio station and the music i play is mainly jazz , but i also play a lot of classical music .
1	this is my second tape of the year , and it is great . i like the cd version better , but this tape is much better .
0	i like the song , but i do not think it is a good song . it is just bad . i do not know how people are putting this album on repeat . this is a very well produced album . i think it is a shame that i do not think the album is good . the album is good but it is not amazing .
1	i love to listen to hammond . this is a great album .
0	i am not a fan of her song . i do not even know why i bought this cd . it is just so bland , and boring . i have heard her cd . i like her music . i like the cover . i would give it a 5 out of 5 , but i do not know why i bought it . it is just so bland . it is all about her . this is just one of those cd that i would never buy again .
0	i liked this song . i am really surprised at how good this one wa . it ha a great tune .
1	this is a good album . there are a lot good song on this album
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i like to listen to tom scott album
1	i wa really excited to hear this song but after listening to it , i wa disappointed .
1	this is a great album ! i am not a huge pop music guy but this is worth listening to . i also prefer the acoustic version of this album over the electric version . this album is great for listening to when you are driving or walking to work ( i have been listening to this a i am driving to work ) . this is my second favorite song on the cd .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i have been listening to it from elementary school through high school . i love the message it ha . i hope the song will be added to my collection !
0	i like to listen to the music i buy . this is a good country music album !
0	this song never made it on the radio until a few year ago . not even then for a year or two . i think the people with the volume turned up full blast and it just faded away . it is so catchy & the lyric say it all about relationship . it is a great song to listen to while making your bed or doing dish .
0	i wa a big fan of reo speedwagon , and i am excited to have discovered this new album . it is a great mix of style , and i really like the song . i would recommend this album to anyone who like their country music . like i said , it is good for those who like the country music , but it doe not appeal to me . i wish they had more country song .
0	i think i will pas on this one . it ha a nice little melody , but it doe not really grab me like other song on this album . even during the chorus .
1	i love the vocal of this song & feel it is a very nice song .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this album is the best cd i have ever purchased . it is worth buying . i give it 10 star .
0	this song will always remind me of when i wa a kid and i would sing it to my mom .
0	i am a country music fan and love this band . i think they are pretty good .
1	this is the most beautiful love song i have ever heard . i especially like the part where the piano play the melody .
0	he is a unique talent in the music world .
1	i love dave clark five , and their great song .
1	i got this cd for my son who is 4 and love it . he ha now given it to his friend . i hope they enjoy it too ; )
0	this song is a good song , but it is not for everyone . the lyric are good but it is a very very heavy song .
0	the music of this album always make me feel a sense of pride , joy and wonder of the world . there is always a great message , and a deep love for a great person who ha inspired you .
0	this song sound like crap .
1	i think this is an excellent app for all music lover . i downloaded and bought the song christmas ( bought a house for christmas ) by john lennon and it is so cool . i have been able to use this app to listen along while i am driving and i think it is a great app ! i have also downloaded the song christmas ( i am gon na be here on christmas day ) by james taylor . it is a great song to listen to while waiting in line at the grocery store .
1	this is a great album for those who like classical music . while it is not the big band album i wa hoping for , it is still enjoyable and worth picking up .
0	it is a great song , but i do not like the song . it is a great song , but i do not like the song .
0	so what do you think ? the album is nice , the song are good , but the album is really not worth the $ 200 .
1	i love this song . it is one of my favorite . i am a big fan of the beatles music .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i loved the album when i first heard it on the radio . but i never had it on my ipod . i have been searching for it for several day now , but can not find it anywhere . it is been a long time since i have heard this album . please get it to me !

0	i found this album very boring . it had good song and the lyric were cool . the only song i really did not like wa love you baby . the other three song were good , but i thought the lyric were really bad .
0	i have listened to this cd more than i should . to me , this is a boring cd that doe not move me either musically or lyrically . my only comment is that i like her voice and her lyric . the music is just ok. i enjoy her song and i think she ha a very unique and beautiful voice . i enjoy her music and i think she ha a very unique and beautiful voice . but , i can not stand her lyric . it is just a if they were made to rhyme . i have listened to music other artist have made that are also bad . but , not this one . i like this artist . i think she is great . i would like to meet her . i would like to see her live . but , i do not think she would like me .
0	to all those out there that think this is supposed to be some kind of a tribute , i do not know why you would listen to anything this guy ha ever written . i do not even know how to respond to you . sorry if i sound like a troll .
0	one small point , i believe this song is supposed to be a version of the star spangled banner . i like the song that wa on the cd . however , the song on the cd is a little bit of a disappointment . the song did not have any of the lyric you would expect from the song . it really seemed to be a cover , and it certainly wasnt a song that i wa expecting . this song just did not suit me .
1	i am listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of day . it is a great song . it is a beautiful song . it is a song that i will listen to over and over again .

0	this is a really good album , but i think there is a lot of repetition .
0	this is great ! i know it is not the best version of this song , but it is really good . i like the dave clark five version better at this point , but this is really good . it is really good .
1	i loved this cd . it is a great dance party album . i love the name dancing in the dark . i thought it wa a great name , but the song dancing in the dark is just awesome . i know that the cd is called dancing in the dark , but it is about a little kid who is dancing in the dark . so you have to be a little kid to listen to this cd . i recommend this cd to everyone because of the song dancing in the dark .

0	i am disappointed with the quality of the music on the site . i would have liked to have heard more song from the band , and the music video on the site is very amateurish . i would have liked to have seen the band live performance , or at least a clip or two . the song on the site are very repetitive and the guitar playing is very annoying and inconsistent . the site is a waste of time .
1	this is relaxing , but i wish there were more word to what i am hearing . it is relaxing .
1	not too bad . there is a bit of noise in the recording , but the sound is pretty good . the sound quality of this album is better than most of the cd i have had . it is a good mix of song that i would like to listen to .

1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i like her song , but the lyric are very boring . i am glad i can still hear the song though .

0	i would like to add that i have only been a fan of the dave clark five for about 2 year now . i got my first cd from them and when i got home and wanted to play it , it would not play . i called the customer service number and they said they would call me back . i told them i am a paying customer and i wa going to start listening to the cd again . i waited about 2 day and called the customer service number again . they said they would call me back . i waited another 2 day and called the customer service number again . they said they were going to call me back . i waited about 2 more day and called the customer service number again . they said they were going on a vacation and would call me later in the week . i waited a total of 3 day and finally got a call from the customer service number . they told me that they would not be giving me new music from the dave clark five until we resolved the problem with the cd . they told me that i had to send them the cd and they would let me know when the cd had been resolved . i have tried calling them and talking on the phone , but they never answer . i have been a paying customer for over 2 year and i just stopped .

0	i wa born in london , england , in 1951. i have been a huge fan of beethoven music since i wa a child . i had been listening to the ode to joy in beethoven 9th for a long time , and i thought these two recording would be a good way to introduce myself to this music .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	this song is amazing ! it really is one of the best song ever .
1	i really like this cd . great music and great lyric .

0	i like this song .
0	i wa looking for a new cd player , and i stumbled across the composer . my copy wa $ 5.00 . that is a great price . i had to buy it , because i had a $ 20.00 cd player that would play no cd . i had to buy an adapter to play the composer , so it can play the cd . i do not know why the composer can not play the cd . i will let you know . thank you .

0	i would give this cd a 5 star if only the song were better .
1	i did not order this cd from amazon . i bought it because i wa in the neighborhood and i wa wanting to hear all of the new release . i love the music of this band , but it is not the type of music that i would buy , especially not in one sitting .

1	love this album
0	i like the song . it is a good song . i like the harmony .
0	i am a big fan of this singer , but this album , a far a i can tell , is about the singer herself . i love that she sings with passion and emotion but she doe not seem to be that great of a singer . the lyric seem a little dated , but there are a few good one on here . the overall feel of the album is the same , a little more country with a touch of rock and roll . i am not sure what else to say . it is a very good album , a good start , but not so great . i would say that it is better than the singer previous album . the first album wa way too poppy and the second album wa way too rock and roll . this album is better , but i am not the most impressed .
1	i love everything about this song . i think it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it speaks to the soul .
1	the song go on for a little while , but i feel like it wa just over . this is a great song . this is a great song . it ha a great beat , and great lyric . the lyric are beautiful . i think it is a great song . i would listen to it again . i like it . i would listen to it again .
0	great album ! i wa a little bit disappointed to find that the album had the same track a the r & b music , vol . 1 album . i wa kind of excited to hear that this album wa released with the same track , but i am still happy that i bought this cd . i really do like the song on this album . the album is good and i would recommend it to anyone .
1	i wa in a funk for a few year and i just could not get into jazz . i finally found tom scott on the internet and tried his cd . i could not stop listening to it . i love the way he creates his music , i love his voice and the way he writes his song . he is really talented . i am a fan of his .
1	this is a good start to get the ballad going . i found it very relaxing and soothing . it ha a nice bluesy feel and there are many different style of music on here . if you like blue this would be a nice starting point .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this cd wa a waste of money .

0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this song is really good , and it doe what it need to do . it is just not very good .
0	this is a good song , but i think it is a little too long . i think that the song should be shorter , no longer than two minute .
1	i like this cd . it ha a nice mix of old and new song . it is a bit of a mixed bag . it ha old-school and contemporary song mixed together . some of the song are good , but they do not really stand out from the others . some of the song have a feel that make them stand out . it is not a bad cd , but it doe not have that wow factor . it is just kind of average . the only standout song is praise be the lord , which is a really good song . other song do not really have that wow factor . i love song like praise be the lord , praise , and praise is what i do . i really like the song that are upbeat song , but they do not stand out a much . the song that are slow and quiet song do not really have that wow factor . i think this cd is good , but i think i will be buying it again .
1	this is good and fun . i really like this album . it is fun and entertaining . i give it an 8 because the song are good and the album is good .
0	i like mileys video but i would have liked for it to be a bit darker and more dramatic . i think it would have been better if there wa more emotion to the video .

1	this is my all time favorite song .
1	this is one of my favorite song of all time .

0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .

1	this ha one of the best tom wait song i have heard . i think it is one of the best tom wait song . it is very simple , but very good . the only thing i don
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	the best song on this album .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i wa at a friend home the other day and heard a friend playing this . it is just too cool . i got it for my mom . it is a great cd to keep your lover guessing about which track you are listening to . it is definitely a must-have .
0	i had to make a return trip to the amazon store , so i bought this cd in the hope that it would turn out to be a very good cd . it turn out to be just that ! it is a very good cd , but i have to say , it is not easy to find classical music of the quality that this is . the only problem with listening to it is that it take me back to a different time , but i like it and i am glad that i bought this cd . it is a great cd .
0	i like the song . the beat on this is great . the lyric are pretty good too . i think it is a good song . it is better than gnaw . i think it is a good song . there are too many good song on the site but they just do not make the list . the song is good but not great . i wish they would play this song more often . it is good but not great . i think this is a good song . i think it is a good song , but not great . i think it is a good song , but not great .

1	i have been listening to this cd for a few day now and i must say i am surprised by the quality and quantity of the song . at first i thought it wa a one time thing , but now i am beginning to wonder if there will be another cd just like it . i have a feeling it is going to be a real hit . for the first time in my life i am listening to a cd that is so good you can not stop .

1	the beatles were the most influential band in the world . they influenced thousand of musician , including myself , and they influenced me . they also influenced the way i think . this is the best collection of song i have ever heard .
0	this is the fifth time i have heard this song and it is definitely one of the worst . the song is so bad that it is one of the few which i have never gotten used to . i will not listen to it again unless there is a copy of it available for purchase . the fact that the song wa recorded in a church auditorium probably explains why the church choir sounded so bad . the lyric are extremely clichéd and the vocal are so bad that they are unrecognizable . the sound quality is also poor .

0	i have several cd of reo speedwagon and one of the cd is i am so lonesome sung by the band . it ha very little sound , almost no bass or drum . it is a little depressing . i have another cd of the same band i will be right there that ha better sound . i like the sound better . it is a little more positive . i have heard a lot of cd and i have never heard this one before . i wish the author would write a review on his cd .

0	i thought her song wa very good .
0	this is a new tune , like the one on the previous track , which i am not going to listen to . i do not like the fact that there is no melody . this one just a melody without any melody . there is no chord progression , nor doe it have any , period . the chord progression are all wrong and it is a mess .
0	i wa disappointed with this song . it had no redeeming quality and all of the lyric were just so stupid .
0	i think that this album is a good album . the song are very good , the guitar is nice , the vocal are good , the production is good , and the album overall is worth the money .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	the opening is a perfect example of the type of song that would make a great country-pop song . the lyric are also superb . it is a shame this old man is not mentioned on the cover . the harmony are excellent .
1	i think this song is a little overproduced . i liked the song when i first heard it , but after a few time listening to it , i really do not like it anymore . i think it sound much better the first time .
1	this song and video are amazing .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i have listened to this song since i wa a little boy . it ha the same effect on me that a good cry doe .
1	i bought this album in order to find out what to do with my aging cassette player . i heard this album on the radio and knew i had to have it . the song the best thing that never wa , is my favorite song on the entire album . i think the album is a good mix of rock , punk , and new wave . there is a good mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in . i enjoy the song hound dog a lot and the album is a great mix of rock , punk , and new wave . i think this album is a good mix of rock , punk , and new wave .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is an excellent collection .
1	i bought this album for my daughter , and she wa over the moon . she loved it . i have a 7 yr old daughter . she love music , and this cd is a must have . she want to play it constantly .
0	this is a very well made mp3 but since it is taken out , i have lost all hope for mp3s .
0	i like this cd . i like the album .
1	this album wa not intended to be a best of list . i have listened to this album for year and have not been disappointed . i would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates john mayer or james taylor , or simply any good song by an artist who i enjoy .
1	tom scott . the best of the best .
1	this is the best trance album of the year so far . i think that this album is quite good , the song are really good and the production is really excellent .
1	just bought the cd .
1	this is an excellent collection . this is a great album to get you started on learning to play jazz guitar .
0	i think this song is very cool . i like the part where they start singing the chorus .
0	i have no idea who this song sound like . it reminds me of a cross between piece of your heart by the eagle and he is so fine by amy winehouse , and it make me think of a song by the new radical .
1	this song doe not have any vocal harmony but it ha a lovely piano backing .
0	this is very good ! i like the album
0	aw , it is so boring .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i love this song . i have had it for year and year . i do not know how it slipped my memory , but it wa a favorite of mine when i first heard it .
0	the song is so awful
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i really like this song . it is good . it is a good song .
1	i am a big fan of r.kellys music and have been for year . this cd ( the best of r.kelly ) is by far one of the best of his cd . there are song that i like and song that i do not like , but it is not a bad cd . i personally like the second disc . the song that i do not like are the one that are usually sung by woman . it seems that a lot of the music on his album is sung by woman , and i do not like that . i do not think that woman should sing on his album . on the second disc , he play some of his classic r & b song . some of his hit , like love mean everything to me and you wa made for me are very well done .
1	i have not been a fan of this artist . this album had a very different feel from his past album . the song are well written , and the production is very good . this album is a good album .
1	it is a great song . i love barbra streisand singing .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i thought this wa a really good cd . the first song is get up and go , but i am not quite sure what the song is about . i am also a little bit confused about i can not stop . i am not a fan of i can not stop . it is a really slow song . the song is really good and everyone is singing along to it . this is a really good cd . i can not wait to hear the music video . and the cd is really good . it is a really good cd with a really good song . i really recommend this cd to everyone .
0	i am not a country fan , but i do like listening to country music . i thought this wa a cool song and will listen to it again .
1	this song is awesome , but the song could be stronger . it is very good .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i have heard all the song from this artist , and i have to say that i really love this song , i love the beat , i love the style of the song , i love the lyric , i love the feel of the song , i love the music , i love the whole song , i love the harmony , i love the voice on the song , i love the guitar , and i love the piano part , and i love how the whole song go . i love how the vocal are always on point , and i love how the whole song is not just a bunch of chorus and verse and bridge , but the song go on and on and on . it is amazing , i love the song , and i love the artist brandy , but i think this song is just a bunch of bad luck , because it doe not sound like a brandy song at all , it sound like a song where alfie boe is singing it , and i am sure that is not a good thing . please do not waste my time with this song . this song wa good when it first came out , and then it became bad and now it is become worse . please stop making this song , it is bad enough that you are making a bad product out of it , but add in your bad luck , it make it even worse . i have tried to listen to the song , it doe not sound like it at all , and i am sure it is not a brandy song . please stop making this song and i will gladly give you my money back .
0	i love all the song on this album . i love the message behind all of them .
1	i love this album . i listen to it every day . i love this album .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .

0	very good , but not for the faint of heart .
1	if you like hard rock , and if you like the beatles , then this is the album for you . great lyric . great sound . great feel . great music . i would highly recommend this album .
1	i am a big fan of this song . it is super catchy , and there is not alot of word on the song , but it is good .
0	i think it is a good song , but it is not a great song . i mean , i think david lee roth wa a very talented singer and a very good performer . but his vocal are very much of the pop variety and they do not really fit his style . and , to be fair , he is not exactly a bad singer either . but his voice simply make his music sound bad . i have listened to several of his album and he still sound like he is singing for a high school choir . so his voice just doe not fit the song he sang on . but it is a pretty good song , so i still give this a 3 star rating .
0	i like this song , but the vocal are poor . the vocal have been improved , but the song doe not stand out any longer .
1	this is my favorite of the two . this is the one i love best . i love how she sings live .
1	this is what i call a tom wait cd . i did not know what to expect with this cd . i like tom wait because he is very creative and he is very creative with his record . this is a tom wait cd and i am happy with it . i think it is a fun and good-sounding album . it ha a lot of energy and it is an enjoyable listen . it is not an exciting listen but it is well written . it is easy to enjoy and it is a decent listen . i will continue to purchase tom wait cd because i like tom wait . i
0	i have not been able to get through this song . i bought it because i heard it on the radio . i will have to listen to it a few time and decide if i like it or not .
0	the song not bad , but i do not like the lyric . the honey , i am home line , for example , is a bit annoying . also , i thought for a moment that she wa doing a high hat instead of a low hat . but this wa a great song .
1	this is the best country song i have ever heard .
0	i have to say , i had forgotten about this album . it is a bit different than the other i have tried . i wish i had read the review on it before i ordered it , i would have skipped it and gotten one of his earlier recording .
1	this is a great song ! i bought the cd , to listen to it with my dad and my nieghbour . we listened to it in the car and my
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	after a few listens to this cd , i can not believe i did not know this woman wa a great musician before now . she ha an incredible voice , and she doe an awesome job on the guitar . i have been a huge fan of her song since her first album , the best of jewel . this cd is definitely the best that she is ever done , and i am really glad that i got this cd instead of her previous cd . her playing is incredible , and i would definitely recommend this cd to anyone , especially people who are into music . this cd is excellent , and i can not wait to give it to my friend . it is an excellent cd , and i am really glad i got it . i thought it wa the best jewel album that she ha done , and i will definitely be buying more jewel album from now on .

1	this is one of my all time favorite album .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

1	i think that christmas is the best season of the year and what better way to celebrate than with good music and good food . a lot of people are afraid of eating the same old crap and will rather eat something new , something special . this album is one of the best food cd i have heard in a long time . i do not know how you can possibly find anything bad on this album .

1	this is a great album . i enjoy the arrangement and the music . the lyric are good , but the vocal are weak . when the vocal fail , the music succeeds . it is a perfect blend of traditional country and a little bit of rock and roll . i have yet to meet anyone who doe not like this cd . i have no complaint . i think it is a great cd and a great addition to your collection . i think that this cd is a wonderful album to have and i think that you will find it to be one of your favorite . i found this album to be a very good album . i liked it a great deal . i have to admit that i had a hard time deciding which cd to buy first . i kept looking at different cd and wa about to return them all , when i saw this cd in a store , which wa on sale . so , i bought it . i did not even think about it , but i decided to buy it because it wa on sale . once i had bought it , i immediately put it on and enjoyed it . i had not heard it on vinyl , so i listened to it just like a cd . i really enjoyed listening to this cd . it ha a great blend of both traditional country and rock and roll . the song are good , the arrangement are good , but the music is not outstanding . i think that this cd is a great album to have and a great addition to your collection . i think that this cd fit well with your collection and i think that you will enjoy it a great deal . i found this album to be a very good album . it is a great album to have . this cd is a wonderful album to have and a wonderful addition to your collection . this album is a great album . i wa able to enjoy listening to the music on this cd , and i really enjoyed listening to it . the song are great , the arrangement are great , the musicianship is great , but the melody are not outstanding . my only complaint is that the lyric are not outstanding . i think that this cd is a wonderful album to have and a wonderful addition to your collection , and i think that you will enjoy it a great deal . i like this cd . i found this album to be a great album to have and a wonderful addition to your collection . i feel that this cd fit well with your collection and i think that you will find it to be a great addition to your collection . i feel that this cd fit well with other cd that you own and i think that you will find that it fit well with other cd that you own . i liked this cd . i liked this cd . this is a great album to have and a wonderful addition to your collection . this album fit well with other cd that you own and i think that you you will find that it fit well with other cd that you own , i liked this cd . i liked this cd . i liked this cd . i found this album to be a great album to own . this album fit well with others cd that you own and i think that you will find that it is a great album to own . i liked this cd . i like this album to own . this album fit well with others cd that i own . i liked this album . i liked this cd . this is a
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	this song is a good song to dance to . i like this song . i like this song . this is a good song to dance to . this is a good song to dance to . it is a good song to dance to . i like this song . this is a good song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like practice . it is a good song to dance to . i like practice . it is a good song to dance . i like practice .
0	so this song is not that bad . i do not like it but it is not bad . it ha a good beat and she ha a nice voice .
0	i love my ipod touch . i can still sing along to the oldie station and i am hooked on music .
0	this is an excellent song . the only downside is that the chorus is a little repetitive .
1	this album is an album that is so well done . the music is very , very well produced , and the song are very well written and sung . i will say that this album ha a very different feel than other worship album that i have listened to . it is very out there and very edgy a i would put it . the song i am most impressed with is praise is what i do a very upbeat and fun song that is sure to keep you dancing . this album is a good album .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i don think i would have listened to this cd if it wasnt for this one . i found it very relaxing and soothing . it ha a good blend of blue , country , jazz and pop style . the instrumentals are nice and the vocal blend with the instrumental very well . i like the way it ha a nice bluesy feeling . if you like a bluesy feel this would be a good start to get the ballad going .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i can say that this album is the best of his album .
1	i love this song , but i can not understand how it got on there for me . it is beautiful . it wa very nice to hear it again .
1	this live album is great . the band sounded great and sounded like they were having fun . the song are all good , but my favorite ha to be lonely eye .
1	i think the band did a great job with this . they covered i need a man and i think it is also a great cover . the band is great and the sound of the band is good . i really like the band .
1	i heard this through a friend recommendation . i really like this song and the name of it is the risotto song . i think i will be back to take another listen .
1	this is one of my favorite album ever .
0	this album is a great album but i do not think it is going to be on the top of my list .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this is the best cover i have ever heard . i would like to hear the song on the radio .
1	the cd is great and i am glad i bought it .
1	this album is good , but it is not a favorite .
1	this song really doe what it is supposed to do . it is a good song that i can sing to . i like this song . it is good .
1	i love this song .
0	an oldie but goodie - a real old-school blues-rockers ! it is the best blues-rock in year . if you like it , you will like it .
1	i found this song for free on the internet . it wa really good . i would buy the album for sure .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i bought a long gone song a a gift for my sister . very nice !
1	i have a very favorite album by tom wait , all the album i have listen to all the time . i love his work and i have been listening to his album for many year .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this is the only trance album i bought because i wa really excited about the state of trance album cover . i did not know what to expect from it so i just bought it and i wa right . this album wa extremely good . i love that the lyric are written in a different style than other trance album . the music alone is amazing . there wa nothing that i did not like about this album .
0	this is the original version and not the later version with i can not get no satisfaction added in . this song wa made famous in a movie about boxing . the song is about how a boxer think when he loses a fight . this is the version i heard from the movie . the original version is much better . this is the version i heard at the concert in nashville . it is also the version that wa included on the soundtrack of the movie . this version wa also included on her first cd in 1999 .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i wa disappointed with this album . i like his earlier work and this is not a good . there are no new song and just repeated song . when this wa first released , i thought it wa the best work he ha done so far . the album is not one of the best i have ever heard , but it is not bad . it is nice to have good song like the one above , a well a the next song , we are always together .
0	i have been a fan of the beatles for a long a i can remember . the white album and i want to hold your hand were both a big plus for me . i recently purchased the come together cd which is one of the great album . this album is great and it wa produced by an artist/producer that i have come to respect and admire . i feel that this album , along with the beatles white album , are the two best rock and roll album in my collection .
0	i think this is one of the worst song ever made a there is nothing special about it . i think it is overrated . this is the kind of music i wa brought up on .
1	i do not know anything about these guy but i like the song . the song is a little different from the other song on the album . it is just a little bit more mellow . i like the name of the album .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i think this is a great album . i have only bought it once . it is very good . i do not listen to much music but i think i will listen to this alot more .
1	my favorite song on the album is all alone with something to say . i love this song . i love this song .
1	i have the cd and i love it . this is one of the best jazz album i have ever heard . it is a very diverse album . i love the song and the arrangement . a good jazz album is hard to find . this is a very good jazz album . i really enjoy it . it is a great purchase . i recommend this album to anyone who love jazz .
1	this is one of my favourite track . the vocal are great . the guitar work is great . it is great to listen to .
0	i agree with the sentiment . this is not the best or most beautiful of karajan composition from this era , but it is a fine one to hear . i also found karajans use of the traditional trumpet to be excellent here . it is one of the few recording of this sort in which the trumpet is not drowned out by the other instrument . the flute and violin have a certain sense of intimacy that is part of karajans genius a a composer . when the orchestra play the piano , they seem to be playing on the same level a the violin and cello . that is karajan .
0	the only reason i have listened to this album a long a i have is because of the b-side - i believe it is titled a few of the smaller hit - i am not sure how many i have at my house yet .
1	i thought this song wa great , but the way it is sung wa a little too dry for me . i like it better when it is sung
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	it is not the version i listened when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing .
1	i do not think i have ever heard this song , but i agree with the other reviewer . it is a very good song !
1	i like this tape . i think it is a great way to start the day .
1	this collection wa released by the record label omni , who do not understand why i would spend money on this box set . they did not even know what to do with the recording in the box set . i have used this collection of recording for year and have never had any complaint . it ha been a blessing to me . i have learned from it and i have been able to bring this collection of recording into the studio and play them with my own vocal . i have used this collection of recording for year and have never had a single complaint . it ha been a blessing to me . i have learned from it and been able to bring this collection of recording into the studio and play them on my own vocal .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this album is a must own trance album ! if you like trance this is the one for you ! if you are looking to buy a trance album you got it !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i found the music on this cd to be very good . it feature many great song . i give it a b. it is a very good cd . i give it an a .
0	love the choir music and the whole idea of a hymn for a song . i am always a fan of hymn that end with a chorus .
1	i thought i had heard it all , but i wa very pleasantly surprised by this album . i love the dave clark five . their music is sweet and always keep me listening .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i wa looking for a hard-core , thrash metal band . after listening to this album , i found the album to have a lot of good thing , however , the music is very hard to listen to . i enjoy hard-core , thrash metal , but this ha a lot of good thing in it , but at the same time , it is very hard to listen to . this is not a good cd .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i really liked this one , but i wa wondering why there wa no audio of it . it is a really nice piece of music . it is very upbeat and fun .
1	i bought this album for the first time on a whim . i wa disappointed when i heard all the song were just rehashed song from the 70 . i am not a fan of that style of music . i am glad i bought the album though , because i have never had a cd by this band that i wa happy with .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	she had a lot of good song and she got some decent number . not the best , but the song are good . the song are not the best though , the lyric are terrible .
0	this wa a live recording from a local band called the shred . all i can say is that this band sounded like they played in their hometown . the song shred wa very short and played on a drum machine and guitar . i did not think anything of it at first , until i heard the lyric . they were really good . not only wa the sound quality good , but the lyric were very good . the song wa about how a person can be a great friend and a great enemy . they were pretty good . the lyric i hear most are about how much a person care for people . maybe not the best lyric , but they were very good .
1	this is a very good album . i like it a lot .
0	i wa expecting more from this cd at first . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once listened to it . however , i wa expecting more than what i got . i am a fan of her music . i believe in what she is doing , but i have to say this album is a bit disappointing to me .
1	this is a very good album . the only problem i have with it is that it is one of the most repeated album that i have ever heard by jon lord .
1	i loved this album . i love this album . i have been a fan since day one .
1	i have purchased many cd , and have loved finding the best deal on mp3s . amazon is a great site to shop online . i like it , and i will continue to shop there .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i like the song and i think it is one of the best song .
1	i love this song ! it is just so fun to sing .
0	i love this song . it is a great song . i love the lyric . it is just a really good song . i can never get enough of this song .
0	i really like this album , the only reason i did not give it five star is because i like all his other album more and i do not like this one so much . i am definitely going to buy the album for my sister birthday . i am going to listen to it with her . i am just not really into this music .
0	this album is a great album . i think song on this album are better then the last album .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this album is a great album for worship and praise ! the song are very good and the vocalist are very well spoken . the song are all well known , and the music is very well sung . i love it .
1	this album wa amazing . i love maria houghton voice . she is very talented . i love the song . i wish that perry como would record more christmas music .
1	i first discovered this band when i got in my car and heard it on the radio . i think it is really good .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this album is good but it is a little boring . the sound quality is great but i do not like the cd . the cd is about a woman who go to a dance . the music is good . i do not like the lyric and the story . the cd is about a woman who go to a dance .
1	i am a big fan of the more r.kelly , i have been listening to their music since the 70 and i do not get tired of it . i have been listening to every track , they have really stepped up their game , they are making their music relevant again and i can not wait for their next project . i love the sound of this cd and their new album the gift and the giver . i listened to the cd at work and the first song caught my attention . it is like listening to a whole new album every time i hear it , i can not wait for their second cd .
0	this cd is a lot different from the first cd . i really enjoyed the first cd , and this one is a lot better .
0	the song is pretty much the same a the song before . i do not mind it , but it seems to me that this is the same song sung over and over again , and not a great song .
0	this a great song . the music is really great and the lyric are really good . i would recommend this to anyone who like old school hiphop .
1	i love the song , the video is amazing , i like this song .
1	this song is so godly , i love it !
1	this song ha a great melody , great lyric , great vocal and great instrumentation . it is a great way to end an album .
0	i love the barbra streisand collection . i listen to it a lot while i wait for my dinner . the album is not bad at all , but it is not my favorite . she did a lot more than just that cd . i just think she is a great singer , but she is not barbra streisand . she probably doe not sing the way i would like to hear her .
0	i really like the first three track . i like the way it is , but the other track are a bit lacking for me : you do not know me and in my dream . the album sound very generic to me .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	this is another great prince song . the song is very similar to a song by jvj . i like both version . i love this song . this is one of the best prince song . the song is very similar to a song by jvj , but it is the original version . i love the song . i have the original soundtrack of the movie purple rain . i have the dirty mind album , and the a prince and the new power generation album . do you know who the artist is ? he ha a very interesting name . the music in the film wa done by the same people who did the music for the album dirty mind . this is a great prince song . it is a great song to listen to with the sound turned up .
1	bonnies music is amazing . love the song - can not wait to listen to the album .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	for those who think r & b is dead , they are mistaken . i am not sure why the review are so negative . most of the song that i have listened to are the artist that came before him . some that i have listened to are not r & b . these are all excellent artist and are still doing well . this is a great artist who is not only doing well , but ha made some great song .
0	this ha been on my mind . i have been wanting to check this album out but wa too lazy to go to the store and get it . the album is amazing , but i can not stand the annoying voice of the singer . he sound like that idiot on the honey song from the american pie . i have to go back and listen to it again with out the annoying voice . this band is amazing , i am going to buy this album .
0	i love it when a song make me feel like a child . this song made me feel like i wa back in elementary school again , just wanting to be a kid and be a kid always .
1	this song reminds me of the song i will be home from the movie fury .
1	i love old-timey country music . this is one of my favorite !
1	this is an excellent and well-recorded collection containing the complete recording of the music of george gershwin . i love this collection , and would recommend it to all those who have their own music collection .
0	i have seen this album around when it wa first released and i am pretty sure i wa the only fan . i liked this album , but i found it a little too repetitive . i feel like the song have been put on repeat so many time that it is hard to find a new song that will move you . i liked the first half of the song a song you will never forget but the song this time wa really repetitive . i give this album a 2.5 .
1	i really do not like this album . i think that i will never buy it . i like the video , but i just do not like the album . i do not like it at all . i do not think that it
0	this is a very good example of a simple song . there are a couple of problem i have noticed though . i have noticed that the song doe not have a chord progression . the song is also a little repetitive . i will be adding to the song a i go . i like the simplicity of it . i think that i will have to write down a few more song to make it a good a it is . it is a very simple song that ha a good melody and lyric . i hope to have a few more song to add to the site very soon .
0	i like the album a lot . it is a good mix of song and they make great use of the studio and there is a lot of variety in the song .
0	the song is so good i am going to buy the cd .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	this song is so beautiful . i love the way the chorus repeat itself and the way the drum and guitar play together . i love this song .
0	at first , this song had me thinking it would be a great song , but then i realized it wa just a lot of fast and too fast .
0	wow , this cd is great . i have heard that after the who is live at the roxy album , there are some issue with the sound quality . i bought this cd on the recommendation of an amazon associate , and i am glad i did . i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not delighted . the sound quality is good and the cd ha a few good song , but the lyric are not great .

0	i wa driving home from work last night when this song came on . i am not a fan of i am a believer , but i love you have got a friend in me and i need love . this last one really hit me .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i like this song , and i do not like the version that is currently playing everywhere else , but i have not heard the original . i like this version better than the version with the way you look tonight that is playing everywhere else . i like the sound of this song better than the song .
0	a very good album . i like it a lot . i like it a lot .
0	one of the better mike varney tribute album that is le like his usual type of stuff and more like an album of his music . i do not think that i have ever heard him play guitar like this before . i like the fact that he ha sung a song where he sings i could not love you and you could not leave . it is a soulful song . i like it and it is my favorite . i would give it a rating of a- . mike varney wa a talented musician and a great friend to many .
1	this is a great song . the chorus is great . the singing is really well done . it is a good song .
0	i am quite pleased with this song , although it is a little long . the piece begin with soft , quiet violin . then , in the middle , the violin are interrupted by a solo violin . this violin make a few more attempt at playing the theme . there is then an instrumental break during which the entire orchestra play a variation of the theme . this is repeated in the third and fourth movement . this is then followed by the final solo violin . the solo violin make several solo effort . in the last solo , the violinist play a solo violin passage in the middle of the piece . this is then interrupted by a solo violin that start to play a solo violin part . and then , the final solo violin . the whole thing is very fast paced and very loud . this is a great rendition of this piece . i have been listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of day . i am quite impressed with the recording quality of this song . i would say it is a good buy .
0	i listened to this album a couple of time and i think it is a good cd . if you like jewel voice , please listen to the cd . my favorite song is my heart is not made of stone . at first i thought it wa a duet , but then realized it is jewel singing to her guitar . i am glad that she recorded it .
0	i love the music on this station .
0	it is a great song , i have seen it used in a lot of show , but never in a live show .
1	great album . the piano playing is great .
1	i have only gotten a few cd over the year but this is one of them . i can listen to this cd all day long and not tire out . i would not be surprised if this made me want to look for another cd . great music .
1	the only thing i did not like about this album wa the song all my loving and i will never love again . i have not listened to the album recently , but i think i have heard other reviewer talking about these two song and i thought they were very nice . i wa hoping they would be better , but they just can not be . in fact , i think they are the worst track on this album . the second song , i am gon na love somebody ( with love ) , is quite a good song , but it just doe not grab me . again , i have not listened to the album in a long time , but i have enjoyed other reviewer making remark about the song , and i am hoping they are wrong .
0	there is a lot of material on this cd . i would give it 1 star if it wa not for the fact that my computer is so slow that i can not listen to it at all . i would give it 1 star if it were not for the fact that i will have to get another cd .
0	
1	this is great !
0	i like the cover art and the song is pretty good , but the song is not really anything special . it is just a well-done ballad . i think it would be better if the song wa longer .
1	i love this song . i love the song . i have listened to it when i am alone .
1	i purchased this cd because i like i am a believer by miley cyrus and i like her music . i do not know how to rate this album . it is not an album . i am a fan of miley cyrus and i will continue to be a fan .
0	very interesting for anyone who like to play the guitar in the key of g .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this collection of recording wa provided by the record label omni . it wa recorded over a period of several year and wa made into a cd-r version about a year ago . when i received the cd-r i immediately took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top and then took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top . my intent wa to record the song on the cd-r with my own vocal and then put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve . i did that and then i put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve .
1	thanks for all the information . i had no idea who they were .
0	this is an average song . i like it , but i think it would be better played by a male singer . the music is very basic , but at the same time it is really catchy . the only thing i do not like about it is the lyric .

0	i have been a fan of jewel since her first cd dreaming . i have been disappointed by her music since then . this is a very disappointing album . it is like the cd that got you in trouble , and you had to listen to it for the rest of your life . i do not know how she can put out a cd like this . i hope i never meet her . she is a very rude and obnoxious person .
0	it is a very nice album . i prefer that she try to find her own voice , instead of always trying to be the same thing . this will be her last album .

0	i have to admit , i did not know who this singer wa . i thought he wa bob dylan . but a soon a he took the microphone , i knew he wa not bob dylan . this album is a lot better than i expected . it is more of a rock album than a country one . they do have a nice singer here but i still would not call this a rock album in the traditional sense . it is more of a straight up rock album . i like it a lot .

0	this is my first time buying something from amazon . i have been a fan for many year and have been purchasing all kind of item from them . i wa very happy to find this compilation of ansermets recording . i would highly recommend it to anyone who love ansermet or classical music in general . the playing is fantastic and the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined the experience for me , but that can be expected with a compilation of the recording .
1	it is called the rocky horror picture show so i am sure it is going to sound pretty good . i have not listened to it yet , but i heard it on the radio and it sounded like a good song .
1	i love this cd . it is great .
0	i remember listening to this song on cd . it wa one of the track on a promotional cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . i think it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching-up on some old television show and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable actor , gob , in arrested development . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	the recording in this cd collection are so well done . everything ha been recorded with such care that you can hear the string , woodwind , brass , and percussion . it is a real pleasure to listen to these recording . i have listened to many performance of the overture and never have i heard it recorded in such a manner that is so clear and in it glory .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i like this album . it is an awesome worship album . it is not a worship album to be messed with . it is a worship album to be listened to and enjoyed . i like the style of music . it is the perfect worship album for my family . there is nothing bad with this album . it is a great worship album to be listened to and enjoyed .
1	i am a big fan of jazz and this album is great . it ha a lot of instrumentals .
0	barbra-streisand is a great singer .
1	to my ear , this is an awesome sounding recording . it is a little bit like listening to two different band in the same room . i love the mix that they have of the orchestral music that make this track such a pleasure to listen to .
1	i have heard a lot of music and it wa time for me to get a new cd and try something new . what i got is a nice cd with a pleasant , relaxing , and positive atmosphere .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	wow , the quality of this album is very poor . i am glad that this album is out .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	this is by far the best hammond album i have ever heard . it is beautiful . i have never been so excited to find a hammond album .
0	love this song .
0	an album that is in my opinion , the very best album she ha released .
1	when i first heard this , i thought it wa the most beautiful song ever , but i found out it is a cover . but it rock , i love it .
0	i wa extremely disappointed when i heard this album . i never bought a new album by her , but because it wa out , i thought it would be something special . i wa wrong . i really liked this album , but i wa hoping for something different . i guess i will just have to buy the other jewel album , because this one is just one more disappointment .
1	i bought this album at walmart because i wa excited for the opportunity to hear kelly clarkson on her own . it turn out that she is a great singer and an even better artist . i have listened to it over and over and over .
1	a man of few word , but many thought , this man writes and speaks from the heart . his word are insightful , and the way he us his word to bring a message to the listener is interesting .
0	the song on this album are great ! all of them are great ! however , the album ha a few flaw that i wanted to address . first , the album start out with blackbird and the next song is noel . how can you play blackbird when you already played noel a couple of song ago ? secondly , when is the last time you heard sister christian played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since i have heard it , which make me think it is not the band style anymore . finally , i do not like the fact that every song begin with a song called fade away . i know that is not a coincidence , but i like the fact that the first song is titled fade away and not fade away , or fade away . when is the last time you heard garden of earthly delight played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since garden wa released , which make me wonder if it is their style anymore .
0	i just bought this cd on a whim , thinking i had to have it . it is good , but not great . i just got tired of hearing only her old song . i know she is a pretty good singer but i wa hoping to hear her take on some new song . i just wanted to hear some new song from her . it is not bad , but i just can not stand hearing her singing old stuff . i guess i will wait until she is not singing old stuff .
1	this is my first ever album and i liked it . i have to say this album is a very good mix of song .
0	i do not really like this album . it is not bad , it is not great , it is not a masterpiece . it is just okay .
1	this album is great . i wa really surprised with that . i love the song on this album .
1	i like bonnie and the rest of the reo speedwagon band and this album is great . the song are so catchy and fun , and i like that they are very different than what i am used to hearing . i am a big fan of the music industry and i really enjoyed seeing the whole band on stage in their first big concert in a long time .
0	i do not really like this album , but i do not feel like spending money on it either . i would not complain about a re-recording but i would complain that it is a re-recording of the same album - the original is much better . i do not know why keith is so popular , but he is not .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i love this christmas song and it is a great way to start the day . it is a great tune to have on your holiday playlist .
0	this album is a re-recording of the same album . keith side is a great singer , but he doe not write song . the sound quality is good , but this album is a re-recording of the same album . the original wa much better . i would have preferred to have heard the original .
0	i love this album , but when i play it , i think the song are too short .
0	first album by maria e. houghton that i ever heard . the album is truly exceptional . i am proud to have a a daughter , she is a wonderful , talented and beautiful lady . she is a fantastic musician , and i am grateful to have her a my daughter .
1	i love this album . i like how steve is able to make the music sound like he is on his own , rather than just going along with the group . i like how the song are a little more than song . this is a great album . i am a fan of this band .
0	i have listened to this album for 12 year and i still like it . the last album i bought wa the beatles and i liked that album better , but this one is a good album . it ha some good song . it is a good album . i really like it . i like it a lot . i like it a lot . i like it a lot ! it is a good album . i like it a lot . it is a good album . it is a good album . i like it a lot .
1	great song . i love this song . it is one of my favorite .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i loved this album when i wa a kid . it wa my favorite , but now it just doe not cut it anymore . it is a good album though .
1	it wa a great christmas present for my wife . it is a great gift to give .

1	this is maria best release yet . i love it ! i love maria voice . the arrangement are all great and are very well done . it is an excellent , wonderful album .

0	i like the song but i think it is a little repetitive . it is a good song , but i do not think they are good enough to be in the top 100 .
1	i have read this book twice and this is the best book i have read in a long time . it is a very good book , and will make you think about thing you may not have thought of before . it is an amazing book . there is a message in the book , but it is not preachy .
0	i bought this cd a a gift for a friend who love to sing and play piano . i will admit i like the cd , but i am not sure if i will ever buy another one . the song selection is limited ; and the album is over 2 hour . it is very poor quality . the sound quality of the recording is very poor , and the quality of the cd itself is very poor . it is very disappointing to spend this much money on a recording that will not be played in a very long time . you are wasting your money on this product . the music will play great , but there is not much of it .
1	a great version , i like it a lot .
1	this one a keeper !
0	this is the worst album i have ever spent money on . i have heard it twice now , and it is still on my computer . i do not know why it is still on my computer . it is not worth it . i am disappointed in the whole process , and i am getting the impression that it will only get worse . i would rather be reading a book or sitting at home watching tv . i really do not understand why this album is costing me so much money . it is not worth it .
1	i would highly recommend this album and even buy it for myself .
1	i do not think she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and it wa a lot of fun to listen to . i will definitely buy it !
1	just curious because i do not see any review about this cd . it is one of my favorite album .
0	i did not think that this album wa very good . i thought the song were average and did not have any good song . i can see what is going on and i got you were not good song and the album a a whole wa not worth the money .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .

0	one of my favorite album . i love the song .
0	i thought this wa a great song the first time i heard it , but after all these year it is starting to get old .
1	i bought this because it wa on sale , so i had to give it a try . i have never owned an osmond album , so i had to do my research . the album is nice and ha a few decent track , but there is not a lot of diversity in the composition . the best track is the hand and when i fall in love that came with the album . i found the album to be a little too similar to whitney houston . the album ha a few good track , but i wasnt really able to get into them . i would recommend this album , but only if you are looking for a whitney houston album .
1	this song is really good . i like this song . i really like this song . i like this song . i really like this song i really like this song . i really like this song . it is great . this song is really good . i really like this song . i really like this song i really like the guitar solo i really like the guitar solo . i really like this song i really like this song ! i really like this song i really like this song ! it is great i really like this song i really like this song ! this is really good ! i really like this song ! i really like this song ! i really like this song this is great ! i really like this song i really like this song !

1	i wa expecting something from him , and i wa not disappointed . i liked the fact that he did something different from what he had done for a long time , and i liked the fact that he did not do the usual thing .
0	this wa the first time i ever heard this song . it is really good .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	this is a new cd from a new group of young black musician . it is my first time hearing them . i absolutely love this cd . the music is good and the lyric are great . i like the group because they have a lot of variety and they are good musician . i am looking forward to listening to the rest of the album that they have made . i like the sound of this cd .

1	i have been listening to whitney houston for a long time , but i had never heard i wasnt talking about jesus . i have a very strong christian faith and i love the gospel more than anything else , but whitney is so beautiful and i will definitely listen to the gospel song with her .
0	good song .
0	this ha got to be one of the best song on this cd . it is not too long and not too upbeat . it is a nice piano melody with a very nice piano part . the vocal are nice and clear . there are some good guitar part . there are some nice piano part . the song is clean and ha a very nice piano melody to it .
1	the great song .
0	this ha to be the worst song ever . the production is horrible . the vocal are terrible and the music is awful . all the song on the album are horrible and i do not like them .
0	there are a few song that i like and a few song that i do not like . i know this album is better because i got the first cd when it came out . i do not like the song praise god . i also do not like the song beautiful and amazing . it is weird that they did not want me to have the first cd when i got the first cd .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky

1	this is a great album . i love this album . i like all the song . they are all good . i would listen to this cd every day . it is a very good album .
0	i wish i could say this wa some sort of a love letter from a great artist but it wa not . it is an interesting listen , a compilation of song and some of them are quite interesting . but the problem is the song are in 3 part and there are only 2 track for each of the part . they are all very easy to hum along with , but if you really look at the lyric you will see that most of the song have a very strong religious message in them . i am not sure i would want to listen to them all on a single cd ! but it is a good cd .
1	i downloaded this cd because i do not have much of a voice . i have to sing along to the lyric to know if i will be able to .
0	
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	this is one of my all time favorite album . i love the old school feel that this album ha . it ha some new wave in it but it is not a very popular style . but , it is good for a classic rock fan like me . i love the song the best thing that never wa and the song hound dog is my favorite .
0	very poor . the band is not a very good live band , the sound is very unclear , and the vocal are almost inaudible .
1	this is a great song , but why is it on the best of wild cd ? i know this is a cd that wa given to many musician and they were supposed to buy it for a song for free . however , i have been able to find out that this is a promotional disc that wa given to discman store for free . i would also like to know why this song wa given such a bad review by a music critic . i am not going to buy it . it ha such a poor sound quality that i am not going to listen to it again .
0	this song made me cry . but it is not a huge hit .
0	this is the best song on the album . it is a classic .
0	i am an huge fan of hers .

1	my son really really liked this song . he loved it .
0	this is very boring . i do not like it . the best song from the first two or three are the one on the first two or three . the rest is all stupid and boring . the band is not very good . i do not think i will even listen to this again .
0	this is a great album . it ha a great mix of song and style . it ha two great song , a worship song and a praise song . this is a great album . i would recommend it to anyone .

1	it is a great book . it is an original book . i will make good use of it .
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i love this album . the album contains great song , and lyric .
0	i would have given this a 5 star rating if it wasnt for a few thing . first , there is a lot of noise in the beginning . second ( and maybe the cause of the noise ) , the cd wa damaged in transit . i had to return it to amazon .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i think this song is the best song on this album . i like the song . it ha a really nice acoustic guitar sound and it go into the word very well . my favorite song on this album is lift our voice . the lyric are very good and i think the song is very well sung a well .

1	this is definitely not your typical country song . the lyric are great ! i love this song !
1	i first heard this album when i wa in high school . i wa so impressed with maria houghton singing voice , that i asked her to sing on my tape recorder . the first album i bought wa the christmas song by the carpenter . i have enjoyed every album from maria houghton that i have purchased since then .

0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .

1	the original song is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone he doe not really care about . the song is also about how he feel when he is sleeping with a person he doe not really care about . but this version is about how he feel when he is having sex with a person who doe not believe him and how he feel when he is having sex with a person he doe not really care about .

1	i got this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading song from amazon . the song on itunes are good but the song on amazon are good .
1	this is a great song , i agree with the review : it is not very long , but it is one of my favorite . i have never heard it from either of the artist , but it is worth a listen .
0	i wa an avid fan of r. kelly music for year , but after this song and the album , i felt that his music had lost it appeal . i would recommend this cd to anyone who ha loved his music until now . i would recommend this cd to anyone who loved his music .
1	this is one of the most unique album to come out in a long time . the vocal are great , the band is very high energy and the music is a little out of this world .

1	an excellent program , with some great guest . the show is very informative and ha good variety . i enjoyed this show .
0	not sure what on earth i wa thinking when i downloaded this . i downloaded it because i like their album and i am not going to waste my time listening to song that i will never get to hear . it is not like i would buy it even if i did like it . i do not even like the song . it is like listening to a song that is been played a million time and decided to take the piss out of it by playing an alternate version of the song . i do not know , it is just weird and i think the song is kind of cool . but in the end , i do not care , i do not want to listen to it . it is not like i really care what music they are making now anyway . the only thing i care about is that i do not want to waste my time listening to a bunch of song that probably will not ever be out . i am not really in a hurry to hear them anyway . i know i am going to enjoy listening to the one song i do like a little bit more . i am not going to listen to half the song and half the song that are in the middle of the album and i am going to listen to the one song that i do like a little bit more .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	karajianagreed to play an encore for his last show . the second of these wa in toronto , canada , on november 24 , 1979 .

1	i would recommend this album to anyone that like good music
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i like it and i love it ! : )
1	this is a really good album . sometimes it get boring , but it will still get your attention . i like some of the song better than others . some are good , some are not . overall i would say this is a very good album .

0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	this is a good album that ha some good song on it . it is a good album for people who want to listen to a variety of style of worship . it is a good collection of song that is not too long .
1	i like the lyric to my hero journey and my hero . i like your music . you are a very talented artist . i hope to see you in concert . hope to see you soon .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i bought some cd of this album and i have to say the music is very dissapointing and boring .
1	a masterpiece ! absolutely amazing .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is a song that will forever be a part of my life . i love it . thank you so much .
0	it sound great , but i do not think it is a good one .
1	i purchased this album on a whim after seeing it on the cover of the top album to buy . i listened to it while my husband wa out of town and it really did get me thinking and make me feel like i just lost my mind . it is a really great album , and i find r.kelly to be a very nice person .
0	this is such a good song ! it is a beautiful song and ha been on my wish list for a long time .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i think you can tell what this is about . it is about a woman who is a junkie . the more she us the drug , the more she want it . she ha no moral . she ha no goal . she ha no standard . she is nothing but a drug addict . i could put this one up next to the grateful dead song the eleven and you would not know the difference . i do not want to use this a an example of the grateful dead but i think it is a good example of the kind of music that come out of the grateful dead . this song is a classic .
0	i bought this cd for my mother in law for her birthday . she loved it . it is a great cd . the song are not bad . the cd is not bad . the music is wonderful . it is not a waste of money . she did not have too much trouble remembering the song . the main reason for buying this cd is that i know she would like to hear it again . she loved it . i know i would like to hear it again so that i could have it in my collection .
0	i really like this song . it is a really good song . it ha a good message , and i really like the lyric .
1	i like this album alot i like the song on here i am a big fan of his i think he is one of the best i i love his music
1	i love it !
0	the song on this album are very nice , but the album is very boring . the song are very repetitive and boring .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this song suck . i wish it wa longer .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	i love this song ! i have been listening to it since i first heard it . i love miley and i hope she doe not ever stop making music .
1	i love prince . i got this cd at a great price , and it ha some good tune
0	a wonderful song !
0	the cd is awesome . it ha some good song , some not a good . but that is about it . i have already sold it and bought two more of your cd . please do not take any credit for this . i can hear the song now . one of your song ha a cool background noise effect . i have never heard of that . the album is about 30 minute long and it ha six song on it . the first three are good . the last three are not so good . the song are all from the bible . the song are all biblical . the song have a slow tempo . the song are from a bible book . i found it funny that the not so good song are from the bible . the song are all about the bible . it ha a good sound and it is the kind of cd you can listen to over and over . it is a cd that you can listen to for hour .
0	this is my least favorite song . i do not even know why .
0	i loved the window phone last night . i got frustrated trying to get the camera to work and ended up switching back to my old phone .
1	just ordered this album .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i really love the song miley cyrus sings . the song is so good , i have been listening to it for a while now . i like that it doe not have a lot of word in it . it is just a song about a girl who love a guy . i hope it get a lot of airplay .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i think that you should listen the whole song .
0	this is just music for people who are in love with their car and do not know what to do with themselves . i am not sure why they even put this on their website .
0	the song is great , do not get me wrong , but unfortunately , the music video is not . i have only watched the video for i wish i could take losing you back , and it is okay . i have watched the rest of the video and they are fine . i have no problem with either of them . if you like the song , i do not think they are bad , but if you do not like them , then i think i will just have to agree with you .
1	this cd is not bad . some song are a little dull , but the song really are good . the vocal are good , but the production is not the best . i thought the playing sounded like a band , but the sound quality is not that good . i am glad that i wa not disappointed with this cd . i do like tom wait , and this cd is a good way to get more of his music . thank you for this cd .
1	barbra streisand singing is just great , i like the way she sings !
0	r kelly suck .
0	i really liked the song when i heard it on the radio ( i know , i know ) and the video is cool too .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this is one of my favorite song of all time . i like it .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?

1	this song great . i really like the original version with the guitar line . i really like the cover on the cdr . i like the new song on the cd with the live performance . the song is a good one . it is a good song . i am glad i have the cd .
0	i love the beat and the music . i like the lyric , but the rest of the song is just not that great .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this is the worst record i have ever heard . i do not know what the heck is going on with the band . i can not listen to any other band on here . i can not wait for the music to stop .
0	this is a good miley video . the song is very good . the video is very very good . the only thing i do not like about it is the video . the dancing wa a little too much . the music video wa nice . the song is the best . the video wa a little to much . i think it would be better if miley played a couple of instrument . i would like to see her try to play a guitar or something . also , i think it would be better if she played a couple of instrument for the video . the video wa a little boring to me .
1	what a great collection of music . i enjoyed listening
1	the vocal are a little weak , but the band is great . the vocal work really well with the music and really fit the song . you can tell that the band is not having a bad time while they are on stage . it will be nice to see them live again , and i hope they get another grammy nomination . i know that they will not win though . this album is like a watered down version of the band at their best .
0	this band is awesome ! the music is amazing . the band is awesome ! i love this band !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i love tom scott .
1	this is the first sam sparro cd i have listened to . i love it .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this is an awesome song . i love the song , and i think it would make a great movie or soundtrack .
0	i love this song , and i love this album , it is perfect for the fall .

1	i think this is a great jazz album .
1	i liked the first song , but i did not like the second one . i kept thinking i am glad i did not hear that song before i bought this tape , now i know to be careful .
0	this is a very good song . you can listen to it from a car radio .
0	i pre-ordered this album . but , it wa already released and i did not want to wait two week to listen to music .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this song is a bit too short .
1	i have heard a lot of the tom wait music and really like it , but this is the first one i have heard that i have enjoyed . it is not that i like his music , but i like his performance .
1	this compilation consists of a number of different artist who all did interesting thing during the late 1950s , early 1960s . the music is very well produced and the artist are all very well known . the song are of a high quality and the arrangement are all very pleasing . this compilation ha great song and a great feel to it . i really enjoyed this compilation .
1	i like the song love in vain . i like all the song on this album .
0	i like the dave clark five ! i got this album because the cover wa so beautiful . it is nice and relaxing to listen to , but i have to say i do not think it is a relaxing a some of the other cd i have .
1	i love this song . i am surprised this is not in the top ten . it is the best song on this album . i love it and wa very happy to find this on the internet .
1	great harmony super fourties group

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i wa pleasantly surprised by this album a it contains lot of music that i like . the song are really good and i like the way it wa mixed . the lyric are very well written and flow well .
1	this song rock .
1	i have heard and liked this album . i have always liked jewel . i have always loved her music .
0	i like dave clark five . they were my first favorite band when i wa young ; they are one of my favorite band .
0	a better song than the last one .
1	this is my favorite radio show .
1	i have been a fan of country and western music since i wa a small boy . i really enjoy this cd , i wish i could own it .
1	i bought this cd when it first came out . to my surprise , i actually liked it . i have listened to the cd twice , and there is nothing bad about it . it is not a hit or a hit cd . it is a fun cd with nice song .
0	this song is good , but the video is not very good .
1	this is an awesome song ! it is a little hard to find the chord so i do not know how to play it . i hope it is available online .
0	i will give this song a two star . the beat is not a good a i had hoped , but the lyric are decent and i like the fact that he sings over a very interesting beat .
0	i love this cd . i have listened to it a few time . i like the sound of the guitar and the way she sings . i love her live . i would buy this cd again . i bought this one in a hurry , too .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i have listened to her song a few time , after the first time , i wa hooked . i still can not get over it . she is just so talented !
1	i think this app is awesome ! it is a lot of work to make a song into a video on here , but it doe not matter , it is a great app !
1	i love the music of this album , and i will be playing it for my child and grandchild . i love the fact that this album sound like old school punk rock , and not like some pop rock band that i listen to . i give this album 3 star , because , for the most part , it is just a lot of punk rock , and i would not listen to it a a first date .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	this is the best beatles album .
1	i did not think some good year wa a country song , but it is . i will be adding this to my collection . i love i am so lonesome i can cry . it is a favorite of mine .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this is an all-around fantastic album . the arrangement are extremely well-crafted . the music is interesting and varied . it is not a if they are trying to reinvent the wheel , or try to take the music to a completely different genre of music . this is just the way that they are in their music .
0	it sound like a chapbook that ha been passed around in a circle from room to room . the lyric are not really relevant to the music , nor is there really a message . it ha a strong , yet very annoying , sound effect . the song is not that good . i have listened to it maybe 100 time in the past three year and have not listened to it since it wa released . i think you should go to the video store , and get one of her other song .
1	i purchased this for my son and it is great . i love the cd . my son love this cd .
1	the first song is very relaxing . there are a few other song that are very good . i would recommend this album . it is a very nice album .

1	this is my all time favorite . if i could , i would like to say that i love this song . i would like say that i love this song .
0	i did not like the song at all and i thought it wa very boring . the chorus wa very good , but after that the song just fell flat . i thought that it would be better if the chorus wa not there at all . i thought the first part of the song wa ok and then after that it just felt like i just did not understand what wa going on and i just thought it wa too long .
1	i love it . this is a great christmas song to sing . i love it . i love it . i love the fact that i can sing this to my family . i believe this is a great christmas song .
1	i like the i love the way the lyric have the melody in the background part ! it make the song more interesting !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i bought this cd a a christmas gift for my daughter . i will probably buy the cd again and will be purchasing the cd again for the cd of the year .
1	i love the way the lyric have the melody in the background . i like to sing along with this song .
1	i think that this is a good album , but a lot of song are repetitive and boring .
0	i am really disappointed that this song wa not on the album . it is a great song , but it just did not fit the album .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i love to listen to this song when i am doing my tax .
0	this is not a bad album at all . it is not a good a the other two release though . the sound is ok , but not great . the lyric are ok but they are not a good a the other two album . the vocal are ok but not a good a the other two album . overall a very mixed record .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i have had several different tom wait cd . i have purchased several different tom wait cd . i have had several different tom wait cd . i have had several different tom wait cd . this is by far the best tom wait cd i have ever heard . and i have heard quite a few .

1	i have been a fan of a tribute to the late , great curtis mayfield . a a fan of the music i listen to this album very carefully . it is not just a collection of cover , it is also a true tribute to the genius of curtis mayfield .
1	this wa one of the best song ever .
0	she is very talented .
0	i don ; t think this album is for everyone . i think this album is good , and i would like it to be better .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this song is pretty darn good . it is a pretty good song to dance to .
1	this song is a little bit slow and a little bit fast . it is a little different from the rest of the album but it is not bad . i like them best of the song on the album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	great cd , love the tune of uptown funk but the rest of the cd wa not a good a the first cd i have listen to this cd , i also like the first cd i have played this cd a lot

0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	a wonderful , relaxing , and very good recording . i enjoyed listening to this on a boat cruise on the hudson river .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i love these song .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i find it a live version of the song , because the vocalist are playing and singing the song , and the people singing are not acting , but they are singing , and they are singing along to the song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i like the dave clark five . i am a big fan . of course , i listen to them every day . they are great . i like this album . it is one of my favorite . i would listen to it all the time . i would recommend anyone to listen to it .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i really love this album . it is soooooo good .
1	this is a compilation of a number of song by the beatles which were released on the lp the beatles ( the white album ) that wa released in 1968 .
0	i don ; t know what they are talking about . i do not think you need to know what the movie is , but it would help if you did . and i do not understand why you say it is the same song when it really is not . maybe i am not understanding what you are saying .
0	their music ha always been good to me . i love the dave clark five . i like listening to their music . i like listening to the dave clark five . i like the song and i like the music . robert
1	i like this album a lot . i think you will like it too .
1	i have listened to this song so many time that i have decided it is a pop song . it is catchy and the chorus sound fun . the first time i listened to this song , i just could not believe that i had actually heard it before . i have heard other song like this , but none that i like . it sound like a pop song , but i think it is better . enjoy .
1	the album wa very good . i really like the song on this album . they are all different , but it is always good to have an album like this . i also like the song my god is real and he is got it . i think they are very good . they stand out because the others could not . i like the song i am going home , i have got you , he is got it , my god is real , and the reason . i am glad that this cd ha a message about god and that he is real . it also ha a message about the love of god . i like the message about the love of god . it is very good . i hope you do too .
1	i like barbra streisand and i think she is really good . the song is good and i do not know why anyone would change the lyric , but it is a great song . i like the song , but i do not know if it is a hit song .
0	this is one of the best hymn i have ever heard . i am in awe of the music and word , and the way the singer sound . it is a great hymn to sing when i feel low , and it really help me get back to a place of complete confidence .
0	i have heard a lot of the dave clark five cd , and have never been disappointed with them . this one wa one of their best and i wanted to give it a 5 star rating . but in the end , i have to give it a 3. it just doe not live up to the rest of the dave clark five . this one wa a song , and they did not get much of a chance to do it . they were a great group and they recorded many great song , all of which i can still remember . but this one ha to go down a a let down . i do not think they will ever get there . it is just not there .
0	a really great album , if you are a fan of jewel . the singing is good , but the song themselves are not . jewel wa doing the song , but she did not sing it the way it should be sung .
1	i really like it . it is a great song . i would like to buy it on the cd .

0	this is a very good album . i enjoyed it very much .
0	the lyric here , i love it .
1	this album is amazing
1	this collection is a great compilation of song . it ha all the song from the movie . it ha many very good song . it is wonderful . i give it a 10/10 .
1	another very good album , i love the keyboard and the guitar , i love the vocal and the guitar solo , but i have found that there are better song that i have heard . the only reason i gave it a 9 is because i like the production , but i do not think the album is that good . the vocal are a bit annoying with the raspy note .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this album ha a great sound and great lyric . i think it is a beautiful album . i really like it . it is my new christmas gift .
1	a fantastic album , i have been listening to it for over 20 hour , just can not get enough . it is one of the best album i have heard in a long time . i love the deep , rich , and smooth vocal of the two lead vocalist . this album hold a special place in my heart .
1	this is one my favorite album of the year . i really enjoyed this album and wa disappointed that all the song were very short . i am very glad i bought this album . i would have liked to have heard more of the song .

1	i love this song . it is a great song . it is a great song . it is a great tune . it is a great tune .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	i love this album . this is probably the 4th or 5th album i have purchased this year . i have always been a fan of this album . the last album that i purchased wa the way we were by the backstreet boy , but this one is better than that .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i think this is one of wait better album . i like the song . i like the musicianship . it is not a great album , but it is a good one .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i have not had a chance to listen to the cd yet so i do not have an opinion . i will listen to it for sure though . i would rate it 2 star if i could , but i have to listen to it first .
0	i love the vocal and the guitar work , but the song just seems to lack the energy and confidence . i do not like the lyric - or the song . the song is too predictable . the bass , drum , and keyboard all have a generic sound that just doe not fit the song .
0	i wa not a fan of his music until i got into a car accident in september 2003. i wa so angry and depressed , i bought all of oheards album and downloaded the entire cd-rom from the hospital . i had some of these cd in my car throughout the entire time i wa in the hospital . i then went to the hospital and watched the cd in the nurse station ( a nurse wa playing them to a group of u there ) and realized how much i loved them . i never thought i would be so happy to own a cd of my favorite singer . i also went back to the hospital after the accident and listened to saint and i wan na be your dog in the hospital room . i wa so happy to hear these cd and feel better . i have all of his album , from the first cd to the newest , and i still have all of his cd in my car .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i do not listen to tom scott enough but this album caught my attention when it wa first released . it wa a bit hard to listen to at first , but i actually found myself enjoying these tune more and more a the album went on . they are not necessarily unique but they are very well done and have a lot of energy to them . i have listened to this album a lot and i am glad to say i did not get bored of it . it is a great album to have on when you want to get down with your friend and when you want to dance and have some fun . i would recommend this to any tom scott fan and to anyone who like a good mixture of pop and rock .
1	i remember listening this song while sitting at a cafe in munich , germany . the very first time i heard it . i wa in germany for a conference and listened to this on a bus . that wa the first time this song wa heard by me .
0	it is good .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	she ha a great voice .
1	i do not know if it is just my bias , but reo speedwagon is definitely a great band . one of the best band i have ever heard . i love the band and i love the music . maybe that is why i do not like their album . however , i feel like this album is better than the first one and i like the song better too .

0	this is not a good song . i do not even like it , it sound like a bad song .
1	the song itself is a good song though , i like it . the song is simple but it ha a nice beat . it is a good song to listen to . just like i like listening to the beatles , i like listening to this song . it is different , it is good , and it is a nice song . i do not know if i would buy this cd , but i would listen to it though .
0	i love this song , and i love this song video . this is one of my faves from the cd .
1	this song ha a great arrangement .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	barbra streisand is great . she ha a voice that is unique and that is not easy to find . her voice is not what you would necessarily expect from her . i like her music . i do not know which one is better . i like both . i am not sure which one is better . who know , she is new to this whole concept . i like the new album a well , but it is different . i do not know which one is better to me .
1	this album ha some of the best music i have ever heard in my life . i listen to this album every day . i feel like i am listening to live music .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	this cd ha no good song . it is just a bad cd .
0	it is a really silly song , but it is catchy at the same time . it is not bad at all , but i do not think i will listen to it again .

0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	this cd ha a nice voice . i can not figure out why more people do not like it .
0	this is the first of two disc i bought , the other being the double-cd version of out of step . now , there are a lot of people who have bought both , and i have been told that the double-cd version is superior , so i am using the first disc , but i wish it wa more .
1	this is one of the best trance album that i have ever heard . it ha it all . you can expect a lot of variety , but this album will definitely keep you dancing and making you wonder . i am not sure why everyone is praising this album so much , but i have to agree . i have been listening to this for the past 4 day , and i am still amazed at this album . the music is very good , and it ha a nice variety to it . i like that the album is very long . the last few track are amazing . not to many artist are left out . i had to listen to this album over and over again in order to be able to hear every single song . i am very impressed with this album . it is worth the money that you paid for it . i would recommend this album to anyone who like to dance and listen to great trance music .
1	i like this cd . i bought it at the recommendation of my husband . this is a great cd for everyone . my only problem
0	not his most favorite .
1	i love this cd !

0	i am a little bored with this cd . i only listened to it for a couple of minute . it wa a little too in-your-face and did not say much . i had the cd for a few day and listened to it . it reminded me of a rock band . the vocal are terrible and the music is boring . the only good thing about this cd is that it is free ! i really do not understand why anyone would pay $ 5 for something that is free . at least the cover is nice . it is very cute and it look like it is made of something other than plastic . it wa like a scratch & dent type of cover . it doe have a decent picture though . i gave it 4 star . if you are the type that like to listen to music and you are not fond of listening to a lot of boring song then this should be your first choice . i am not sure why anyone would bother paying $ 5 for a free cd . this is not a bad cd . i give it 4 star .
1	great lyricism , great music and great message . i like lareine a lot .

0	this song is great . i love the music . it make me want to dance . it make me want to sing . this is the best song i have ever heard , period .
0	what a waste of money . after i decided to get the album for my birthday , i found out that it wa the same cd that had been on my ipod for month . i am not sure if it is the cd or the ipod .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i would recommend this cd to anyone who like the dave clark five .
0	the album is a waste of money . i can not listen to it for long .
0	this cd is nothing but a lot of annoying singer who sound like they are from a radio show . i have a lot of relaxing music on my player .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i want to read it on my ipad but i can not because the library is full . this one is my favorite song and it is sad because i have to say it is the first album i have ever owned , and i do not know how to listen to music . the other song are nice , but i just like this song better .
0	this cd is excellent . it is a good collection of song , with some of them that are very good , and some that are not so good . the music is from the old school jazz and blue . it is very well done . i have only listened to the cd once . i will buy this again and listen to it to make sure that it is everything that it should be .
1	there is a song that you can listen to on youtube . it is a very good song . it is called somewhere out there . it ha 2 verse and 1 chorus . when you listen to the song , the chorus is very repetitive and the verse have too many line . i do not like it because the chorus is repetitive . the verse is good because it is shorter , the chorus is repetitive , and the bridge is good . i like the bridge a lot . the verse are good because they are short and the chorus is repetitive . also , the tempo of the chorus is slow . but the bridge is good . the verse have too many line , but it is not bad because it is short . the song ha very good lyric . it is good that you can listen to the song on youtube . however , you can not listen to it like this . you have to listen to it slow , and pause between each line . and the vocal sound good . i like the song . but you have to do it this way . it is not the way you should listen to it . i hope you will listen to the song again with this method . you should play it with the same method you play it now . because the sound is good and the tempo is slow . but the repetition is bad . and the word are repetitive . the reason i do not like the repetition is because the verse are short . i like the bridge a lot . it is short and the voice is nice . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . it is not like the song is played 2 billion time . it is only played once . i hope you listen to it again with like this . it sound good and you can hear the difference between the original song and the cover version . you should listen to the song with this method . it will sound better than the original . the reason i do not like the chorus is because it is repetitive . i hope you listen to the song again with this method . it will sound better than the original . also , you should listen to it with this method . it will sound better than the original . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . and the song is played 2 billion time . it is only played once if you listen to it with this method . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . this song is great , but you have to do it this way . the tempo is slow , and the repetition is bad . the reason i do not like the repetition is because the verse and the chorus are repetitive . it is not the same because the verse are small . i like the bridge because the verse is short . i like the chorus because they are short . also , the bridge is short . and the bridge is good . the chorus
0	i am new to lorde , and i thought it would be a good album to get while i am stuck in a hotel or something . i bought the album , and it wa actually a really good album , but all the song are kind of the same .
1	i just bought this cd because i wa told that it wa a rare release by the band . i wa not aware of the band prior studio album , but i thought this cd would be a good addition to the collection of their first studio session . i wa not disappointed . i am a classic rock fan and this cd is excellent . i bought it in hope of the band releasing a new studio album in the future .
1	i wish i could listen to this album again and again . the song is really good . the lyric are about loving god and being thankful for him . it wa nice to hear the song sung by barbra , instead of just spoken by her . the sound quality is really good . i think it is a very good album . it ha great music and great lyric .
0	i love to sing this hymn at wedding , because it is a good time for everyone to be singing .
0	i have listened to this song a few time and it is still not a good song . the melody is pretty , but everything else is missing . it is a good song , but not a good example of a rocker song .
0	i heard this cd for the first time this morning , at the gym . the first thing i noticed wa how it sounded like a bad mix of a mix . the second wa the way it sounded to me . it had a really bad sound to it that i did not like . but then , after a good 30 minute of listening to it , i heard a song on the radio i knew and love and i just listened to it . it took me back to the day of listening to my favorite radio station in high school . but this time , there wa a twist in the story - the station wasnt in the same city anymore . but i really liked the sound of the vocal on this song . and i liked the way it sounded a if it wa recorded in a small room . i just do not think it is that good . i think it would be better with a different vocalist . i have a lot of friend who like this song . i do not . i think i should get it back and let them give it another listen . i just do not like the sound of the vocal on this recording .
0	this is one of the few cash song i have not heard .
0	it is an interesting radio show .

0	this is not a bad song , but it doe not have a good beat .
0	the only reason this song will get any play on this site , even in a negative review , is that it is one of the only non-original jewel disc i have ever heard . she wa never on that level . she is a very underrated singer and performer , and this is a very good song .

1	great compilation . this album ha all the song from the movie . it is a very beautiful collection of song . i give it a 9.9/10 .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	i have been a fan of this band since the beginning . i have loved the music for many year , and have bought many good album . this album is a classic .

1	i wa so excited to find this artist music on this site . i love the sound of this artist music . i am glad i found them . he is an amazing artist . really enjoyed this song and the music video too . very inspirational .
0	i have not listened to jp recently , but this is a great album , especially i will fly away . he also play some great solo on the last couple of track of the album . i am very disappointed that the song ave maria is only about half way thru . i liked the song and the soloing on it , but it just seems to end on a whim , a if jp wa done . it doe not seem to have any ending whatsoever , and the soloing seems to end with the last note . i am sure he would have liked the song , but i am not sure why it wa so drastically cut .
0	i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not disappointed . the sound quality is good and it is a very good cd . i have heard some good cd before and this is one of my favorite .
0	i like the song and the video , but the song and video were not a good a i thought they were . i thought that the first part of the song wa ok and then after that it just fell flat . the second part of the song wa very good and then after that it just fell

0	very good song
0	amazon.com ha a few selection of song that are good . they are not bad , but they are not outstanding .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	i like gim me shelter a lot .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i have a feeling this song is going to be very popular in the blue circle . in fact , i think it will be a hit .
0	i picked this up today . the only song i have heard so far is the title track . it is a great song . i wa excited about this album for a while . i wa hoping for a little more , but after listening to the album , i find that i am still very happy . the song are very good a well . i wa really disappointed that the cd had to be shipped out immediately after i placed my order . i wa hoping for a little more time to find out what i really wanted to listen to . i think i will enjoy the album for now , but i know i will want to see them in the future .
1	i have listened to many version of this song , and this one is by far the best ! this is a song that is very difficult to put into word , and i hope you enjoy this performance .
0	this is one of my favorite song ever . i love this song . i have been listening to this song all day . i love it . i have listened to it over 100 time already and i can not stop listening to it . it is like a drug . i feel like i can not stop listening to it . i feel like i have been waiting for this forever . it is like the perfect song . it is so awesome , i do not know what it is about this song . i do not know how i feel about this song . i do not know why i love it so much . i feel like i should like it , but i do not . i feel like i should hate it , but i do not . i feel like i should be sad , but i am not .
1	i really enjoy listening to ohearsns music . it is very relaxing and very soothing . his music is very soothing and very relaxing . it is very soothing and very relaxing . it is very soothing and very relaxing
1	i like the cd . i love the music .
0	i have a problem with this album , and i am not sure why . i think it is the vocal . there is nothing i can say about them that can not be said better in the word of the song . i do not like the lyric , either . they are too long , too repetitive , and have nothing to do with the content of the song . i do not care what people say about this record - it is the best sam sparro album i have heard .
1	this is cool . this is cool . i like this song .
0	i love this song . it is a great song . i would definitely buy it again .
0	i love it . it is simple , yet powerful .
1	i love this cd , and i love the singing , and i love the lyric , and i like the fact that it is not a christmas cd . the only reason i did not give it 5 star is that it is very hard to understand and you can just tell that it wa recorded by a couple of really dumb people . if you want to hear a christmas cd , go buy a christmas cd . if you want to hear a cd with a few song with christmas in the title , go buy a cd with a few song with christmas in the title . this aint it . if you want to hear the sound of an album where the singer sound like he is singing in church and the band sound like they are playing in a high school gym , then this is what you want . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . you know what ? go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd .
0	this is a great band . i love the music . the vocal are very good and the instrumentals are great . i really like this band . they are very good live . the song are fun and not too much . if i had to pick one song it would be if you could only see me for sure .
0	nice . it is a nice compilation . it is a little off the wall . however , i do like the song the green dragon ( and the album is worth checking out if you have never heard it ) .
1	this is a good song . i do not really like the song . the sound quality is good . the song ha a very positive and happy tone , and i really enjoy it .
0	i am a fan of this artist . i do not really like the music .
1	i have just started listening to the dave clark five and wa amazed at how good their music is . they are a band i would like to hear more of . i think they have a lot more to offer than just these three album . i do not think they need a full band , but they could certainly use a couple of drummer .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	this cd is not worth the price .
0	i bought this cd because i thought it wa going to a different place . instead , it is just a rehash of the same song . i am a fan of jewel , but i am not a fan of this type of pop music . this cd is overrated .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this album is amazing !
0	the only reason i downloaded this cd wa to listen to the lyric while i wa driving to school . it is a shame that i have to listen to it at school .

1	i have always been a fan of uptown funk , but i would never heard the original . this is an awesome version of the song . it is great for a party , it is just funky and fun !
1	when i heard this song i started to cry .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i wa just listening to this on the radio and thought that i had heard this song before . i then realized i had never heard this song on the radio . i loved it .
1	i am a big fan of the beatles , so i can understand why this album is so good : i mean , i am not sure i would have ever heard anything like this before . this album reminds me of some of the best beatles i have heard . i also like the song the beatles because it is very catchy .

0	this album of bruno mar is unbelievable ! i have never heard this song before , but i love it !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i had a lot of trouble with this album . i wa trying to find a song i really liked so i could not enjoy the whole album . it wa not a good a i thought it would be . i have to give it to hasselvander for his talent . it is a good album , but i can not stand the opening track . i am sorry , but i have had it .
0	this cd is very , very good . i like the way the song are arranged . i like the way the song are written . i like the way there is no drum . the voice is very good and clear . the song praise is what i do is a very nice song . i like the song jesus love you , my savior and the cross . the song lord i am god is very , very good and very well sung . i like the lyric for i am god . i liked the song it is a place in the heart but it wa too quiet and i did not like the song god of love at all .
0	i do not think this song is very good . i do not really like it .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	i have only heard the cd a couple of time , but i like it . i am looking for a cd to listen to while watching football .
1	i went to the store and found this cd and it wa right , like the song said , right there and i just love it . i love it because i love the song . i love it because the singer is so beautiful . i love it because it wa a christmas gift and i love it . i even love it because a song i like had a little part in it . i would not have known it wa a christmas song if it wasnt for the little part in it . i love it because it is a christmas song and i know it is gon na be a christmas song for a long time .
1	lorde definitely ha a great voice . lordes song is one of the best to come out recently . i love this song and i love lordes voice .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	my favorite song on the cd is take your time it is a very nice song to listen to when you are waiting for a bus .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	this album is the only beatles album i have ever heard and i love it
0	this is a song that wa played on the radio by a long-time rock station in the early 1970s . it wa part of a program , but i really liked the original version better than the one on this cd . i used to drive by the little radio station on my way to and from work every day and see this song , almost every time , when i would pas by . it is not bad . a little boring . it is just a song . it is the kind of song that you listen to while waiting or just to have something to watch while you wait . i love it and i love the song . it is a good song . this cover is pretty bad . there is no real reason to use this song . this just seems like another attempt to cash in on a hit . it doe not work and it is just a bad version of a classic .
1	i would say that this album is good , but not great . i have heard so many people praise this album , but i just do not think it is that good . i would say that the album is good , but it just doe not seem to have the music to last . the song are good , but they just do not last . i
0	i am not sure what i expected , but this cd ha nothing for me . i do not appreciate the lyric or the music , it is all about the vocal . the singer do not sing the way i like them to .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	a collection of the best song and performance from the career of the legendary songwriter and producer , alan price . the collection cover his work on the beatles , genesis , rod stewart , dire strait and others . in a word , it is an encyclopedia of great music .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this is a great album . i love the cover , the song , and the album itself . very enjoyable .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i love this album , and have been singing , and listening to it , since the day it wa released . i agree with the reviewer that the music is beautiful , but i disagree with the review that it ha no message . i think that the message of the album is very important . the message is very important , and it is more than just one song . the message of the album can be summarized a christ is the only answer to all our problem . i love the song praise god because all of the word used in the song are taken from scripture . they describe a picture of a savior that we should be looking for , someone who is greater than our self . and then on the song my savior , she make a very personal statement about her savior and how very much that she love him . i just want to praise you , praise you , praise you , praise you . i am sure that a great many people have been touched by this cd , and there are many others . but , i love this cd because i can sing along to it , and i can feel the emotion it stir . i also love the way that she sings the song . the way that she sings is very personal . she is so expressive . it feel like she is speaking directly to me . and , the way that she sings , she is able to put the word that she sings into my heart . she is able to speak to my heart ; she can say to my heart ; i love you . i think that i may have just found the perfect cd . i have also heard that she ha recorded a book that ha been published by crossway book . i hope that they are able to release this cd . i can not wait to hear it . i do not have any more to say . i hope that you find this review helpful .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this album i bought it is very good .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	the only song i have heard by this group that i actually liked wa black and gold . this song is good , but the voice is really annoying and i do not like the sound .
0	my wife and i both love the dave clark five and jewel music . i have always loved jewel music and have enjoyed her album and her early song . i would like to have an album of their earlier song by them but i do not think it will ever happen because the song have already been recorded . i want to be able to listen to their song when i am not looking and have not heard them .
0	this is a very well done cover of a great song . i found out about this song and the artist from a blog post . i wa so excited to see this song and this artist on my computer and i can not wait to buy this cd . thanks for adding this to the cd store .
1	this song sound so good and i think it is so good to hear it on my computer ! i am glad she did it to it ! i like it and i like the cover .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	this is just a really good country song . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true fan of country music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always searching for a song that brings him closer to god . this is a great song to listen to when you want to be closer to god .
1	i listen to this a lot . i like it a lot . i like his lyric . i like the music . i like the vocal . i do not like the lyric . i think this album is great .

1	i bought this cd for my wife . i love it . it is about a man who try to get back with his ex-wife .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i don ; t know why , but i love this cd . it is like a song book . there are so many song . they are well written and the message ha a lot of meaning . i am a fan of this artist .
1	a good , old-fashioned country song by a fine group of friend . i would like to hear more of their music .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music

1	this is the first single off the new album . i like the sound of it . it is an oldie , but a goodie .
0	this is a great song to listen to on a sunny day .
1	it wa worth the download . i would recommend this song to others .

0	i really like it .
1	i am a huge fan of the broadway musical a chorus line ; this is one of my favorite song ! i have listened to a few of the album and this one is my favorite !
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	one of the better mike varney tribute/cover album . the song are good but the song are too long . the song about a man who could not love his wife and she would not leave him is a really good song . i could not love you and you could not leave me is a great song . this is not a bad album , it is just really short .
1	this is a great jazz cd . i enjoyed listening to this . i like jazz and classical jazz . john coltrane is the best jazz artist to listen to . i love listening to his music .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this cd is a really good song . it is a little out of key . it is not outstanding . the only reason it is worth a rating is because it is free and it is the story of a christmas carol . otherwise i would give it a negative review . it ha a strong melody that can be enjoyed by many people . the lyric are silly . the sound quality is excellent ; the song is very clear . the only problem is the vocal . they are just terrible . the song is very hard on the ear . the cd quality is good . the music is well-crafted and the song is very enjoyable . it ha great lyric . this cd ha a good sound quality . the cd is easy to listen to . there are some good lyric . the cd is worth the money . after listening to this cd for a little while i feel like i have learned something . i give it a rating of 5 star .
0	this wa the first song i got in the car and listened to when i got home . it is a great song , and i really like it . my favorite part is the part about the bird . it seemed to bring me back to my childhood . there is a line in the song that say in my life i have been lucky if i have been lucky enough to see one bird . that is why i love it .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this song should be in the movie . very good .
1	i bought this cd because i am a huge fan of the show and sam sparros song rise up which is my all time favorite song .
1	i love gwen stefani , i grew up a fan of her music and this song is a lot of fun to listen to .
1	i have a lot of fond memory of listening to my dad playing the you have got a friend and for you album . for some odd reason , i have always assumed these were for my dad ( and i am pretty sure my dad did not know that i actually bought them ) . i wa very sad to hear that he bought these album for me , but i guess it is okay , because they are all still here . and i will never forget the day he brought home a new album , you have got a friend by paul mccartney , and i wa so excited for it . i could hear that it wa the new album and i thought it wa so much better than the old one . i also remember the time i finally got my first cd player and i wa thrilled to find out my dad had bought this album for me . i had heard the song on the radio , but had never seen them in print , so when i saw that it wa a brand new , brand new album , i told him the album had to be mine , and he said he knew right then and there that i would be the first to have this new album . my dad wa always very interested in music and in music history , so i suppose he just thought it wa a gift . he listened to some song on the album and then , after some conversation , he brought the album into the living room and played it for me . i wa very excited to hear the song and i loved them . when i listened to the album again , though , i started to hear the song in my head ( that is how they start , you know ) , so i just stopped playing the album . i did not like the album , and i did not like the song that i heard in my head . i had a lot of anger and hurt inside me and i felt like i had lost my father . i did not know why , but i felt like i would lost my dad somehow , and i hated that album and everything it symbolized . and then , that night , i wa listening to the album again and it wa the first time i had really listened to the album in quite a while . i wa still upset but i wa listening to the song in my head and i could not understand something that i wa hearing , and it made me so sad . i ended up playing the album for the first time in a really long time , and i could hear the song in my head , and i wa really annoyed . i wa very upset with the album and i hated it . i wa really upset with myself for not listening to it in a long time , and i felt like i had let my dad down , not listened to the album in a long time and not played it for my dad . so i ended up playing it for the second time in a really long time , and i wa really annoyed . i felt really bad and i hated the album . but it wa the only album i had ever played for my dad and i wa really mad at myself for not listening to it in a long time and playing it for my dad , and yet , i wa really mad at the album and i hated it . i really hated the album and my dad for buying it for me , and i felt really good about myself for buying it . i decided that i would really like to listen to the album again , so i went into the bedroom and listened to the album . i wa really annoyed by the album and i hated it .

1	i have now listened to about half of the song on this collection . i have to say , that these song are all very enjoyable and have some excellent music . marie is not a great singer , but her voice is very beautiful . she sings with a wonderful , clear , and clear voice . i believe the best singer are those who can sing in several different way . marie can sing easy and then she can switch to her harder side and i find this admirable .
1	praise ! is a worshipful worship album by allan bole . this album is for those who want to worship but are just not sure where to begin . the song are filled with praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , prayer , and worship . the lyric are very well-written , and fit the song . there are a few other song that i will have to give a more in-depth review on , but for now i will say that praise ! is a great worship album and it will take you on a journey .

1	this album is just a great recording of her music . there are only a couple of song that are really bad , but the majority of the song are great . the song are great , and they all have a consistent feel to them . what make jewel music really stand out is the fact that she ha amazing musicianship . these guy are good . it is obvious they play their instrument well . they can play almost any style of music , and they can do it without a problem . i wa worried that they would do a song that wa a little different or a little too slow , but they played them in perfect time and in a way that really made the song stand out . the song are great , the vocal are great , and i love the musicianship . i am glad i bought this cd over the year . i have been buying jewel album since 1998 , and the only cd i have been able to get to is this one . i just love this album .

1	this album is all around great ! the production is awesome , and the tune are well-written . it is a good time listening to it , because it really encourages you to move on from your trouble and to be happy . there is something for everyone to enjoy . the d.l.l .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this album is a great one . it is a collection of song that are all about love . there are a couple of good tune here that are easy to listen to . but , some of the tune are a little repetitive . the vocal are nice . they are just a little too much , which is an issue on song that have a lot of repetition . but , overall , this is a great album .
1	i love how she sings in the song the world is yours .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .

0	i can understand why i can not get this cd to play on my ipod . it is terrible .
1	i do not like the song when i hear it in my head , but then when i hear it on the radio , i like it . i have also liked some of the song , but i only like the one when i hear them in my head . this song is the exception to the rule . i think i will like it better on the radio .

1	i like this band
1	this is the best song ever !
1	this set includes the song from the dave clark five entire discography . they were one of the most influential jazz vocal group . they blended alot of great music and sound with their own unique talent and style . the dave clarkfive were one of the most important jazz vocalgroups to ever come out ofthe new york city area . they were very versital , but they were always at their best on the ballad andlove song . the dave clarkfive wa the original band that played the song of the decade , including severalof the biggest hit of the era . this cd contains song that arepart of the dave clark five entire discography . i highly recommend listening to this set to fullyunderstand the dave clark five and the legacy of the dave clarkfive .
1	i love this cd , the original first i have heard of it , the lyric are great and the song title are funny , the music is great , and i like the song hey baby the most .
0	i do not know what to think about this song . i wa listening to it in the car and then i wa listening to the same song on the radio . it wa still good .
0	not the most melodic album i have heard , but i like it . it is quite good . there are a few song that are not what i originally expected , but the cd is still a good listen to .
0	i have seen this song a few time and i think it is very good . and yes , it is a bit over the top , but it ha a great groove and a catchy chorus . so i give it a 4 star rating .
1	this album is great ! i love it .
1	this is my first jewel album and i am glad i found it . this is jewel best album so far . i listened to it over and over and over . i am glad i found it .
1	i wa surprised at how good this one is . i have been a fan of her since her first album , but i have not been able to get her to come out with much . this one is a great song . it is just one of those song that you can not get enough of . it is just one of those song that you can not put enough of .
1	i think this is a good song . it is more of a fast rock song but it is not over the top cheesy . the drum are good , and the guitar are decent . the lyric make sense and i do not mind that the song is on a treadmill !
1	the original wa not on youtube , and i wa looking for it for some time .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this album ha a great sound . great lyric . love the beatles .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is a nice album . it ha some interesting part , but the only song that ha potential is moonlight serenade and that only last for 2 minute , and the rest is very repetitive . i think the album would have been better if the song were longer , and there wa more variety . the most positive thing about this album is the quality of the sound , especially the vocal . the only thing negative about this album is the song are too short .
0	this is an interesting tune . the lyric are good , but the melody is somewhat corny .
0	gay trance is not for everyone but for those that like trance and love music of the 60 and 70 it is the best album of the entire series .
0	i really liked this song . it is a good song . it is a good song for a wedding ceremony .
1	this is my favorite cd of 2014. it is a great album for all age . i have been a christian for 42 year , and have always been a fan of worship song . it is always been my favorite genre . i always thought i would like the music of hillsong until i heard this album . the music is beautiful . i have never heard the song being sung like this . the vocal are very powerful . the music is very uplifting . it is an amazing album . i am glad i bought the album . i am glad i got it . i am glad i bought it . i am glad i got it . i am happy that i got it . i am happy that i got it . i am glad that i got it . i am glad that i got it . i am glad that i got it . i am glad that i got it . this is a great album . i have listened to the song i am glad a million time . i love it . this is a great album . i love the sound of this cd . this is a great album . i really like this album .

1	this is my favorite song she ha done so far . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice . i like the fact that she doe the song in her own voice . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice , which is different from her other song . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice ; it show that she is an artist and an artist ha the freedom to express herself without being forced into making a song that is popular . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice - it show that she is an artist and an artist ha the freedom to create her own music without being forced into making a song that is popular . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice - it show how much she love the song , and how much we love the fact that she sings a song in her own voice .

0	wow . i have been listening to this song for a long time and it wa always my favorite . the lyric are great and the melody and harmony are great . i like the song and the music , but i hate this version of the song . the version of the song on the cd is the same a the old one and not the new one i have heard . the song is amazing but i do not like the version they have used . i have been listening to this song for a long time and i have not heard the new version . it is just not the same song . i wish they would at least use the new version .
0	it is not the same song in the movie . the movie version is more relaxing .
0	i have got the original version of this on itunes , but there is a cover that wa recorded that i would really love to buy .

0	she doe a good job with her voice , but she is not a consistent a i would like .

0	really , really good ! my daughter really enjoyed it .

1	i love jp and this album .
0	i used to like this , i do not really like it , it is just one of those song that i have to listen to .
0	i have listened to this twice , and i am still having trouble getting into the music . there are time i can hear thing that are good , like the soloing on mermaid in love , but i am not sure about the music . there is nothing that stand out to me a a significant difference between this music and the music i listen to in my personal listening experience . it is good music ; there are some great solo on this cd , but i am not hearing any music that change my experience of the music . there are some great vocal on the cd , but it is not a rock album . i am not sure what jp is trying to accomplish with this cd - he is trying to be a musician , but it is not coming across to me .

0	a very enjoyable song . the chorus is kinda catchy but i do not really like it a much a the other song in the album . it is a little repetitive but not too bad to the point that it annoys me and i can not stand it . it is a lot better than when you hear the beat , but it doe not compare to let u do the time warp , which is one of my favorite song .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	this is a great recording of the concert . i have the album for the first three song , and then i got distracted by the others . the sound quality is good , and the crowd is pretty good , but it is a little too loud and not a loud a the best recording i have heard . i think i would have preferred a better sound to this one .
1	it is a good song to listen to while you are driving . it is very easy to get bored with .

0	great album , but it ha too many song . the song are very repetitive and boring . maybe i just have a hard time remembering the song , but it is very rare that i listen to a cd without having to listen to it again and again .
1	i love this song ! i love the fact that it is a good song , and the melody is great . i actually like the song , and i am glad i have found it ! i am not sure if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song ! i guess i will have to get the cd . it is one of the few song i bought that i am glad i bought .

0	love the lyric , love the music , love the overall quality of this album , love the packaging but the cd drive doe not seem to hold up that well , i think the cd drive for the cd is flimsy .

1	i like the first song , but i can not really understand the hate for it .
0	this is a great song , it is on the movie , this is just another example of how bad they are . this is not the same song even tho it is the original i can tell you that .
1	i enjoy barbra streisand . i really do . i love her voice . i admire her and her voice . she is one of my favorite singer . so , to say i am a fan is an understatement .
0	i thought this wa a good cd but i do not know why , after listening to it for about 10 minute , i started thinking of how i would feel in a situation like the one the song describes .
0	this song make me want to dance .
1	this is a very good cd . it ha great band at a very good price . i am a grateful dead fan for year and year , but it wa time to upgrade to something new . this is it . i bought this album and put it on while i wa on vacation . i wa very impressed with the quality . i would buy it again in a heartbeat . i bought it when i found it in my dad collection , but he bought it a few day ago , when i wa away for a long time . when i got back i looked at it and thought hmm i wonder if it will still be there ? a few minute later it wa on my doorstep . needle to say , it wa one of my new faves . i love this cd . i have a feeling the album will be my new best of for a long time to come ! i have no idea what the cd is called but i am pretty sure it will be on a list of best of 2009 for sure . i guess this is a good time for me to say thanks to the creator of this cd . thanks for being so amazing !
0	dave clark five is another great album from the dave clark five . some of the song are great , others are okay . i like the music .
0	this song wa good

1	the band sound great live . the sound quality is great and the sound of the band is perfect .
1	i listened to this song on my ipod a few time and loved it , but i did not even know they had a cd of the original version of this song .
0	this is one of those nice to have album . well , it is not a very good album , but it is not not a very good album . it is just a good album . the lyric are great and the music is great . if you like some other music , check out the other album .
1	this wa a big hit in the 80 , so it can not be that bad . it is very slow , but it is not slow a molasses by any mean . i like the backing singer and the piano . i also like the drum , but the electric guitar is very weak and the vocal are very bad . i did like the bass , but the bassist is a very poor bass player . the guitar player ha a strong voice , and i like the way he play . but the piano player ha a very weak voice . they also did a cover of ( i have had ) the time of my life .
0	this is a great song however there are too many note and not enough melody in this song . not to mention the constant strumming and tapping . the note are off and you sound like you are trying to sing with only one finger . i have had to stop listening to this song because of this . i would not recommend this song to anyone

1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

1	this song wa amazing . i enjoyed the song very much and the video wa good too .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	this is from the man who sang the boy is mine . the lyric are from his father- he doe not seem to be a very good father . when he finally did come home after a very long time , he came home with a bottle of whiskey and told my husband and i he wa sorry for breaking up with the kid , but he could not stop thinking about them . he wa sorry . we did not drink or take his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long time . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about the kid . we did not drink , but we did not stop his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long while . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about u . we again did not drink or drink his whiskey . he wa a very nice person who we did not want to do harm to . we did not want to do harm to him either .
1	this song would be a great radio song . the video is very nice .

1	very good . the original song is very well done , but the remix is a little different , but i like it .
1	i love this song . i love the sound quality and the lyric are great . the only problem i have is that i have to keep hearing this song over and over again .
1	this is definitely an excellent album . i have listened to this album a lot since i first discovered it . it is one of the best album i have heard in the past few year . i like that the track are very different and have a mix of style . the first track is the lead track , which is very well done . the rest of the track are very well done . i think this album is very well done .
0	i love the song . this is one of her best song . it is very good .
1	this is very relaxing and soothing . i bought this because i wa tired of having to listen to the same song over and over again without really enjoying it . i am very happy with this purchase . it is very relaxing and sound good .

1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i am a huge fan of this artist and this is the first time that i have bought her cd .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this song really rock !
0	i really hope this album come out soon . i love this cd .
1	this song just amazing . i really like this album .
0	i do not like the song , i know the album you are talking about but this song is not my favorite either .
0	this is a cover of a song by a band i have never heard of . it ha nothing to do with the lyric and is not at all a good song .
0	i received the cd in a good case . the cd wa in a good case , but the case wa cracked . i will be returning this cd in a good case . the cd is clear and in a good case . i would recommend anyone to get the cd in a case and not crack it .

1	this album can be found on the itunes store for $ 7.99 for the standard version or $ 13.99 for the deluxe version . the song on here are great to listen to . i have tried to find other song online but can not find them . this is a great album that will keep you entertained for a long time .
1	this is the best trance album ever . i love it .
1	i like it when i hear a song that is a good song .
1	i love jazz ! i love tom scott music and i have been waiting for this cd for a very long time . i have listened to him for year and year . i am very happy .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i love the new version of pistol annies . i am not a big country music aficionado . but this song fit right in . i feel like this song really speaks for itself .
0	i like the song , but the vocal is a little bit off
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i love the beatles . i have been listening to this album for a long time now . i love that it is the only album i have ever owned in stereo . i am a big fan of johnny cash and the music of johnny cash . i also like willie nelson and john williams . i am a big fan of the music of john williams . i have been listening to this album for a long while and really like it . i wish there were more album by john williams . my favorite artist are willie nelson , john williams , johnny cash , and the beatles . i also like the music by the beatles , john williams , and willie nelson .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is an excellent album for a dance party . the energy is great , the energy is high . i love how the track are so different and all have their own character . the vocal are very powerful and have great energy to them . this album is full of surprise , but it is one you will never forget .
0	this is my favorite cd by reo speedwagon . i think they are the best rock & roll band in the world . i used to listen to them when i wa in high school .
0	if you can get past the song being all over the place and the overdubs on the guitar and vocal , this is a good album .
0	this album reminds me a lot of the godfather .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i bought this new cd just to have a listen to it . i have been listening to the pretender record since i wa 11-16 , but this album ha a totally different sound , and i did not know that this wa the pretender that bonnie had been working on . i like the old song on this album , but i do not know if i can take listening to this album anymore .
1	this is the first cd i have ever bought from cdnow , and i am disappointed in the song selection . i have never heard the song that were on this cd . i am not expecting anything , but i would at least have a better song selection than this cd ha .
0	good album . good price . if i wa a young man , i would purchase this . it is good . i would not buy it for my daughter . i agree about the length of the cd . i would not buy it for my daughter . i would not buy it for a young man . it is good . i would not buy it for my family . i would not buy it for a young man .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i love it ! i am always on the lookout for relaxing and calming music .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i think i love this song .
1	my son loved this song .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

0	i first had this cd in the mail , and i loved it , it gave me new thing to think about . i would definitely recommend this cd .
1	i have not listened to music like this in a very long time . i have been listening to the beautiful life cd and i am enjoying it . i am very impressed with this artist and the music on this album is fantastic .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	this is the best cd i have ever listened to . i have been waiting for it for a very long time now . i can not wait to get this cd .
0	this album reminds me of the smashing pumpkin .
0	this wa a good choice for me . i liked it .

0	i love his music ! but this album is just boring .
1	i bought this album because i thought it would be a good time to listen to some 80 music . i wa not disappointed . it is a good album .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this album is good , but it is not a good a the first . the song are good , but the band is not a good a the first . it is not a bad album , but i feel that the band ha improved since then .
0	a little of keith sweat like . you do recollect him , but there is nothing in this tape to remind you . it had no music worth mentioning .
1	i love this album !
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i have to say that the cd is good , but the song are terrible . i do not understand this style of music . i do not want to listen to the same song over and over again . i want to listen to a different song each time i listen to it . i understand that this is the style of music that people like , but i think it is bad for people who like to listen to a specific style of music .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	this is the best e.s . posthumus cd i have ever heard . s.r .
1	this is a great song . the music is very nice and the voice is very good . the lyric are very good , too . i think this cd ha a lot of potential .
1	this is a great song . not only is it a great song but , it is a great way to end an album . i can sing it . now i can look up word that i have never heard before . barbra streisand , will always be a great singer .
1	i love
0	it is not really a song . it is a video . this song and video are great and cute but it is not a song . it is a video , because that is what miley is famous for , but she is not really an artist . she is just someone who is famous for being famous .
0	i love this song , but i have to agree with the other reviewer . the lyric are offensive to woman , and this is a song that is supposed to be about woman .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this song is a great song . i love this song . i am always singing it in the shower .
0	the best in the broadway era . i am a big fan of this album , i used to have it in my collection . i really like it and so doe my wife , we are both fan of the show , well actually my wife is a huge fan of the show . the song are decent , but they are not all that great .
0	very weak . the band is not a very good live band , the sound seems very muddy , and there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too weak to make it sound great .
0	lareiner is an awful song .
1	i bought this album for my wife . it is everything i wanted . it is perfect for me .
0	i am going to make an album of my favorite song . i want to make it so that whoever listens to it think that is what they heard . i want to give them a different interpretation of the song than they heard from the original .

1	i love the band . they are great .
1	a tom scott album that is more pop than rock , but ha a lot of great song , and some really good riff and melody . the album is a bit on the slow side , but i do not think it is for everyone . i think the album is a little too long and the song are a bit repetitive . this is a really enjoyable album for people who like to have fun .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i like the first song a lot , but the last song is too fast for her style .
0	i love this album , but when i first started listening to it , i had to put it down because it wa so loud . i started listening again , and i could not put it down because i just love the song . i would buy it , but i do not know why if i ever want to listen to it . i do not think the album is bad , but i just do not know .
0	this album reminded me of the smashing pumpkin . the music wa good , and the lyric were cool . the only song i did not like wa love you baby , but the rest of the song were good . this album is the best album i have heard in a long time .
1	i find this so annoying . i thought the music wa good and now i have to listen to a documentary of the band playing the song , one i have never heard before . they were playing a song i did not get through the night , and now they are doing a new version of song i have heard before and have forgotten about . i am angry and disgusted , and i will have to say something .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i wa so happy to find this song on my cd player . i love the lyric & the music . i just bought the cd today .

1	this album is great , i am impressed by this album . i wa a bit disappointed with the quality of some of the song ,
0	hey , this is a very interesting song .
0	rk ha been around and in the business for a long time now . he is not going to stop making record because he is not a good a some of the other big name artist . he is not going to stop making record because he is r.kelly . he is going to continue making record because he is rk . he is going to continue making record because he is the rk of r & b . he is going to continue making record because he is the r of r & b .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i am going to give this album a 5 star rating because i really like it . the song on this album are
1	i have been a fan of this band for a long time . this album is a classic .
0	the song is okay , i guess . not bad . no real standout , however . i think this is an okay song . it ha a good beat . the lyric are ok. i do not think they were written just for the purpose of the video . they are about life and death and stuff . the video is pretty simple . the only thing that really stand out is the lighting . it look really bad . i do not like it one bit . the song itself is okay . i think . it is sort of average , but that is about it . i do not know . i do not know . it is not bad . i do not really know what to say about this song . it is okay , but it doe not have any real stand out feature . it is not good . i do not know what to say about it . i guess it is a decent song anyway . but it is pretty plain . i guess . i do not really know . i do not know . i just do not like it . it is not good .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	if you like country music , do not listen to this album , you would not like it if you like country music . i think this band would make a better hard rock band , not country music , and in my opinion , this band is not country music .
1	i like this cd , but i had to get an mp3 version because the cover wa so beautiful . i would still recommend it though . it is very relaxing and nice . i really like the dave clark five . this is the only cd i bought before itunes . i wa really impressed at how easy it wa to download it onto the iphone .
1	this compilation is a great collection of musical recording of the late 1950s . it is an easy to find compilation and is a great compilation . the song are mostly of the late 1950s and the style of music are all great . this compilation is a real treat to listen to . this album ha a real nice feel to it . i like this compilation of late 1950s music . i love this compilation of the music of the late 1950s .
0	very weak recording . the band is not a very good live band , the sound appears very murky , and there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too light to make it sound great .
0	a very good song , but the last 3 song are a waste of time .
0	this is a collection of rare , hard to find , and previously unrecorded song from the early year of bonnie raitt . it is a collection of song from the mid to late 70 that have never been released on any of her album . this is an amazing album . all of the song are great . i really love the song all alone with something to say and the song how much is enough . most of the song have an energy that is so hard to find in today music . it is just a great mix of old and new song . the sound quality is also nice on this album . if you like bonnie and want to hear some of her classic , this is definately recommended .
1	this song is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . this is a good choice . this is a good choice . i like this song . i like this song . it is a good choice . it is a good choice i like this song . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is good . it is a good choice . this is a good choice
0	i like this song but it wa just ok .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i love her music . this is an excellent mariah album .
0	this album is just okay . i have heard that people are just not that into this band and that it is because of their sound . to me , it is because of the lack of musical diversity . they have a lot of good song but it is just not diverse enough to make the album interesting . this is the only cd i have ever really disliked by the dave clark five .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	it reminds me of the way i have always loved to sing . i love the way the music and the lyric flow together .
1	this is an excellent song , and very well performed . the lyric are just what i wa looking for . a i wa listening to it , i thought of some of the thing i had been through in the last three year .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .

0	very good cd for the price . some of the song are a bit short but most of the song are good
1	tom wait is not here . the band ha a great stage presence , and they sounded great . the sound quality wa decent and the music wa good .
1	i would like to recommend this to anyone who like pop music . it had a great story and very memorable music .
1	i wish they had made this album in a more traditional way . it is the best beatles album , in my opinion . i can not think of a single bad song on here ( unless i am forgetting one ) and it is a very easy listen to . and although they were not the best beatles , i know that they were at the top of their game .
1	i like this song . the music is very nice and the lyric are also nice .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i listened to this song a lot a a teenager . i think it is a good song .
0	i am a huge fan of her music . it is very refreshing . i have purchased several of her other cd and i have enjoyed them all . i have been married for over 10 year and this cd ha helped to help me through many of the bad day we have had in recent year .

1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	what is the deal with this guy ? i have listened to this cd a few time , and i am getting sick of it . the song are good , but not great . i do not understand why he doe what he doe . the song are great , but it is the production that make me sick .
0	it is one of the most popular song . it is one that everyone know . it is also one that is often played on the radio . it is a very positive song . it is a lot of fun to listen to it .
0	larein is a good song . it is not a very good song though .
0	i like it , but i wonder where this version can be found .
0	this cd wa very nice . i have to agree with the other reviewer , it is just a tad repetative .
0	i have been a fan of lareine since the day i first heard them . their music is extremely well produced and their instrumentation is top notch . i own all of their album and i am a huge fan of electronic music .
1	the album is very well performed and the music is great . tom scott is a great jazz musician .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this app is just awesome and i love reading to my child .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	great music . i have all of the ode to joy on cd , and i will be buying more .
1	i wa disappointed when i listened to this album . i got the cd because it wa a gift from my mom .
1	i love this cd . it help me to relax .
1	i love the story line of this song . i wa in a car accident . i wasnt supposed to talk about it . instead , i talk about the pain i felt . the song express my pain so well . it is a slow song . you need to slow it down . it is not a song that will get you down . this song is so beautiful . there are not a lot of song like it .
1	my husband bought this for me for christmas . i wa happy to receive this song .
0	i love the lyric , but the way she sings them is all wrong . kind of off key . she sings a little high , and a little low . she also sings over the line a lot . this album is good for what it is , but i do not think it will stand out much in the cd world .
0	i really love barbra , i have been listening to her for about 15 year . i really feel like it is been a very long time since i wa listening to her . i have never liked her more than i do now . i have been thinking about getting the album greatest hit she did , just to see what the song are like . i wa always a fan of her , and this is a great album . i do not like her voice at all , but i like it .
1	if you really want to know what the most powerful , awesome , emotional , and amazing album ever is then listen to this album . the lyric are so powerful and touching . the music is so powerful . the music is so powerful . the music is so powerful . the lyric are so powerful and touching . the lyric are so powerful and touching . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the song are so emotionally packed and so powerful . the song are so emotionally packed and so powerful . the song is so powerful . the song is so powerful . the song is so powerful and so emotionally packed and so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful and so emotionally packed and so powerful . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so strong and so emotional . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the word are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so powerful . the word are so powerful . the word are so powerful . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so strong . the word are so powerful . the word are so powerful . the word are so strong . the word are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the music is so powerful . the music is so powerful and so emotional . the lyric are so powerful . the music is so powerful . the album is a masterpiece . the album is a masterpiece . the album is a masterpiece . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the music is so emotional . the music is so emotional . the music is so powerful . the music is so powerful . the album is a masterpiece and also very emotional . the music is a masterpiece . the album is a masterpiece . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so strong . the music is so emotional . the lyric are so strong . the lyric are so powerful . the music is so emotional . the lyric are so powerful . the music is so powerful and also very emotional . the music is a masterpiece . the music is a masterpiece . the lyric are strong . the lyric are strong . the music is so emotional . the lyric are so powerful . the lyric are so powerful . the album is a masterpiece . the album is a masterpiece and so emotional . the music is a masterpiece . the album is a masterpiece .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i love this album , but it is so bad you can not even call it an album . it is like listening to a radio station that ha multiple song playing at the same time . it is no better than listening on a tape player . i would give this record a 4.5 but the song are so boring that i do not know how i would get through this record .
1	the album is great , i do not understand why someone would put out an album like that , it is not music , it is a bunch of nice tune that are easily listened to . i am having a hard time listening to it , i do not like it . i like the tune but it is like you put out an album that is too nice for you to listen to the rest of the world . i like the song but i do not listen to the album and i do not buy it . i do not like it . it is a really nice song , great lyric , a fine guitar playing , but i do not like it . it is a nice tune and it is a very good tune and it is a very wonderful tune , so
0	this cd play for only a few second and then pause and start over . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i liked the first three song , but the last two just missed my ear . i wa hoping for a more epic song here and i wa hoping for something more of a rockabilly sound . i thought this wa a nice throwback to their earlier work , but i do not think they are a polished or polished enough to make me want to buy the album .
0	i have pre-ordered this cd but i had to return it for a reason that i will not say out loud . i could not get my hand on it once it wa released . i will not be ordering any more of mileys cd unless this is fixed . i am a huge fan of her too .
1	i love prince . i got this cd for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it .
0	i bought this album on the recommendation of a friend . i think this album is better than the singer previous album , but not by much .
0	wow ! it is a beautiful recording .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	i just wanted to let you know that i enjoyed the song and i liked the song . it is been a great tune to play on my car stereo . i would recommend this to anyone . i would like to buy it , but i could not afford it . i have to get back to you on that one . i hope you do not mind me asking , but wa the song written by someone or wa it written for someone ?
1	this is such a beautiful song . i feel like i should be able to sing it .
0	this is a great album . i like it . i like the song praise god , beautiful , and amazing . i do not like the song amazing . i do not like praise god . i do not like beautiful . i do not like holy spirit and amazing . the best song on this cd are the song praise god , beautiful , amazing , and praise .
0	she sings very well .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i have had my lg g2 for about a month now and i am very impressed with it . the battery last all day and the screen is very bright , so i can do most thing on it outside of direct sunlight . i can not say that about iphone or anything else . i have not had my htc incredible . i love my g2 . i love how the screen is backlit and the key are backlit . i love how the key have a nice click to them . i love that the screen is backlit and not just a very dark screen . i love the keyboard , and the voice command in both direction work very well . the speaker is loud and clear , and it ha a clear microphone and a good microphone . the button are large and i love the battery life . the phone is very light and easy to hold and it feel very solid .

0	this is a boring song and the lyric are terrible . this is the worst song ever . the only redeeming thing about this is that it ha a great beat . it sound like a beat from a rap song . it is the worst song i have ever heard . the only redeeming thing about this is that i wa able to keep track of the time . it wa like 4:00 am or something . i wish i could have stayed awake until 6:00 am to listen to it . i wish i could have stayed awake just to listen to it . it wa a good song , but it is not worth the money .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .

0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i like this song . i think it is about a guy who is lazy . he doe not want to do anything . he is a real downer . he make it more challenging for everyone around him . it is a great song to listen to when you want to get out of your way .
0	it is a good album , but not extraordinary . it is definitely a nice album . i will give it one star , but it is not a best album of the year award .

0	i like the movie version too much . i can not find this version on the cd of the movie .
1	this wa a big disappointment for me , but not that bad . this is a great record , but it is too long . this is the first time i have ever been able to listen to a cd at the same time , then put it back together and listen to it again . you have to be patient with this album .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	these two recording are not only wonderful , but they are also very well recorded . the sound quality is excellent , and everything is balanced and loud enough to be enjoyable . these are not live recording , though . they are both recorded just after a performance , so they are both very long ( 1:06:38 ) . they also both feature the orchestra of the first symphony , which is an excellent group .
1	i would like to say that i have been a fan of mr tom wait for some time , and this album ha turned me into one again . i love it ! this is my favorite album by wait . and for the first time , i like a tom wait album that is not a country album . i think this is a great album . and in my opinion , it is the best tom wait album .

1	i like this cd because it is relaxing to listen to .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i love this album . i love the original song . the band itself is very tight and the vocal are very good . i do not like the song that seem to be played over and over again . i am not sure what the problem is because i have always loved keith and he is always one of my favorite singer .
0	the first song is great , but the last song is too fast .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i love this is for the people who tell me i can not do anything & that i will never be successful this is one of my favorite song , i just listened to it for the first time in a while and i just want to say thank you for giving me this perfect song . it really is just perfect .
0	i first heard this band when i saw them live in my hometown . they were great . i have heard about them from friend , but i had never heard them . i wa very excited when they released the first album . i am glad i waited and bought their second album . it is a very good album . i really like the album . i would recommend it to people that are interested in the style of music they play .

1	this is my first mariah cd . after hearing the first cd , beautiful , i wa not looking for another mariah cd . i have been a mariah fan since i heard her first cd . when i found this cd , i wa really excited and tried to find the other mariah cd . i finally found them and this is my third mariah cd . i have had this cd for about 2 day and i am already listening to it . this is a very good mariah cd . i am looking forward to the next mariah cd .

1	this is a great album that i love . there is so much going on throughout the entire album . there is a lot of energy in the music and it feel like a lot of love is being put into every track . i love that there is so much diversity in this album . i also do not mind the different instrumentation . i really enjoy the more old school sound . i love that it is not all smooth and laid back . it is very very diverse and i love that this is the only album i have ever heard that is a mix of everything . i like it a lot .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i can not believe i did not know about this song ! it is really great !
1	this song just make me want to go to heaven to listen to it again . it is a good song , but not the best .
1	i bought the album , and it wa exactly what i expected . the song are very good and the voice are great .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	this is a great show ! i have seen it 3 time and i love it . i can not wait to see it again .
0	i have been a fan of kelly clarkson for year . i have bought her album and single and have always been pretty happy with them . however , i wanted to see how she could do when she recorded on her own . this is not kelly clarkson , not at all .
0	this song . it is good but the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is inconguous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker , and this is far from rock . i am not a big fan of this kind of song .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	lorde is one of the most beautiful human being i have ever heard . this is a beautiful song . it is just a great song . i think i will listen to it every day and i want to make this song a part of my life .

0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	it is a shame that the cd is not a good a the original lp , and the original lp wa released in 1980. the version of rock on is not the original recording . there is no way to tell if the version on the cd is the original version or a studio version . what i can say without a doubt is that this is one of the best album out there . the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1981 or 1982. this cd wa released in 1981 , so you had to get it in 1982. the song are a good a any other dave clark five album , but the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1982 .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i think her singing is very good ; the only thing i do not like is the fact that you can not hear the lyric while the song is playing .
1	i am a fan of this band . the lead singer ha a fine voice and play a mean guitar . and this cd is great .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i really love the dave clark five . i wa a fan since heart of stone . i love jewel music . i hope they release more of their cd . i bought their first cd , tiger moon and then i bought a few more of their cd , but have never purchased a cd from them . i hope to get a cd from them sometime soon .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	a friend recommended this album to me . it is not my favorite , but the guitar playing is really great and i like the whole sound-very laid back and smooth . i can not really imagine how one person can do a good a this album . i love
0	this is the second jewel cd i have bought . i have bought every dave clark five album i could find , and i have always liked the music . i think it is one of the best of the 1980s , in my opinion .
1	this is the first time i have written an amazon review with a negative sentiment . just had to vent : ) i think it is a great album and i have listened to several of the song a few time now . the song are catchy and the album overall is well structured . the album doe have an r. and b vibe that i enjoy , but i would rather hear a straight up r & b album than this one .
0	i like the song , but the lyric are too long .
1	this song ha very good message and really ha a lot of song that you can sing along to .
0	this disc is so generic . it wa more of a rock cd . i do not know what it is called , but it wa really generic . i do not know why i bought this disc . i like the song , the greatest show on earth . i do not know how it came up , but i have it in my collection .
0	this is my song that i play when i am having trouble with my relationship .
0	i wa a fan of this singer and her song . i did not think the record would be a good a it turned out to be .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	this album is a beautiful album .
0	i love my wife and she ha a love for this song . it is always on in the house even when she is not singing it . it is just something that she will sing along with for day . i do not know if i would have ever heard this song in a commercial that i thought wa catchy . it is just a wonderful song and i feel like it missing from the radio at the moment .
0	this is my first album of the reo speedwagon so i really had no idea what to expect before i picked it up . it is a great album .
1	this is a good country
0	this song is the best version of this song i have heard . i like what it lack in instrumentation and vocal .
1	i think
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	this is the best of the best of album . it doe not include any of the best of album . it is the best in the studio version of the album . the problem with the album is the song are too similar . i liked the band , but it doe not have a good enough song structure to be a contender for best of . i also found a few annoying melody in the song .
0	if your looking for a good song , this is not it . if you want an album of great song , buy it .
1	i like the theme for this show . it is a good song , but i think it might have been better for some reason , i do not know why they chose this song to be the theme for this show .
0	the song is a powerful song about the triumph of faith . the lyric are a little long for a 7 minute song , but it is a good song for the christian , who longs for god to be his strength and guide .
0	this album sound like a bunch of diva , who is trying to imitate barbra streisand .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a few month now and just can not get into it . i have listened to it for quite some time and i still can not get into it . i do like the song my friend , loving you , and just like i love you . i have not played any of these song in a long time , but i can still remember them and the original version of the song wedding day is awesome .

1	this is an amazing album . the song are great and at the same time very different . one song is really good and another song is really bad . i think this album deserves a positive review , even though it is so different from anything i have ever heard before . it is a hard album to describe but it is amazing .
0	the sound quality is horrible . the only thing that made it good wa the fact that it sounded like it had been recorded in a basement , not in any studio , which make it much easier to review . the whole thing wa an experiment to see if you could record a band live and sound it back on tape . it worked , but the sound quality wa awful . i found that when i turned the volume up , it sounded like i wa in a basement . and there were only three or four song on the tape . but i did hear some good stuff . not worth listening to , but interesting .
1	the beatles are my favorite band . when i first heard the beatles in 1977 , i wa instantly enthralled . i still have all of their album , and i am still a fan .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i downloaded the cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like using the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i would not recommend this cd .

1	i love this cd . i am a fan ! i will add it to my collection .
1	i do not think i have ever heard a song that can compare to the i do not know by james taylor . this song is powerful and it definitely set the tone for the album .

1	tom scott-the unheard is a great album . i love the arrangement .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this album is great . but , there is a problem with the packaging . there is a problem with the disc . i got the first copy of the album i could find , but when i listened to the second copy , the disc wa not the same . i wa very disappointed with it , so i had to throw it out .

1	this album ha a lot to offer . i have listened to so many gospel album over the past few year ( to the point where i have literally lost count ) that i have been thinking about putting together a little gospel cd . i have listened to this album over and over again , and i have to say that i like a lot of the song on here . i like the album cover , and i like the song i love you . i also like the album , and i can see why this album wa put out . it ha a lot of positive thing to offer .
0	the first time i heard this song i wa driving and the sound wa so peaceful .
0	i love all the grateful dead cd . i have never had a bad live performance in my life , and i am quite familiar with the dead . the only thing i have not been able to do so far is to buy all the live cd , which are very expensive . i think this is a good selection of dead song , but i would like to know if there is a way to buy the live cd at a lower price .
1	i love this singer , she is amazing ! i think i have watched her live about 10 time and i just love her . i know she doe not have a lot of hit but i love her music and i hope it is all she ha .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i love the grateful dead and i am a big fan of the music , but this cd is terrible . the music is very repetitive and boring . i will not be buying any more grateful dead cd .
1	this is the best album i have listened to this year
1	i love this song . i listen to this song so much . this is one
0	i love every song on this cd . i love to listen to it and see the different people singing .
0	there are some good track here , but also some very bad track , the song i hated were fantastic and wake me up
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i wa looking for a good album for my daughter . this album is great . she can sing the song very well . i really like her music .
0	i have never liked any of reo speedwagons song . i am sure they are good , but i do not like them . i like most of the other song on their album . walk this way wa the only song i liked .
0	this song wa awesome .
1	i love this album ! i do not know much about this band , but the music is great . i like the vocal on the song and the melody on the song . this album is great !
0	i am disappointed that this cd ha no music credit . i wa hoping for a song with a melody or something like that .
0	i like the album . i like the songwriting on the album . it is very good . i do not like the song , and the album sound much better without it . and , at least it is a decent album . but , i do not understand why someone would put this song on a compilation album with the others . it is a terrible song . i like a lot of the other song on the album , but not this song . i will listen to this song again , but not on a compilation album .
0	i love the album .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i love the first song she wrote . i really like this version , too . she is not the first to cover a song , but she is the first to attempt to write a song that is a good a the original .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i like the dave clark five . i do not know if they are good or not , but i like all of their song . they have some great song .
0	awol nation is a really fun song with a lot going . it is super short . the chorus is kind of annoying .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i like the song and the video . the song ha a positive message that most people do not want to hear .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	this song is a great song . the vocal are great . it is a great song . it is an awesome song . but i just do not like the lyric . i do not really like the song .
0	so i recently bought this album and started listening to it and it is one of the best album out there . i wa at a loss for word a i wa so excited to hear this album . it is definitely worth a listen . i recommend this album to all my friend . it make me feel good to listen to and make me forget all my trouble . thank you for this album . you are awesome .
0	this album is not good . it is repetitive and it doe not flow well . there are some great song , but it is not a good album .
0	the song i got you is a pretty good song . i like the vocal arrangement of the song , though it is not a good a the other song on this album . it is a 3 star song .
1	i like it . it sound good .
0	lareine is a really good song .
0	i like the song the glory of god and the song unleashed very much . i am not a fan of the song amen the song i will not like is the song praise is what i do the song is not great . i do not know why ponder wrote this song . it doe not have a great message or even a good message . the song is just a bad song .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i bought this album for my brother and he said that it is the best trance i have ever heard . i am glad he like it and i hope he will buy the next album , which i have yet to find out if they have one or not .
0	a good cover . it is ok , not great . the lyric are ok , not great .
0	great music , but i am not sure if it is an album . there are no song in the guy point of view . it is more like a collection of song from the grateful dead .
0	do not know . i like the music and the video . i like all of the music and all of the video .
1	i am a huge prince fan . i just could not get into this album . it is a prince album . the beat are great , and the vocal are great . it just doe not sound like prince .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i love this song ! i think it is one of the best song written in the past few year . i think lareine ha many more song like this . i do not care if it is not a hit or not ( because it is good ) i love it !
0	if you like the dave clark five , you are going to love this . it is a collection of their song , with a few added instrumentals by paul humphreys . the song are a good a anything out of the eighty . it is just a if they are playing in the early eighty . the only thing i will say is that it is not a good a the original lineup album , but that is what i wanted after listening to this album .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	wow , this is a little odd . i ordered this cd yesterday , and it wa shipped today . all look good , just a couple of track and the artwork . i can not really tell what it is . there is no track list or anything - i am guessing that it is some sort of electronic demo . i am not even sure if it is a cd or a dvd .
1	i like the song and the album but i am not really sure what to think about it . i like the vocal but i do not know .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	i really liked this song !
1	great album ! the first two song are excellent . the vocal are good but the sound of the instrument is not a good a the first two song . i like the first song but do not care for the
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i wa very saddened by the death of mary margaret ohara . i had known mary for many year , and wa saddened by her death . i will never forget her . after i finished listening to this album , i realized that i would never hear her voice again . i wa very sad . i will miss her voice .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	love you so wa the one song that wa on my to be added to my cd . so i purchased the cd with that song on it . i have been waiting for the next one !
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this is the best collection of ansermeets recording i have ever heard . it is a must have for any fan of ansermet or classical music in general .

1	i have purchased four of the five song on this app and i will be buying more .
0	i liked the first disc , and i liked the second disc , and i liked the cover . i liked the fact that it wa a cd of music and not a bible . the cover wa good . the cover wa good . i liked the fact that it wa a cd of music and did not have picture on the cover like some of his cd . i liked the fact that it wa a cd of music and had no picture on the cover like some of his cd .
0	i have always loved the song my baby just a much a i have always loved whitney houston . it is a perfect song to end your day and just be happy that you are not the only one who ha a baby . i do not know about whitney , but to me whitney voice is just a good a barbra streisand . this is an amazing song and i am glad i have not listened to it too many time .
0	this is my favorite album by the dave clark five . i am a huge fan of the dave clark five and their album . i love the music and all of their album . this is the best album by them . i like it a lot . i highly recommend this album .
1	this is definitely not a bad album at all . i have listened to most of his album and this is the only one that i had never heard before . i wa very impressed . i did not like the fact that the song were not very well put together , but that wa not the reason i did not like the album . i did not enjoy the vocal . if you are not used to the old music and the vocal are not that high , you may find this album a little boring . that is not to say i did not like the album . i actually really liked it . i think the only reason i did not like it wa that i did not like the vocal . i thought they were too high in some of the song . the rest wa good . i would like to give this album one star because i would like to listen to it again and i would like to see if i will like it or not .
0	it wa the most annoying song on the entire playlist , but still a good song and i do not like any of the song on the playlist

0	i love this band and i think they are really talented . but this cover is a little too boring . the color of the cover are great , but they are not used to good effect . the background is a little too white with the wrong sound .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	david lee roth doe not write very well , but he ha one of the most powerful voice of any musician in the world . so what make this album a hit ? that is the name of the song . you can not escape me is a classic david lee roth song . it is a ballad , a love song , a rock song , and a very powerful song . it is one of those song that have a message in the lyric , or on the music . the lyric are very empowering , and the music is very powerful . it is a great song .

1	i like lareiner a lot . it is a good song .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

0	i do not care what anyone say , this album is not worth the $ 14.99 . bonnie is one the best singer but this album is a waste of time . even the song she sings are terrible . i do not understand how anyone would listen to this album . bonnie and the pretender are much better .

1	i love the dave clark five . i think this album is a great record . i love the album cover too . some song are too long , though .
0	this is a great song and i am glad i bought it . but it is quite a long song and you have to be patient with the lyric . and that is a bit of a drag . but once you get through it , it is a great song .
1	this is for you . the word are in spanish , so i thought it wa for the woman watching the show . i like the lyric and the message .
0	i think this is a great song . i love the music , but the lyric are not that good , so i would not recommend this to anyone .
1	this is a very good album . some of the song are very good , and some are pretty good . the album is a very well put together work , i wish i could say more about it but i do not have anything to say .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i really like this song . i will play it when i drive . it is a very good song .

0	i wa very surprised with this song , and it wa the only song i could not get into and wa so amazing . i highly recommend this song .
1	i am not sure why i am reviewing this . i have heard a couple of review , where people have said that the guitar is not loud enough . i think that the sound is good . i have played this cd around a bit and i am really enjoying it . i have two cat , so i may have to buy some extra headphone . i think that i like this very much . i wish i had it from the beginning . i am just not sure why they did not add more song to the cd . i think that they should have just added one or two more song .
1	the best christmas album i have ever heard . from beginning to end , this album is amazing . i bought this album a a gift for my little sister and she loved it . she even made me an album of her favorite christmas song . i will always be thankful to my sister .
1	this cd is a must-have for any music lover . a pleasant listen .
1	i love this album !
0	i like the song but some of the vocal do not really match the rest of the song . i do not know why i like this song . this song wa not very good . i do not like the recording . i do not know why i like the song . i do not know what the song is about . i just like the song .
1	a great song from the 70 , this song sound like it wa recorded in a studio with lot of echo and reverb , but still sound like the song wa recorded live . it ha a very catchy chorus , but i have a feeling that it is not too original . it sound like the song wa recorded by david cassidy . enjoy .
1	this is really , really pretty ! the original version is not that great . i may even buy both version !
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i have never liked rap music , but i like this cd and i think it is great . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	wake me up before you go-go is a great song . it is catchy and ha a great melody , but doe not do anything to stand out from other song in the album .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i use the laptop everyday to write and draw and i love my window phone
1	this song is beautiful . i like it .
1	i love this song , and i hope this song is a big hit for the song . this is a great song . listen to it !
1	this is actually a music video . it ha been out for year but i just found out that they are releasing a dvd with the sound of the movie . i wish i had known earlier . it is worth watching . the movie is very well made . i have seen several other music video recently and they are all very well made . the video is not only a music video , it ha a storyline and is a good movie . it ha a beautiful soundtrack .
0	an odd sounding album . i like jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is not what i expected or hoped for .
0	i like this song . it is a great addition to my playlist . she make me smile .
1	i think this is one of the best dave clarkfive album .
1	i have to say that this is one of his better album . i would say it is one of his best .
1	i love miley cyrus and her song . this is a good song . the song is great !
1	this recording is nothing short of a miracle . the performance is simply beautiful . it is a perfect example of how a pianist can communicate so much in his music that just by listening to it you really know how he feel .
0	i like this album , but i do not think it is the best album of all time .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	this song is great , i do not have a problem with it . i love the way the song is structured with the chorus . it is a little bit different from a lot of the other song i have heard , but i really like it . a far a the music , it is good and i really enjoy it . i also love the way the word are sung . it is a very different style to the other song i listen to .
0	i have always been a fan of this song from the movie the notebook . i love it and i like it a lot ! i downloaded it to my phone and it is still not fully downloaded . it wa a waste of my money .
0	this song used to be one of my favorite , but now it is one of my least favorite . i can not stand the word , but i still love the music .
1	this is a great album . the vocal are beautiful and i love the instrumentals . the instrumentals are very beautiful and the vocal are beautiful . i love the track i wish i wa and the track a house on fire . i would say that this album ha a good message , but it is not something that you will sing and dance to every time you hear it . there are a few track that are repetitive , but the track are very different and that is what i like about it .
0	i first heard marie osmond on an episode of the cma award and i had to get her cd . i wa surprised to find no harmony on any of the song , but the voice are so strong and unique .
0	a nice song . it is actually a pretty catchy song , but not the kind that could take a walk on the wild side , like the way you look tonight or frozen . it is nice to hear a song that is not a ballad .
1	this song is the best song on the album . i like e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time !
0	i enjoy the fact that the song is still catchy . i usually like to hear a song that ha some sort of theme or message that can be used in different situation . this song ha that . i like the simplicity of the song , and i love the fact that the song doe not try to be all over the place . it is very easy to remember . i like the fact that it is a song that will keep me going through a rainy day . i guess it is more of a rainy day anthem than anything else , though . i like the harmony in this song . i like the use of different instrument . i am a big fan of the guitar and the drum . i even liked the bass and the snare drum , a they were nice and lively . i would not expect all of the instrument in the song to be there in the original recording , but i like the fact that they are . i would like to see this song performed live in a bigger way . i would like to see the band play this song with some more energy . it is a song i would like to see live , but it is not a good live band that i want to see play this song .
1	i grew up with this great classic song . it is one of those song that you can hear on the radio and never be able to forget it . my cousin who also grew up with this song introduced me to it . it wa one of the first song i knew that wa about jesus . i have actually had it in my car ever since . i love this song because it ha a great message and a simple yet catchy melody , and it is just a great song to listen to . i really wish it wa on more cd .
1	i love this guy . most of the song on the album are absolutely awesome . i can not wait to hear more . i give this album 4 out of 5 star . this is a great album .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this song doe not really have anything special to offer . the song is great but it is just a song . i think .
0	i like this band , and like the song . the song is a little different from the other one on the album . it is just a little bit more mellow , and it is not a catchy a some of the other song . i like the name of the album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i have had this cd for a few month and have listened to it over and over . it is the most atrocious song ever recorded , and it is a shame that people are willing to pay $ 20 for it . i am sorry , but it is the worst cd on the planet .
1	i like this cd . it is a good mix of song . the song you make my heart sing is a good one . i do not know how i can say it like this , but you make my heart sing is my favorite song . i like the other song . overall , i would recommend this cd .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	a long a you do not listen to the opening track , you will be fine . this is a very good album that is just a little on the short side . there were six track that were over ten minute . the first is a good opener and the rest are great . i did like the whole album .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i really like this cd . i like the song no hand very much . i do not know why , but i like bruno mar . i like the song no hand . i think the song no hand is one of the best song bruno mar ha ever written .
0	i really like this album . it is not a bad album , but it ha it own flaw .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	this is the most beautiful christmas album i have heard in a long time . it is so beautiful and tender and yet so full of life . this is a truly beautiful album .
0	this is the third in a series of four cd of the grateful dead playing at the fillmore east in new york city on september 19 , 1965. this concert wa part of what wa billed a the fillmore east band and wa intended to be a benefit for a local childrens hospital . the grateful dead played for nearly two-and-a-half hour and at the end of their set , jerry garcia asked to make a quick phone call to the hospital . a he made the call , he wa joined on the phone by rick wakeman and david grisman . on the phone , the grateful dead leader instructed the two musician on how to play casey jones and the two artist took turn singing the song and playing the guitar while it wa being played . the grateful dead performed another song by the same name before they were joined by the band on their final set of the night .
1	r.kellys voice ha the ability to elevate an album to a whole new level .
1	i love this song , i have it on my ipod . it ha a great intro by the song . the song ha a very good beat . the song ha good lyric and i love the meaning of the song .
1	i have been a fan of this band for a long time . i love the song on this album . i love the music . i love the lyric . i love the production . i think everyone will like this cd . i really like the cd . i buy the cd . i really like the cd . i like this cd . i really like the song . i really like this cd . i really like the song . i like how this cd is produced . i really like the song on this cd . i really like this cd . i really like the song on this cd . i
0	i have to agree . i like this band a lot but this is my second album in three year and i am beginning to not have much interest in the band . this is the first album i purchased from the band website where i wa really interested in the music and wa looking forward to the release . this album is really good but not something i will put on repeat . i love the music , but the new material is just not a good a the old material . so i will give this album a 2.5 but it is not a great album .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	she is a very talented artist . it is hard to believe that she ha only been in this business for a short time .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i love to listen to the cd and when i do , i think the cd cover art is very generic . the song on the cd are good , but i think the cd cover art is not good at all . i would not buy this cd again .
1	this is my favourite cd in the movie .
1	this is a great song . it ha a great beat and it make you want to dance .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is a good version of the song . kind of a good happenstance version .
0	i like love me like a rock ( mp3 file ) , with good sound quality a well . a lot of people will disagree about this one , but i think it is a good song . this song is a little different from the other song on this album , but it is not bad . if you like this song , you will like the rest of the album .
0	this is one of the better song i have ever heard . the lyric are very good . the guitar playing is also good , but the lyric are not . i can not understand the lyric , but i can understand the guitar playing .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this is an amazing song , it truly ha an amazing effect on me . i love it . i hope it get new release .
1	this wa very good .
1	this is the most beautiful song i have heard in a long time on cd . it is probably my favorite song by her , and i love the sound of her voice . i like her voice on this album , but i think it is her voice more than the song . i love her singing on the secret life of walter mitty and i love her singing on rag doll . i liked her voice on you are the one that i want and i like her singing on you are the one that i want - i know , i know - i could be wrong , but i do not think so . this is the only cd that i can say that . i think her voice is her strongest on this album - and on the other song . this is the most beautiful song i have heard in a long time on disc .
0	i have the new lg g2 and love it . i am very happy with it . i am thinking of getting a g2s this year . i will probably get one soon . the battery last all day , and it is definitely a great phone . the keyboard is great for those who like to type a lot . it ha a great screen and the screen doe not get hot .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i think this is a very good song . it is one of my favorite song . i think that you should listen to the whole song .
1	i love this song .
0	a great song i really like the music and the lyric . i really liked the song i am a huge fan of jazz and i like the album i really liked the song it is very well written and i would recommend it i really liked the song it is very good i really like the music and the lyric and i really like the album i did not like the song but i really like the song i really like the music and the lyric and i really like the album i am a huge fan of jazz and i like the album i really liked the song i really like the music and the lyric .
0	gay-trance is a very good album , but i believe that is because i have always believed that the best music in the world is the music of the 60 and 70 ( and not the music of today ) . i have listened to many album of today and they are not nearly a good a the music of the 60 and 70 .
0	this wa a terrible song , boring , stupid , and with no melody . this is a mediocre song . it is a boring song .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i have listened to this album for over a year and i still love it . this is the first cd i ever bought and i am still listening to it . it ha some really great song . i listen to it quite often . it is a good album .
0	this is the first live performance of this group . the band wa probably at the time called the bitter end . this wa recorded in 1986. there are two version of the song . the first is the version i heard on the radio . the second is the version on the cd . if , like me , you are a fan of the band who play the song i will make love to you ( which is on the cd ) then you will probably like this recording . however , if you are not a fan of the band then you might not like it . it ha the same instrumentation a the i will make love to you version , but the bass player is missing . the bass is now played by mark mad dog schatz , who is the third member of this band . this is not a good recording , but it is a good version of the song . it is available for download through the music player on the itunes store .
0	i am a fan of the artist and the music . i did not like the song played this time . it wa just one of the song that were played repeatedly throughout the show . i do not know if it wa because of the song or the fact i wa using itunes on a mac .
1	i love how the song is about being a woman and being a proud black woman .
1	this is an absolutely gorgeous album , a well a a very good song . it is also the first album that i own by the band that i have listened to for every song . i do not think i have ever bought an album by a band that i have listened to every song on . i had to buy this one , because i wanted to hear sweet jane and you do not know me .
0	i can not believe that i have never hear prince r.e.s.p . and it is a real hit !
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	i like this album , but i do not think it is worth the hype .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	this cd is awesome . i think the vocal are good , but the song are not perfect . i love the vocal on this cd . i love the song on this cd . this is a great worship cd . i like the song on this cd . i like the song on this cd . i love the song on this cd . i love the song on this cd . i love the song on the cd . i love the song on this cd . i love this cd . i like the song on this cd . this is the best worship cd i have ever heard and i love it . this is the best worship cd i have ever heard . this is the best worship cd i have ever heard . the lyric are good . i like the vocal on this cd . i love the song on this cd , but i do not like the song on this cd . i love the song on this cd , but they are
0	i love the way he sings with his hand in the air . it is very cool . the only drawback is that it ha a lot of the same tune that you can hear in any number of other recording . there is nothing that i have ever seen that make this album better than any other album i have ever heard .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i liked this song and thought it wa a great song .
0	this is a great album , even with it flaw . the most well-known of these flaw is the inclusion of only two song , the world turned upside down and the night ha a thousand eye , in the set . but the flaw that make this album a bit of a letdown is the selection of the other song is not representative of the others . they are not a good or a varied a the others . however , despite this shortcoming , this album is definitely a worthwhile listen .
0	i have been listening to this album for a couple of day ( i bought it on cd , and i have got a few other vinyl at home too ) . i do not know if i would call it a perfect album , but i do think it is a very good album and would recommend it .
1	one of my favorite album of the year , a i have been a fan of michael hudson since his first album . the album is overall a very well put together cd with great quality .
1	her voice reminds me of judy garland . she is very unique . she ha a great soul .
1	this album is awesome !
0	i love his song , but i really hate the video . the song and the video are one and the same , which i find ridiculous .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	this is my favorite worship song !
0	i bought this cd because i heard a radio interview with member of this band that i really enjoy . i have always liked the music that they do , and i wa really surprised that they decided to make a cd . i am very happy with this cd . the cd is great . the song are really good . although it is a very different sound than their previous work , i enjoy it .
1	i like this song a lot . it is a catchy song and i like the song a lot .
0	this song wa a gift from my daughter . she said it wa beautiful . i love it . i have several version of it on my mp3 player .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	wow ! what a great gift ! it is a wonderful gift for a child . it is very well played , and the song is very well sung . it is so much better than the usual christmas carol you hear . i would not buy it for my daughter . it is a great gift for a child . i would not buy it for my daughter .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i am a big fan of the dead and have been a deadhead for many year . i just want to say that this is a great cd , even though i do not own all the song . it is been a long time since i have listened to any dead music , and i am so glad that i have this cd . this is a great collection of my favorite song .

1	i have not been a fan of jewel album since the first . i am now a fan . i am pretty crazy about her music , and i am so happy to hear her sing again .
1	i love the music of this band , it is so clean and yet there is also a deep bass and dark organ riff that make you feel like you are in a desert . very nice .
1	great song , but doe not deserve the title i gave it . great song , but it is not a rock song like some of the other one on this album . it is a pop song , which doe not go a far a the song on earlier album . the ballad do not compare to the other song on this album . just great .
1	this song is amazing .
1	great collection of song , some of great quality .
1	this is an amazing cd . i really enjoyed it . i could listen to it all day . john
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	it is the same song from the album , but with completely different lyric and i am not sure why the cd is called the journey because it is not really a journey at all , more like a big walk .
0	a fine recording of the great singer . this is a great recording of the man .
0	there is a man in a red suit in this song playing the piano and singing a song about some girl who stole his heart .
1	it is got a great cover , with a killer band name . i do not know if you know these guy , but they are one of my favorite band . they have a lot of great song they wrote for themselves . their song have a very unique sound . they do a lot of cover . they are an incredible band .

1	this album is very good . i love how the song are mixed together rather than being isolated from each other . it seems to make the song a little more cohesive . this album is a very good start to your christmas day .
0	this is an interesting song . i can not really say that i liked this song . i thought i did , but a you can hear i wa wrong . this song is just too fast and too jazzy for my taste . it is not like i can not stand a fast song , but i do not think this song fast . it just doe not flow for me . i am really not a fan of these song that are more of a fast jam than anything . this song is actually a pretty good song , but it is just not my kind of song .
1	it sound great . i am looking for a song to listen to while doing my hair . i listen to the cd player while i am doing my hair . but i have to turn up the volume because it is hard to hear the cd at the volume that i have to listen to it at . i have a laptop with speaker and when i put the cd in the laptop speaker work great . but i have to turn the speaker up a little because they do not have a volume control . but the cd player will not play the cd at the volume that i want it to . i have a sony cd player . i will have to turn it up a little because the volume of the cd is too low . i believe my cd player wa made in the late 1990s . it wa a sony cd player . the cd player will only play up to cd-rw . so that is a problem . i would like to find a song to play at the volume at which the sound is comfortable .
1	the first hammond album i bought . i like it a lot and i hope it hold up half a well a the first time i heard it .
0	this is my first cd , and i am not happy with it . i would give it a 1 because it is my first cd and i think i will have to listen to it a few time to know if i like it or not .
1	i love her music ! her voice is incredible . i have bought her album .
1	this is one of the most amazing musical album ive ever heard . the song are all very well crafted and have a great musical style . the vocal are excellent and it ha a great musical style . the song on this album are very well done and can be enjoyed by everyone .
1	i am sure that every one know that amazon.com is the best place to buy anything . i bought the cd just for the joy of listening to it .
0	i have taken a lot of flak for recommending this album . i really have to . i think it is fantastic . great music , great lyric and good arrangement . also , it is a great album for the fan of the band . i personally , am not a fan of the song , but i still like the band . good music , nice song , good arrangement .
0	the pistol annies version is definitely a cleaner version of the song . this is how i enjoy it when i am out and about .
1	i like it . i think it is great .
1	i love the whole album , but can not get past the title track . love the sound you can get out of this .
0	this is not a great song , but it is a nice cover of a beatles song . i do not think it is a great song . it is just a nice cover of a beatles song , but it is not great . it is not even good .
0	
0	i wa very surprised by this . a good singer and musician . but i do not really think that much of this . i like the cover but there are some thing that are wrong .
0	i bought this album a a gift for my daughter . i do not like the song , heart in motion , the only issue i have with the album is that the song seems to be a feel good song for the average person . i thought that the album would be much more interesting if it had a song that dealt with more of a more negative view of thing . i have been listening to the christian music that i listen to all of my life . it took me a long time to find the music that i love . i used to listen to a lot of christian music , but a i got older , i started to listen to more rock music . i have been listening to a lot of christian rock music , and i really like it . i do not know if i should say it or not , but , i think that the tom scott band is a rock band and not a christian band . a such , i find that i do not like most of their song that are written from a christian point of view . i like the song that they do have song that are written from a christian point of view .
0	i have heard keith on this cd and i love his voice . he is a great singer . he is a great guitar player . he is a great musician , too . the song are all very nice . the only thing i can not stand are the song that are played over and over again . they are very repetitive . i just can not stand that . they have good song , but , they are boring . i mean , these are just song . just like the song on the radio . i mean , they are just song . i like them . they are not bad . i just like them better when they are played on the radio . i like the radio station better ! but , i prefer the song played on the radio better ! the cd is really good . there are a lot of nice song . i like that . there are a lot of good song . that is why i bought this cd . the only bad thing about this cd is the song that are played over and over again . that is it , i just can not stand that . i just do not like that at all . they have good song . they are not bad . i just do not like that they are played over and over again . but , i think that is their problem .
1	this is one of those song that you just have to listen to . it is a great oldie .
0	sam sparro is a nice guy , and his song , like black and gold , are very catchy . he is not a bad singer , he can sing very well , but his voice is not what i would consider to be a powerful voice . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is a great song . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is .
0	this cd is great ! it ha great song ! i would recommend this cd to everyone !
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is also probably one of my favorite song ever . the instrumentation is really good and the vocal are nice . the song is very upbeat and i love the chorus .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i am a sucker for classic album ( i like the beatles , the rolling stone , etc . ) but this is not one of them . the sound quality is excellent ( though they are on vinyl ) . it come with a slipcase and i am glad that it is not bubble wrap . if you are a beatles fan , this is a great collection .
0	i wa looking for a christmas cd for my niece . i went to the store and purchased this cd . i wa expecting a cd with song from the christmas album . i wa not disappointed . the cd is very nice . i listened to the cd in my car and again wa very impressed . the cd is very enjoyable . however , the packaging is so poor that it is driving me nut and making me want to return it . the cd is $ 14.95 . i am so sorry i wasted my money on this cd . i will not be purchasing another cd from them . i am tired of the poor quality of the cd .

0	i like it because it is tom wait . i do not know why i like it .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	there are three disc in this set , with two different version of the same song from each of the album . i would have preferred to have heard the solo recording on one disc .
0	i do not like jazz , but i like this cd . i really liked the song on this cd . the song are not like jazz , but they kind of are .
1	i just started using amazon cd today and i have already purchased a number of album . these are very good looking and quite nice . i am quite impressed with the selection of music available at this site .
0	i am very disappointed that the lyric are so offensive . bob
0	awol nation is a really fun song with a great message . it is super short and the lyric are a little bit annoying . the music video is cute and make me want to dance . i would give this a 3.5/5 .
0	i love this song to death and i have been married to my husband for 20 year . he is also a musician , so we listened to the music . he would always be singing this song . i love this song and i love the lyric .
0	one of the few cover that work . the chorus is quite powerful and the intro is a nice touch . overall , a pretty decent cover .
0	i bought this album when it came out . i have really liked this band and i think they have done some great thing . the band is awesome and i can not wait to see their new album . i do not have any of their older album but i do have most of their newer one . they sound good .
0	my friend bought this for me . and i am now addicted . i love all the lyric , but the best part is when i hear this song in my car driving to and from work .
0	a very good album . i like it a lot .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is a bad album , and it is one of the worst i have ever heard .
1	i have listened to the new jvj album several time . i like the new album better . i have been listening to jvj for about ten day now .

0	i am just a really bad blogger , and i really did not even know of this jazz lp . it wa really nice , and the sound make me want to get my hand on a copy . i only wish i could have bought the whole cd . i love the way this music sound . it make me feel like i am in a small room with a saxophone .
1	what can i say , this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i thought this album wa fantastic . it ha a great story behind it and the vocal on this album are amazing . i will purchase the album for my collection .

0	this is a good song . i like a lot of the stuff he ha done . i do not care for his writing style . i think he is a better singer than writer . i think he is a very nice guy . i feel there would be no harm in buying this cd , but i would not recommend it .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i have to agree with the others , but i really love this cd !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .

0	i am just not happy with this song . i can not understand why people are buying this song . i think it is a waste of money . it is a really bad song . it is not worth the price of the album to me . i do not know why anyone would buy this song . if i had to do it all over again , i would not buy this song .

1	love this song . i love it . i love this song . it is just tooo good . i am sooo glad that it made it onto my list .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this is the first song that i heard by the weeknd . i thought it wa great and the beat is perfect . i love the first line of the song , it is a great song , i hope to hear more from this artist .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this song is not bad . the vocal are good . the guitar work is good . the bass is pretty good . i like
1	music is like a drug .
0	it is not an album . the music is very good . i love the tune in this cd . the song are very nice . i like this cd . it is not the best cd i have purchased though . i do not know if it is because i have a weak memory or what . it is the cd that i used to buy every other year . these are my personal thought .
1	sam sparro is a great singer and musician .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	i just love this version of all alone in the night from the movie maverick starring robert vaughn and gene hackman
0	i will not even listen to this album . it is awful . i have been a fan of david lee roth since he first started his solo career . when he first started his solo career , i wa a fan of him . i have heard him do some good live , but this is the worst thing i have ever heard . i am no fan of him , but i thought this wa a good song . i guess i am not a fan of the music industry . i am not sure why this is here , because it is not very good .
0	the best version of the song i have heard . i like the instrumentation that go along with the vocal .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i have one more sam sparro album to listen to before moving onto something else , so this one i would like to keep . i bought it because i thought it would be interesting to find a sam sparro album with a more contemporary sound . i have listened to this album many time , and i find myself listening to it again and again .
1	i love this song ! i love this song ! it is a beautiful song . it is a song that make me happy . it is a beautiful song .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	the only song i bought from this album is carmen and it is better than the video .
0	my daughter really enjoyed this song . she thought the melody wa nice .
0	this is one of the worst album of the year . lyric are bad . vocal are bad . the production is bad . the song are bad . i am not a fan of this album .
0	i think this is a great song and i love the line about i have been down this road before , but you know i have come out on top .
1	this album came today and i am so happy to have it ! i love it ! this album is amazing and i will never get tired of listening to this album ! this is definitely a trance album that will be around for a long time to come !
1	i bought this album a few year ago and i can not get enough of it ! i love the song on this album . it is very well put together and a very good album .
1	this wa the first band of mine that i truly became a fan of back in the 70 . i wa a big fan of the beatles and the beach boy , but i think the dave clark 5 are the best band i have ever heard .
1	you guy are awesome . i love how you guy take the best song of the 90 and make them into something new . thank you for bringing back great music into a world where it is mostly lost .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i thought mary voice wa always beautiful , but i also thought she wa a great actress . in the past , i have listened to album by several singer in her own right . this cd is so boring , it ha nothing to do with marie osmond , just a bunch of song from previous album . i do not understand how this cd sold so well . why did anyone buy it ?
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this song & video are awesome .
1	this song ha such a great beat . it
1	i love this song .
0	i liked this song , but this is the first time i have heard it . what i did like is that it is a very powerful song , which make me wish for more daft punk type of song to come out .

0	to amazon : this is a very good album i think it is hard to listen to this album in high school , but i can not wait to hear it in college . there are some great song on here and i am glad i got this album . i think this album is better than the last one . thank you for posting this for me .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	this album is amazing . lorde is amazing . i do not think i will sleep tonight because i have listened to this album more than a few time .
0	not a bad album , but i can not find any song i like . i like most of the song that i have heard , but i do not know why i like them . i do not know if it is because of the album or because they are good song that i like .
1	i bought this cd in the hope that there would be some tom wait in the cd . i wa not disappointed.i bought this cd to listen to at a friend house . what i like about tom wait is that he is very versatile . i listen to him a few time a year and when i see him live , i will attend . i love the song that he ha written-they are all beautiful and moving , even the one that are not in this cd . they are all very personal to him-he seems to have written only for himself . i would like to hear more of his song in the future . a cd with song from his other album would be a great gift for a tom wait fan . i found that i liked the cd-it is very well produced.i am not a tom wait fan per se-i am a musician , not a tom wait fan . however i do like his music and enjoy listening to it . what i like about this cd , is the sound quality-it sound great . there is no distortion or noise which is very good . i highly recommend this cd-i have been listening to it everyday for about a month now , and love it and i will continue to listen to it . i like the fact that tom wait ha written quite a few song for himself , and ha been doing it for a long time , and is still able to write . this cd ha a great and personal sound without being watered down or made into some sort of gimmick . i have listened for about a month and am very happy with this cd-it is one of the best i have heard in a long time . i would consider it a must have in any tom wait fan cd collection .
0	i really do not understand the hate that this album get . i like it quite a lot . i am the first to say what good album have a bad sound . this album is not a bad live album . the best song are the one from the first two or three . the rest of the album is boring .
1	i bought this book for a very specific reason . this is the first time i have felt so strongly about one of my pet peeve that i have had to write a positive review . i am not going to even bother to explain why i am so excited by this book . suffice it to say , this book is great .

0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i have only ever heard this recording , but i have never heard a better recording of the chicago symphony orchestra . this is great . i love it . this is the best recording of the best orchestra i have ever heard . this is the best recording of the chicago symphony orchestra . i have only ever heard this recording , but i have never heard a recording of the

1	this recording is a good mix
1	this is my favorite song on the album . if you can not tell from my review , wedding song is my favorite . it is the most annoying , yet the most beautiful song on the album . it is a perfect song . the chorus is so catchy . it is about how he is really happy with her . it is about the way he see her . i just love the way he describes her . he say , i like you more each day , and each day i see the beauty in you . you see it in my eye , you are the reason that i am so happy .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i do not like this album . it is a shame because i love david lee roth . i am glad that he had the chance to record a new album and i hope that he can get back to the music he had before . i am glad that he is recording again . i am glad that i have had the chance to see him live . i am glad i have the chance to see him play live . i am glad i have the chance to hear his music .
1	this cd is amazing . i wa not disappointed . the music is great . it is a gift for my brother .

0	[ brandy ]
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	wow . i am not sure what it say about me that i am surprised by this . i am happy to see that there are still people out there who are willing and able to purchase and own the kind of music that i like , and i am pretty sure that i will be purchasing this cd . i am also happy to see that it is actually not that expensive . i know that cd are always getting cheaper , but to me , this is a great deal .
1	this album ha some great instrumentals . i like this album a lot !
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	this is a very good song . i like the cover very much . i will buy this song . the only problem is that i do not have a cd player .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	a great mix tape with a great live performance .
1	i found this to be very enjoyable . it reminded me of the song he had on his first album .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	this is a great song , but it is just not the kind of song i wa hoping for . i wa hoping for an art pop , or even a more traditional rock song . but not this art pop crap . it is not the kind of song i would have ever chosen for my christmas list ( i know , right ? you see , i am a big believer in the notion that music should be about more than just just the lyric . of course there are the lyric , but there is more to music than just the lyric ) .
0	great song . it is not the one i heard when i wa little . it is just different . i like jazz . but i am not listening to this cd . i will just take my money and buy another jazz cd . this song is just like lucky man blue . i do not think it is a jazz song . it is not the one i heard when i wa little , so it is not like i thought it wa . it sound like all the other jazz song i have heard . they all sound like this song . they all sound like lucky man blue . the song is repetitive , boring , and boring . the lyric are terrible , and the sound quality is average . it is not a good jazz song . it sound like all the other jazz song i have heard .
0	i think this is the best song on the album . i love it ! i am glad i did not listen to the live version .
0	i am not a fan of this song . i have listened to this song on the radio a few time , but i could never get it to work on my radio . i thought it wa really good , but i could never get it to work . i think that it need some more of the instrumentation that the beatles had and the instrumentation used in the beatles version of this song is not there in this . this is a really good song to play on the radio , but i think that it would be better if there wa more of the instrumentation that the beatles had used in the beatles version which wa not there in this version . also , it need more guitar solo in the beatles version which wa not there in this version .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i like this music , but i do not want to get lost in the mix . this album doe not work for me . i do not like the song it is over and some of the lyric . i do not like the song that sound like they are going to be hit , they do not have hook . i recommend listening to this album if you like a band with a good sense of humor , good song with good lyric , and good instrument .
1	i love it . i love bonnie raitt
0	i have been a fan of ornette coleman for year and i have been so happy and excited to finally get this collection . i am not sure if i should be excited about the song or not , but all the song are very good . i am very surprised about all the song that they played including the best of the best by ernie . every performance is unique and i am looking forward to listening to the music and finding out what all the hype is about . i wish i would have ordered the entire collection but i am glad i got some of the song .
0	i like it .
1	fat waller is one of the most influential jazz artist of the 20th century and , like many other great jazz artist , he only recorded a handful of album at this time . this collection is an effort by universal to bring these recording to the mass . there are many different genre that waller covered , so this collection can be used to fill gap in any collection .
1	i have listened to this many time through my car stereo and can not find the hidden message . the only song i did not like wa the garden of eden , but i could not get past it . the cd wa well packed , but the booklet had a few error . otherwise , i would not hesitate to give this an 8 star rating .
1	i wa never a huge mariah carey fan until i heard this song , i will always love you . it make me cry . i love her voice . her music is so beautiful . i wish that she could still be alive . i wish that i could still see her . she sound so beautiful . i hope she will be still alive for my kid to see .

1	just got this cd . it is just the chicago symphony orchestra . it is really good .
1	this is not my favorite song .
1	this is a really good find . it is not one of the re-issue cd , but it is close . i am a fan of the band so i bought this for the band . it is a great album . i am sure the band will release a new album .
0	this is a good song . nothing outstanding . i believe this is the second song on the album . it is a good song . nothing exceptional . the song is just average .
1	it is so good to hear music from the past . i love hearing jewel again .
0	i am on the fence for this one , it is not too bad but i have found i am a lonesome fugitive to be a better song . i think that both of these song are great , but i am leaning toward the pistol annies version .
1	this cd is awesome !
0	this song is from the movie a beautiful mind . i do not understand why they used this song in the movie . it doe not have anything to do with the movie .

0	what is worse than a self-titled album ? what is worse than a self-titled album that you have to pay a dollar for and then have to wait a month for it to be in your cd player ? well , if you put this on your cd player , you would have to listen to it . i could have listened to this for a long time . i just do not want to pay for something i do not want . it is not worth it .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	this is one of my favorite
1	this is a great song , but i would like a bit more of the background . this is not a dirty money type of sound , but a more rockabilly type of sound . i think this is a great song , and i will be purchasing it .
1	this album is a must have for any woman collection . marie ha such a beautiful voice that is very easy to listen to . i love the way she sings and her performance is very sincere and beautiful . i would highly recommend this cd to any woman and her family and friend . i am sure it will be a hit with many woman and it is a real earful . i am glad to have discovered marie .
1	i love this album . i really like to listen to album of this type . i have also received the cd in a cracked case and the cd is cracked . the cover is beautiful . i have to have the cd in a jewel case to get the cd to stay in the packaging .

0	i am sorry to say this song wa not on the album . i think the song is very good . the message is very relatable , and it is a very cool song to listen to .

0	this album is terrible . i have no interest in the album of any other band ; this is my only reo speedwagon album . i have to hand it to them , they are an incredibly talented group . the song are good , and i liked the album overall . i do not know why i even own this album . i have a couple of other album by them , one of which is by far my favorite . but i do not think it is a good album .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

0	i have to be honest . i am not sure what to make of this . i know that she is doing a breakup song and still releasing it , but i really liked the video and i really like the album she is making now . my only dislike is that she is singing about her father in the first song . i know that she is trying to break up with this guy , and i hope she will get back with him .
0	a great show , well worth the money , but the sound is awful . i have been going to the theater since 1969 , but i have never heard a show where so many of the character were so horrible .
0	i think this is one of the best song i have ever heard . very cool song !
0	this song could have been so much more if it had been sung by a different artist .

1	this is a good album , but it is not a great album . it ha a lot of good music on it , and it make it easy to listen to , but it is not a great album . but that is beside the point . i have never been a fan of perry como , but i wa a fan of the perry como album that wa released after his death . i like the perry como album , and i like the new perry como album . i have liked every perry como album that wa released , but this one is my favorite . but this is not the perry como album i like . it is a little different than his other album . it is a little different than his last album . it is a little different than his first album . i like it a lot . it is a perry como album , and it is my favorite . but it is not my favorite perry como album . i think this album should be renamed , the perry como album , because it is not a perry como album . it is a perry como

1	i like this album . it ha a nice sound and is very well produced . i did not know what to expect from this album , since i usually like the old rock from the 50 and 60 . i do wish that there wa more variety in the song . i like the production of this album , which wa done by the talented tommy lipuma . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , who wa very well-rendered . i did find the song a-n-g-l-e-y to be very catchy , with the very first line , but most of the song were very slow . i feel these song could have been a little more upbeat .
1	this song is great ! i have not been able to play this song in a long time but when i did , i had flashback to when i wa a teen and would play it and think about everything that wa going on in my life . i would have to be able to relate to the song to know how powerful it is .

1	i bought this book in the hope that it would be a fun read . i wa wrong . this is a beautiful collection that is filled with great music . i have listened to all the album in this collection and i am now a fan of the work of michel legrand , robert schumann , and sergei rachmaninoff . i would suggest that anyone who love classical music , and especially those who love jazz , should purchase this book . it is a wonderful collection and it will make a wonderful gift .

1	this is a great song . this is a great song . i love this song . this is a great song . this is a great song .
0	very good overall song . the chorus is great and the verse is a nice change from a typical happy-go-lucky country song . it also contains a really cool ending to the song .
0	i have no problem with other illuminati who wholeheartedly recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase from the beginning of the work and the ensuing development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo – it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very centre of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action a few second ago wa .
1	i love this song
1	i am looking for a song to do for the site . i have a few idea and i would like to get opinion . the song ha the same feel a a good song . there are a few problem though . the song doe not have a chord progression . the song repeat though . i will be adding to the song a i go . i will be adding to the song a i go . there are some possible problem

1	i liked some of her old song . some of the song are great . i like her song .
1	in a time when many were afraid to speak out against the vietnam war and the government lie , this song could be a powerful weapon . the lyric are very powerful , inspiring courage in the listener . a little on the political side , but not to the point of being offensive . a nice and soothing song .
1	this is a great cd . it is not my favorite , but it is a great cd
1	this is a great song . it is a song that i could sing along to . the best thing about this song is that is us a lot of the syllable that you already know . this make it more fun to listen to !
1	i wa in the process of making a cd , and i read some review about this album and decided to purchase it .
0	i do not really like this album . i heard it wa a hit and thought it wa a great album . i do not know why i did not like it more . maybe i did not listen to it enough . the song are good .
0	i am not the kind of person to complain about a good product . this cd is not great . for people who like their music rockin . i had to force myself to finish the 5 song . that is all . there are way too many bad song , and way too many good song . i wish it wa a cd of just song i like . i could only listen to the dave clark five on this one cd . it got a thumb down from me in the amazon rating . i will have to wait until it sell to get a cd with only my favorite song .

0	this album ha been a huge influence on me . it ha a lot of different band that i have never heard of , but i love every song . a good alternative rock album for sure .
0	i think the only reason i did not give this a positive review is because i feel that many of the song on here are not very well suited for worship . i think it is the fault of the writer . many of the song contain some of the most cliche lyric imaginable . i think that is the most disappointing thing about this album . i do not like the song on this album . i do not like the lyric on this album . i do not like the music on this album . i do not like the production on this album . i do not like the song on this album . this album is a little too overproduced for my taste . i do not like the song on this album . i do not know why this album is even put out . i do not like the song on this album . this album is awful . i am sorry to say this , but this album is awful .

0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i love this album . i wish i could play it by ear .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i like music more than anything , and the only reason i bought this cd is because the cover looked nice . i would not buy it again . it is the most boring cd i have ever listened to . i would give
1	i have to say that this album ha been a real eye-opener . i wa expecting a bit more from this album than i have , and i really do not know enough about this kind of music to even begin to judge it properly . i have heard a lot of people say that this album is not mainstream but i disagree . it is very mainstream . i have listened to it on the drive to work . i have listened to it in the car when i am trying to fall asleep . i have listened to it while i am walking to work . and i have listened to it when i am doing some extra housework or doing some other chore that i do not enjoy . in short , i have listened to it all of the time . it is that good . i have been doing housework for about a month now , and i can tell you it is going to take some time to get used to it . however , i have to say that once you get used to it , it is really enjoyable . i highly recommend this album .
0	not bad . not great . just good .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this song is just really bad . it is really annoying .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i am not a huge fan of these group , but i really like this song and the song is nice when you listen to it with the right attitude . this is the first time i have heard it , but from what i can tell , it sound like a mix between the verve and the crib , which doe not really fit with what i normally listen to , but the singer ha a lovely voice and make it all the more enjoyable . i am not sure how this song is on the cd , but there is not a huge difference between the 2 version of this song , just a few subtle difference .
1	i like singing with tom scott
0	the song just doe not do it for me .
1	i love this song and the cd ! i have listening to it all day ! i think everyone should have a copy of this cd ! : )

0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	great song ! i really like the lyric and the music . it is a little annoying that the video doe not work on certain browser .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i feel like i am a little late to the party , but i wa looking for something to listen to while working out , and this wa it . i wa looking for something different from the typical trance/dance music i listen to on the radio . i bought this album , and it is absolutely worth the money . i will be listening to it for a long time . there is nothing to complain about .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this is very good . the beat is great and the vocal are amazing .
1	this is a great song . i have always liked the guitar solo . i love this song . it is a great sing-along song .
1	this is the first album i have bought from this album . i think it is worth the money , but i have not had a chance to listen to it yet .
0	i like this set , and the reason i like it is because i have been listening to the recording of this repertoire for 40 or more year now . i have heard all of these recording many time . i can not think of any other recording that compare to them .
1	i donno . i like the album . it is a very good album .
1	i wa wondering what i would like to hear on the album . i have listened to a few of them , and this song is one of my favorite . i am not a fan of all the song on this album , but this song is my favorite . i liked the lyric and the sound quality of this cd wa great .
0	i really like his music , but his voice is not what i would consider to be a powerful singer . he is very nice and cool , but he is not very good at singing . he usually sings like a teeny bopper , and not a powerful singer . he is usually singing in falsetto , so he sound like a teeny bopper . he is nice , and i think he is a nice guy , but he is not very good at singing . i do not understand why he is still on the show .
1	i agree with you . i love this song . i can not wait to hear it again .
0	i am a sam sparro fan . i love his music . i also like to listen to music that ha good lyric . i have listened to many music album that have good lyric and this is one of them .
1	amazing album cover . i bought it for my wife and child . this is an excellent and memorable album cover . i have a lot of respect for this band , and i will be selling the album soon . this album is worth the price . i have listened to the album twice . the band sound and the lyric are excellent .
0	i just do not like this album .
0	i really like this song . i do not like it .
0	i have had this cd for several month and the first time i heard it , i wa like holy shit , this is a really good song ! my mood instantly shifted from gloom and doom to euphoria . i love this song . it brought a lot of joy to my day . i have gotten to the point where i would sing this song out loud , a if i am a cheerleader . i have found that i can not help but sing it out loud when i am with my family ( especially my son ) . i have never heard a song like this before . i am going to buy more cd . i want to have a much variety a possible so i feel different . i hope this review doe not make people think of me a a horrible person . i do not know why i even posted this .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i really like this cd . i think the song is one of the best i have ever heard . the song no hand is very good . the song no hand is very good . i think the song gangster is one of the best song bruno mar ha ever written . i think this is the best bruno mar album . i think this is the best cd of bruno mar . i think this is the best cd of bruno mar . i think the song no hand is very good .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	the first thing that struck an eye wa the lack of rhythm . the vocal are in there but the music is choppy and out of sync . the second thing wa the lack of the song that the band ha been playing and singing for the last 10 year . it is the song that we all grew up on that have been played and sung for so long . this is like having the same beatles song played over and over and over and over again . the lyric are simple and the vocal seem monotonous . the melody are repetitive and do not have any depth to them . when i first heard this cd i wa really impressed but after listening to it a few time i find it lacking . i am not sure what the point of this cd is unless it is to drive you crazy .
0	the climb by j.s . bach is a great song .
0	i did not like the song . it is not a bad song . it ha a good sound quality . i like the song .
0	another great version of the song !
1	i love this song . i have never heard this song before , but i love it .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	i really like the song . the song is catchy .
0	this song is a great song . this song is great . this song is great . this song is great . i love this song . i love this song . this song is great . this is a great song . i love this song . i love this song . i love this song .
0	i have a hard time choosing between this cd and lordes . i think there is something for everyone . i think there is something for everyone .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what ha been advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like it or you do not .
0	i love listening to this song . i used to sing this song when i wa a little boy and i loved it . i would love to purchase this song if it not available on amazon .
0	lyrically , this is really good . song title : i am in love with a girl named katie . lyrically : katie , i am in love with you . i am in love with you . how can i live without you ? i will spend the rest of my life with you . i will never leave you . never . never can you know me like i know you . i am in love with you . i am in love with you . this is the first song the album ha . i have only listened to the first 13 song of the album . there are many song that i have not listened to . i wish i could give a more positive review , but the lyric are the best aspect of the album . the song i can see what is going on is the only song that i have listened to . overall , i give the album 3 star and a 6/10 .
1	i love my window phone !
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	this is a great collection of song . most of the selection are very beautiful and have a unique quality about them . the exception is i have got a brand new heart , and that is a shame . but you can hear the beauty in the rest of the performance which is why it is a very good album
1	this is just the best cd i have heard . i have been a fan of reo since they started , and this is the best one yet ! they have a great sound for a country band .
0	this is a bad effort by ms. ponder to promote her book . i wa hoping that the short performance of the prince of denmark would be different , but it is just an old-fashioned love song . i do not think a recording of ms. ponders voice performing the song is worth that much of a song . it wa done on a cassette recorder and would have been better off recorded in a studio . i listened to two song on this recording , but only heard one half of it . i know the prince is a popular figure , but this is just a silly effort to sell book series .
0	awol nation is not a good song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i can not tell a lie is what i think this song should have been called . it is a fun and catchy . i am not sure about the video . the song is very easy to sing and dance to .
1	this is for the people who tell me i can not do anything and that i will never be successful . i am a failure because i believe in myself and i am a woman of color . i am a failure because i am a woman and i have a voice . i am a failure because i am a black woman . but if i am not a black woman then i will be a failure . this song is a perfect encapsulation of the struggle we all go through in trying to find ourselves and our true voice .
0	i do not usually like rap , but i really like this cd because of the good song . i would recommend this cd to everyone , but i will not listen to this cd every day .
1	this album is so awesome
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	i loved the album , but i am not a huge fan of the album .
0	i have this cd for a couple of month , never listened to it , but , it is a good cd . it is a hard rock cd , but i like it .
1	john prines one day like this reminds me a lot of the grateful dead . the guitar and the wailing at the end are very good too .
0	you have to be kidding me . i have had a song from b.b . king on my ipod and i wa thinking about buying the song but i had to go to the apple store to buy it . what are you people trying to do ?
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i like what i hear on this cd . the case it broke in the mail and i am very mad about this . very good sound .
0	i liked this album , but i did not like the song . i wish i had not bought it .
0	i bought this album to listen to it on my car stereo . this is a very good album . it is very hard to listen to but it is a very good album . i would not waste my time writing a negative review on this album . i would buy it again . it is not worth the money i paid for it .
0	this song is a little too long and sound like it should be sung to a tape recorder .
0	i really like this song . this is a great song . the music is so good that you will have to listen to it over and over again . this is the best song ever . the lyric are great .
1	i like this record
0	i like the dave clark 5 song they did in the 1960s . they are very relaxing .
0	i think they are trying to make fun of the song . you have to wonder how long they expect it to go on for . i have been listening to this cd constantly for about a month and have only listened to it twice . it is really annoying .
0	i would say that this album is good , but there are a lot of song that could be cut out .
0	i am a huge fan of this artist . i have listened to her music since i wa a teen . i love her voice and lyric . i love her music . i would buy this cd if i had the money .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i have been listening to this album for about 15 minute . i can not even say that i like it , but i like it . it is a little bit like listening to one of those crap album that is the worst thing you have listened to in your life . i know that it is not the best album i have heard , but it is still good . i can not say that i do not like it . i like the music , but i do not know that i will listen to it again . i am not sure , i am just not sure what to say . and i am not sure how to explain it . i think that i will wait to listen to the rest of the album . i am not sure what to say . i am just not sure what to say . i am not sure what to think .
1	this is my favorite trance album . i love it .
1	i am a big fan of this band and they have played quite a few time at my house . this is a very good album that will be played often . the song are very good and the vocal are great . i like the instrumental on song two . the bass player is great and the drummer is okay . the guitar playing on other song is good .
0	this cd ha a great deal of variety . i like the fact that you can listen to it with or without the radio on . there is variety to this cd . it is always a good cd to listen to .
0	i like this song , but i think this song is a hit .
1	this is a great song . it is the first song i heard from her , and it immediately sticked with me , so i bought the whole album . i also love the music video , since it is quite disturbing , but still so awesome , that is hard to not be entertained by it .
1	i love the beatles and this cd .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i really like this album . i think
0	so , i have to give this an overall rating of 2.5. i am not sure if this is a good album or not , but it sound amazing to me . i have to say , i have not listened to this album in year , but i have listened to all of the album of this band . i give this 2.5
1	i think this is one of my favorite song ever . it is so beautiful . i have played it to many people and everyone ha loved it . i have also played it to people who thought it wa just a boring love song and they loved it . it is just so beautiful and a really beautiful love song .
1	yes , i am a christian , but a catholic at the same time . i have listened to several cd , but this is the best one yet . very inspiring and moving . i love the music .
0	this song is really good and i love it . it is a good song to listen to in a group .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	i like the music . i do not like the video .
1	so far this is by far the best song i have heard from this cd . of course i do not know what song she is talking about , but it is a nice song . i liked the song to start out with , but the song wa not what i expected , i had been looking forward to this cd , but it ended up being a disappointment .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i would recommend this to anyone who like rock music . the music wa very good and the story wa good .
0	i love this song . i love her voice , her body , her style . it is so beautiful .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	this album is a real testament to the dave clark five . you have to dig deep into your heart to find a song that doe not have a great guitar solo by paul humphreys . the song selection is awesome . i have listened to this album over and over again . they are great musician !
1	i have bought a used copy of this cd and it play fine . it sound like the cd player is too loud - so i am going to buy a new one .
1	this song is great , i love it , and i recommend it to anyone who like country music .

1	a friend of mine bought this album after me . i did not know that this album wa so good .
1	i love this album and the music is so diverse , and the video is amazing .
0	this is one of the best song this year and maybe the best of the whole season . got ta be you is a great song and i do not think it is far from the top spot .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	the first cd had an interesting selection of song , but the second cd is just a bunch of song i have heard , and never liked .
1	this song ha a nice beat to it .

0	i wa never a big fan of bonnie raitt . my first album wa i love you , you are perfect , now change and although it had some good song , i did not really like it . i have listened to quite a few album of hers though and i really like this album . i think it is her best ever .
0	i liked some of the old song . some of the song are great . i liked some of the song she did in the old day . i liked the cd she made with jerry .
1	the guy in the song is just so damn cute ! he is singing about a girl he really like , but the girl not into him . the one thing he doe have is a pretty good voice .
1	i love this song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is just a really good song . this is my favorite song .
0	the whole album is amazing . i like this album , but i do not like her voice at all . i like her voice , but the song are not up to her standard . i have yet to be convinced .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .

1	bonnies voice is amazing here ! great song !
1	this song is awesome ! i got the cd cause i thought it wa the clean version . it is just a good a the one on the album .
0	this doe not have a good beat , but it doe have a good feel .

1	i received a cd and a copy of my cd from amazon . i wa so excited when i got the cd and i love it ! i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard this on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio i could not believe it . i also received a copy of my cd and i loved it . it is amazing . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard my song play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio earlier today i could not believe it . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if they will ever be released . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if i will ever hear them . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard me cd play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the channel i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never played me cd on the radio . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if those will ever be released . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard them cd play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on radio earlier today i wa very excited .
0	miley cyrus ha a lot of talent . i will give this some time and see if it develops into something else . i know people will tell me that i am just another fan and that is fine , but i am not . i just want to have the opportunity to see this talent grow . i will give it some time .
1	my son is a fan of your music . i just wanted to say thanks for the review . i have been very happy with the way thing are going and hope to continue having a positive relationship with the band .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is a wonderful album . not my favorite , but the best of the one i have purchased . it is a great collection of song . the vocal are wonderful . i love the song . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i do not know why this album is so unpopular . it is very good . i agree with other review . i think the band is a little too similar to the last album and i do not like that at all . i do think the band is a little better at playing live than at recording . there are several song i like , especially the title track , a little too late , and the house that jack built . i do not know why this album is so unpopular ; it is very good . i enjoyed the last album , but i am not a pleased with this one . it is not perfect , but it is good .
1	i like her voice .
0	this record is so awesome !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a while and it really is a great cd . i have been enjoying it and am looking forward to the deluxe edition .
0	this is just a bad album , and i think it is one of the worst album i have ever heard in my life .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	bruno mar is a very talented singer and writes very good music and this song is one of the best .
0	i don t like jazz , but i like this cd . i really liked the song i heard . i am not sure about the album a whole , but i am glad i bought it . i think that it is a good cd , but i do not feel like i like them or like the song that i really like . i do however like the song that i like .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i am a huge fan of this artist , and not sure why i can not find this cd . i searched literally everywhere and found nothing . not even on the internet ! i wa about to throw it away when i found out it wa here , so i decided to order it . it came today and i am so happy to have it . thank you very much ! this album is one of the best trance album i have ever heard , and i have heard all of r. kelly album . this is a must buy !
1	there are some great song here , but most are from the 20 th century . a beautiful and unusual collection . each song is a gem , a treasure .
1	i liked this song , but the video is a little cheesy .
0	a very good album from a very fine singer . a few of the song are very well done , but overall this is an average album .
1	i have only listened to this album once and i loved it . it wa very touching and beautiful .
1	this song is good , but the video is a little much .
1	i love this song . i always have a cd in mycar , so i can listen to it whenever i need to . the lyricsare very meaningful .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i love my i phone !
0	i have been waiting for this album for several year now . i have a collection of more than 10,000 song , and i have only listened to one album by the same artist . i now look forward to it every day .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i like this radio show . it is really good .
1	i bought 2 cd of this band from amazon and both cd played on my ipod . i am glad i got 2 cd because my ipod only play cd that play on it .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i really enjoyed this album ! i have not listened to this album since i wa in high school , however it is still a great album .
0	this is one of those song that only a few people could appreciate it , and there are many who do not . it is really great , but not everyone ha the same concept of what a good song is . i like the way the song is structured , and the way the word are sung . it make me feel different than i would normally feel . the only thing i do not like is that there is no vocal on the outro . i do not like that .
1	i used to love listening to the dave clark five . now i listen to them only on their album and with people who do not mind . i would love to be able to listen to their cd without the annoying part they play . robert
0	i am a big fan of the reo speedwagon from the 1980s , & i really enjoy this album . i have a lot of reo stuff , & this is one of the few cd i have not heard . i would like to have this cd , but i can not find it in the itunes store . thanks !
0	this is just terrible .
0	i have not bought the album yet , but i have downloaded it to listen at home , and i love it . it good music , i like it .
1	this is the only time that i have ever heard this song . it is just beautiful .
0	i really like the album . i have been a fan since i wa a child , and i have always liked the band . i love their music and i really appreciate the band . this is a great album to have if you like power and rock and roll , or if you are a fan of older christian music . i hope they will make another album soon . i really hope they will make a new album soon . i have heard in the name of the lord is the best song on the album , and i hope they make another album soon .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

0	love the singing , but overall a little too fast .
1	this is an album that show that sam sparro is a great jazz musician . he combine old and new jazz style and then make them sound great . this is really a unique sound and add a lot of interest to the traditional jazz music . this is a very well produced album that is also very enjoyable to listen to . i highly recommend this album .

1	this is the best cd i have ever owned . it ha some of my very favorite song , and i love listening to it in the car and even when i am walking in the grocery store and have to be quiet .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i bought the cd because i like sam singing voice . i love this cd . i can not believe i bought it .
1	i am a big fan of jewel and dave clark music . i love tiger moon because of the great beat , and the lyric are really good . i have been a fan of their music since heart of stone which wa the first cd i got . i have been buying their cd since the first one in 1964. i hope they come up with a new song .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i really do not like this song . i used to like it , but now i do not . i do not even know if i like it anymore .

1	i love it . the music is so beautiful . it make me cry . this is a great song .
1	this is a good album . i had a friend who wa a big fan of this group back in the 1970s and he had heard of the album and wa looking for it . it wa in the mail for me , and i wa able to listen to it and decide that it wa worthy of my time .
1	this is my favorite album from the 90 . it is not a favorite , but i love it . it is so cute .
0	this song is great . i really like it .
1	i have only had this cd for a couple of day but i am hooked !
1	this is the most awesome song ever . i used to listen to this song all the time and it is still one of my favorite . it wa the main reason that i bought my first guitar . i have not heard it on any kind of device or cd . i do not know the difference between the real song and the cd ( i had this song on my ipod ) . it is hard for an adult to just listen to a song without having the parent influence . i feel that a person should find the most amazing version for him or her and not pick one that is already out . i like the music and it is what i have always liked . i have listened to a lot of music since i wa a kid and this is the best version i have ever heard . i really enjoy it and it is what i have always liked . i have listened to more music than i can remember and this one is the best i have ever heard . i really enjoy this cd and i love it .
1	i had to stop listening to this album . i am not sure what happened , but i am sorry to say the best album i have ever heard , ever . it wa a little slow at first , but the rest of the album really gave it that extra needed edge , and i found myself looking forward to listening to it .
1	this is a brilliant recording with great music to listen to . the sound quality is perfect and the musician play very well together .
1	i liked this one the best
1	this album is awesome . i love the song . i wish that perry como would record a new album so that he can release more christmas music .
0	this is the best compilation tape of all time . i have always listened to the soundtrack album and have never had a tape like this come out , but it is still really good . the best song on this tape are rough and let u get rocked by the runaway . the soundtrack album are also good , but they do not have a many song and are just a bit more boring , especially if you are a huge fan of 80 music . this tape is a lot more fun , and it ha a much larger selection , with song by artist such a the replacement , the clash , janes addiction , the ramones , the offspring , the smashing pumpkin , and so much more .
0	i like the song , but i do not think i will have time to listen to this one .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is not a good cover . the song is not bad , but the cover is horrible . i am glad i bought this album . although , i wish they would have just made a real cover , like say , the damned .
1	i wish this album wa in the u . there are too many barbra streisand . why can not they make some more barbra streisand ?
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	this is an amazing album . i have one of the original album and this is my second favorite album . i love the album and can not wait to get another album to listen to .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i know i am not alone when i say this is the best cd i ever have heard .
1	this book is amazing . the story is filled with so many interesting fact and it make you want to learn more about country music . it is a must read for anyone who love country music , regardless of age . it is a must read for anyone who ha ever loved country music . i love reading book about country music because they are always so interesting . it ha made me want to know more about the music , and it ha made me want to learn more about the people who are really responsible for the music . i have enjoyed many different book about country music , and this one is the most fun . the history and background is fascinating .
0	this song is not a great song at all . it is a boring song . it is boring because it is not a good rendition of the song . it is boring because , for whatever reason , the singer is not a good singer .
1	i tried to return it to amazon , but they would not let me . i received an email saying my item wa shipped and my name wa on it . i wanted to check to see if it wa the same item i returned and it wa the same . i wa very happy with my purchase . i returned it to amazon and will order a music cd from them and tell them i did not receive the cd . they will not refund the money , though , so i am going to have to buy a music cd elsewhere . i would have paid a lot more than what i paid for this cd if they would have refunded my money . i have never had a problem with amazon . they are the best . i will wait for a few day and then order a music cd from amazon from the other cd i returned . i will let you know how it turn out .
0	i can not quite figure out where most of the song are coming from . i will just have to keep trying . mark
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

1	i really like this album . i bought this album on-line so that it would download onto my iphone during the afternoon nap . it sound very nice . it ha several song that are very relaxing and good . i would recommend this album to others .
1	this is a great song . i do not listen to much music and this is one of the few song that i listen to . i wa listening to it on the way to work one morning . there is something about the way the music play that make me feel like i am in heaven . i have been to heaven many time . i like the part about the sun shining through the tree , and the sun is a good thing . it make me feel better .

1	i had heard this album before but i wa just too busy to go to the store and buy it . now i have it and love it ! this album is one of the best album i have ever heard in my life . the cd ha good song . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	this is a good album . there are some great song and this album is not to be missed .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	the only reason i downloaded this cd wa because i had just made my decision to go back to school . i know i should have listened to the radio while i wa driving to school and listening to the music instead of just driving to school .
1	i like the story , the music , and the lyric . i would recommend this to anyone who like classic rock music .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	this is a really beautiful song . it is a very simple song with a beautiful melody and a beautiful message .
1	i know
0	keiths guitar playing is very good - not great , just good . it is nothing in my opinion he could not have done a little better , like on his recent album finger sight which i found very impressive . i like keith side , but i do not think he really is a great guitarist .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

1	i absolutely love this band . i first heard this band in the early 90 and have been hooked ever since . this album is what put this band on the map . this is their most underrated album . this is the band that influenced the entire pop music scene . one of the greatest song they ever wrote and still a favorite of mine after all these year .

1	if i could , i would do this song over a thousand time . the fact that it is an acoustic version make it even better . i love that it is acoustic , the intro is just perfect and the guitar and the backing vocal blend perfectly . i do not like the way the guitar sound too loud , but that is just me . it is not a very heavy song , but it is a slow ballad .
1	- i love mariahs voice , she is so beautiful , talented and ha a beautiful voice .
0	this is a great new radio show that is easy to enjoy . i love the sound quality , and the song are diverse . it is one of my favorite new radio show .
0	i think this album is great .
0	i do not know what to make of this collection of recording . i am impressed by the number of record i can get from it , but i am not overly impressed with the quality of the recording . the cd ha been recorded on the same date a a live performance at a venue called the bistro , in a city called bristow . i am almost positive that this wa done by the same group , and i am even more sure that the recording quality is very good , but i am not sure what to make of the set .

1	i am a big fan of the oldie . this album would be good for me a a gift , or for someone that like to listen to old song . it would also be a nice addition to an oldie album .
1	in a time when hip hop and r & b music ha become all the rage , it seems many producer and artist are trying to recapture the magic of the past by resurrecting popular music icon . one of the most popular and well-known is perry como . he is most famous for his hit that include you are the top and the girl is mine . he died in 1990 at the age of 78 .

1	i am an oldie at this . but , i wa very surprised to hear this song . it wa a new song to me . a friend had given me my first guitar and i wa just starting to learn song . i wa impressed by the guitar sound at first , and i wa happy to hear this one . i think the song ha something to do with letting go . what a beautiful song .

1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	this is very relaxing song .
0	i have not been very impressed with jewel album . i remember her being a much larger artist in the early 90 , but she is now a very small artist in the current music world . this cd is not bad , but it is not anything i would buy . jewel could have made a much better cd by performing a few of her song live instead of recording them on a computer .
0	good album . i do not know anything about him , but i like that it is not all about sex .
0	i first heard the music when i wa in middle school when i wa walking past the record store . i have been a fan of lareine since then . their music is very well produced and their instrumentation is top notch .
0	i bought this a a gift for my mother . she love her car and this is the only music that she listens to . i do not think she would have listened to it if it wa a little more country .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i love the music of the 50 and 60 . it is the most important time in history . this is not a bad album . i just did not like it . there is nothing redeeming about this album . it is too short . i am not a fan of 50 and 60 music . it is not even close to the sound that the music should have .
1	this song is a little on the dark side . it is got a good beat but the lyric are not very good .
1	i really like the album , and have listened to it on and off . it is not a jazz concert , but a love letter to the music .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	the movie wa a lot better and i really liked the song in the movie . i hope this song is used in the movie .

1	this cd ha some great song . i am sure if you like jazz you can find something to like here . the music is very nice .
0	
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i am a fan . this is a good song .
0	i am a music lover , not a music reviewer . i listen to a lot of music , find it interesting , maybe even a little inspiring . i have a long standing love affair with the eagle and tom petty , and have bought their album . but i have never bought any music by roxy music , david bowie , james brown , or any of the other artist i like . so , now that i have put my toe in the water , i want to share with you all a little of the music i have been listening to lately . maybe you will find something that will become a new favorite , and maybe you will not . either way , thanks .
0	i am a big fan of the original version of this song , but i wa also a big fan of the remix . it wa a nice change of pace . i wa disappointed by this release , i thought it would be the original version but in reality it wa the remix . i like the remix better .
1	i do not listen to cover . if the artist is good , i listen to them .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

0	i like the movie more than the song .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	this song is one of the best that i have heard . i think james taylor is a great singer and writer . this song is worth listening to .
0	i listen to this a lot . i think gene voice shine here .
0	this wa good but not great .
1	this is one of the best song ever . i will definitely put it on the radio , so it is a great song
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i bought this in a matter of minute and i will be buying all of the next one ! this is the first live album i have ever bought , and i am impressed . the song are all extremely well played and the performance are excellent . the vocal on the album are great .
0	i like these guy . i like their music and their image .
0	this song get on my nerve .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	just wanted to write that i can not stand this song . i find it repugnant and offensive . i find it depressing . very sad and depressing . i have always been a fan of gospel music . but , i do not like the modern gospel . i have been married to a man for 11 year . and , for the last 4 year , he ha been a very abusive and horrible man . ( i have to live in the middle of nowhere to get away from him ) i would love to hear some positive song . if i could buy one cd that just had positive song , i would buy many . but , the tune for me is god not dead . it is so positive . i am happy . i do not have to listen to the rest of the hit on this cd . i like the song that are spiritual . but , i do not like the song that make fun of and mock god . it is just a really bad song . i bought it 3 time so far . i am waiting for the 4th cd . it is supposed to be the best . i am not sure . i am not sure i will like it . i think it is going to be a waste of my money . i am going to give it to my son . he is 12 and like it . but , my son is gay . i do not think this could be a good message to have for him . i have heard it . i have not listened to it . i am just going to put it on my ipod and listen to it . i will let you know what i think of it . i hope it is the best . it wa my first choice . it is my second choice . it is my third choice . i am only going to write one negative review on this cd . if i do not like it , i will write two or three . but , i do not have to .
1	this song is actually catchy . it is a cover band . i will check out the other song .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i have only listened to one album from bruno mar and this is it
1	i have been a fan of jewel for a while now . i have loved all of her album since her first , which is the the black album . it is one of my favourite . i have been a fan of her since then and have been looking forward to this new album with the hope of it being even better than the first . i am glad i got it back . i love it and i do not know how i can rate it any lower . i love her voice and the way she sings . she is got a good voice too .
1	this song should be on everyones playlist . it is such a pleasure to listen to , even when you are not listening to it .
0	this is the only cd that i have bought so far . it is exactly what i needed . it is great music .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i do not know dave clark when i see him , but i hear him . i like his music and his song and i feel that they are timeless .
0	dave clark five are a great band in a great area of rock . this is a really good rock song . this is a really good rock song .
0	i love e.s.posthumous , but this album is a mess . it is good , but it is good for what it is , not what it could be , and the song is the worse of the album .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i think this song is so overplayed at the gym that it is now a joke . if this were the kind of song that you would hear in a movie to create a theme or background music , i would be more understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for the opening chord ) that get no applause . you are lucky to get a grunt .
0	this is a gift from my girlfriend . i love this album . she is awesome . i listen to this almost every day [ lover ] .
0	this is great ! i love the first song ! i am in love it sound like a jingle !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i have been using this app for several year now and i have never had any problem . it is very simple - you press play and it start playing . i am pretty sure it is meant more for kid than for adult , but it is been a great aid to my young daughter reading comprehension while she is trying to learn new word . i can not imagine why anyone would find it annoying .
0	i have been a fan of gnr since their first single in the late 80 . i have bought their album since then , and this cover is amazing . i do not care for the original cover .
0	i like this song . i like you . i am not sure why though . i could go on about this song but i think i wrote this review so you would think i liked it .
0	what ever happend to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it seems she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i am a fan of this site . the best thing about this site is the music . i love the fact that most of the song are original . it is great to see a site with original song . i did not have time to listen to all the song on this site , but i came across some great artist in the process of listening to the song . you guy rock !
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	what a beautiful album . the music is beautiful and it is the most beautiful album that i have ever heard . this album is filled with beautiful and emotional song . i would highly recommend this album .
0	i love this song . i bought it and got it on cd . i do not own a cd player and it would be a great gift for someone .
1	i am not a big fan of mike varney , but i really enjoy this album . the music is great , the voice is great , and the playing is good . this album wa released around the time that mike varney wa recording his first solo-album .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i liked this album . it ha some good song and some good instrumentals . i would listen to it again .
1	hasselvander did a good job on the show . i do not know what happened with the itunes version of the show . if you do not have itunes , you have to check the website and download the song .
0	this album is very well produced , and i do not know why i am not more impressed . i suppose i should be . the album is very well produced and ha a good sound . i just do not think that it is very good . the song actually sound very generic , and i do not know why it is so hard for them to write good song . there is no reason why it should be so hard for them to do that . not even the beatles need to write good song . they can write just a good song a any other band . the beatles should be able to write good song . but the only song that are written well are all you need is love and i wan na hold your hand . those two song are very repetitive , and really boring . and the rest of the song are just boring . i would say that there are maybe five great song on here . of those five , two are hey jude and all you need is love , and the rest are just okay . that is a shame because i like to think that there wa some genius going on here .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i have recently purchased several cd from amazon . i have been disappointed with the music i have bought . i have purchased several cd and have been disappointed with the sound quality . this cd wa the worst of the bunch . it ha a really bad quality of the vocal and the sound is terrible . i am not happy with this cd . i will wait for the cd to be released on cd .

0	this song is not just one of the greatest song of all time , it is one of my favorite song of all time . it is a very beautiful song . this is a great song to listen to on a rainy day . i love this song .
0	i had the pleasure of listening to the new 2 cd special release by the boston symphony orchestra on this day . the recording is excellent , but it is clear that someone took the time to play the note on the piano . how many cd can you listen to of the same piece of music ? i had to turn the volume down on this one .
1	i got this cd for christmas . i wa expecting a lot more from it , but it wa great .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	he is really good at what he doe and he doe it very well and i always appreciate his music . he ha a way of making old song sound fresh , and new song sound pretty much like they were written today .
1	i like the song . i like the way the song go . this is a good worship song .
0	i ordered this cd a couple of week ago , and it came today . it is a good cd . i am not sure why , but i thought the lyric for honey do not were a little odd . but i guess that is not the most important thing when it come to purchasing a cd .
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i just wish it would play for a longer period of time .
1	for a christmas gift it wa very disappointing . the song are good and the cd play well .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i love this record , but the one that come in a cd case is better . they are the same , just in a cd case . this one is in a plastic bag .
1	i am really enjoying the new music by the band . the songwriting is fantastic and the sound is awesome . i have been listening to this album a lot .
0	i am having trouble with this download . i get a message that say your download is currently offline . i tried to access it from internet explorer and it would not work . i tried to open it with safari and it would not work . i tried to access it from firefox and it could not open . i have been using this site for a few month and never had this problem before .
1	i have been a fan of bill evans for many year and this cd , which feature performance by bill evans , chet baker and wayne shorter , is a very fine and well-played collection of music .
0	i like the sound , i like the bell and the drum , it is a very nice little composition . it is very upbeat and just fun to listen to .
0	the song is great . the video is horrible .
0	this is a fun cover . i like the song and the movie version is better . it is more of a fun cover than anything else .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i love this album .
1	when someone say they do not like the beatles i feel sad for them . they may have had their ups and down , but i feel like they actually have a very bright future ahead of them . the beatles were the best band of their generation .
1	great album . this album is great , it is a great cover and the band is excellent . great production , and sound great . i really enjoy this album .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i love the song , it is one of my favorite in my entire life . i do not know anything about these guy but i like the song .

0	not lareine , but the voice of her sister . maybe the song from the first cd are similar to the one from this album .
0	this is just a great song .
1	dave & steve clark are a band that come from a small town called dacula in georgia in the south . they were discovered by a man named don wa who wa a big fan of the band . wa is a great man and his only regret is that he never got to meet dave clark . he wa the one that discovered the dave clark five . he is one of most important recording artist in history just like the beatles and the stone to name a few .
0	i have had this song for a while , i think i can say a a whole i do not like this song . it is not my cup of tea . after hearing it for the second time , i wanted to throw the cd and the cd player out the window . i do like the song , but i do not like the song . after hearing it for the second time , i wanted to throw the cd and the cd player out the window . i do like the song , but i dont like the song . i have had this song for a while , i think i can say , a a whole , i dont like this song . it is not my cup of tea .
0	the clash were one of the first punk band to really use their music a a statement about society and politics . the clash are a great band and this album is a good representation of what it mean to be a punk . the album is a mix of punk rock and reggae and the band really put good lyric and production on this album . the music is great .

0	i am not a fan of this song . it is really boring and i just do not like it .
1	this is a great cover , but to amazon : why is this here ? i know this to be true because i do not own this cd and any reo speedwagon music
1	if you are looking for a great artist to listen to , i would recommend bonnie raitt . she is one of my favorite singer and she is very good at what she doe . this album is great , and it got me back into her music .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i like this song , but the lyric are repetitive . i like tom wait , but you can not expect to sound like him in every song he sings . i like this in the way it is done - it is very different from the others and the quality is good .
0	i bought it because i really like this song !
0	i really like the music on this cd ; i just do not think it is a enjoyable a the previous recording by this artist ; however , i do like this record : it is not too big . it is not too small either . it is a good size .
0	this is a parody of the original gnr song you shook me all night long , but instead of the original singer , this is a girl singing it . if they wanted to be gnr , this is the worst cover in the world on a stupid joke .
1	this is a great song , i really love the video .
1	lareine is one of my favorite artist . she is such a talented , creative musician . i love her music . i am glad she is back . i am sure she will be remembered .
1	great album . i really think that jp is a great guitarist . i like the way he can play in many style . i wa a big fan of his guitar playing on rise up but this one is better . his vocal are great too . he ha a unique style . i think he can do everything on this album , just a well . i think he ha a bright future ahead of him .

1	the best song of this album . it is a very good song . i really enjoy the lyric . it ha a nice guitar sound and it go into the word very well . i like the voice from barbra streisand and the singer from the chordettes . the song is very well sung . i am surprised the song ha come all the way to the top of the list , because i do not think it is a very good song . i am surprised the album will not go all the way to the top of the list .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i like e.s . posthumus best of all the cd that i have received . it ha great music and picture . i have not been disappointed yet .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i am listening to this at work , and the only thing i can hear is my coworkers laughing about what they are listening to .
0	this wa a bad song , but it wa actually good .
1	this song is awesome . i have never played this song in my life but when i did i had to cry . i have never heard a song that make me think so much and feel so deeply like this song .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	this cd ha so many great song that it is hard to choose . i have been listening to it for about 2 year and i never get tired of it .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this song wa great when i wa younger . never heard it before .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	a great song , well recorded and performed , but the singer is a little too low in the mix . would have been better , and the whole show , if the singer wa higher in the mix .
1	the beatles are my favorite band . i have spent hour and hour listening to them . i always look for their album in my record store , but i have never seen one here in the u .
1	excellent sound quality , and the album is very well produced . if you like jazz , you will like this . if you do not like jazz , you will not like this .
0	it is a song by brandy . in the video it wa clearly brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising . i just got it today , so that could be wrong .
1	i liked this song , and i think that the production is top notch . the best part of the song is the harmonica and the drumming , and the song ha a nice groove to it . the only problem is that the song end on a weird lazy way .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	sam sparo is a nice guy . he is an american who ha written a few song for an japanese band . he is done well on idol and can sing a little bit . he is cute and fun and doe not take himself too seriously . he is a nice guy , but he is not really very good
0	barbra is the best singer around , and for a little while this album wa my favorite . then i realized that the album is too long , and i wasnt buying it . i still like it , but i do not think it is a great album . it wasnt her best , but it wa good . i liked the song , but did not love the album .
1	this is a music cd . all i can say is that it is very good . i love the music . this is a music cd .
0	i just completed the process and this is not the first time i have received an error with this cd .
1	this is a very good cd .

0	this is better than the original , but not by much . the movie is better .
1	i thought this cd wa really good . i bought it for my son .
1	i like this song a lot ! i have listened to a few of the album and this one is one of my favorite !
1	this tape sound so great . i do not have any negative remark about it .

0	i am not a fan of the whitney houston genre , especially not the pop/r & b one . that said , she did have the most beautiful voice ever . it just sounded too much like other singer .
1	i am a huge dean martin fan . i have listened to this album many time . i am going to buy the deluxe version just to get the song i love . they are great , i am going to buy the deluxe version of the album just for the song i love .
1	so i wa looking for a new prince album for a few year . this album wa released a few year back , and it is a decent album . it is not really his best , but it is good
0	i really like this album but i only give it a 3. i have only heard the song when i have been to the store and listened to the album . it is not bad but i think it is a bit generic . i will have to check out the broadway album .
1	to amazon : your review on my product are great . i have recommended it to many people . i have told many people about this product . i thank you for that . if you are interested in getting a customer review , you may send me an email . i will read it and post it on my website . i will be happy to post it .
1	this is my favorite song from the movie and is a must listen .
1	i think this song is a good song . the beat is good .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i am a huge sinatra fan , and i have listened to this album many time . it is a great album that tell a story of love and loss . if you are a fan of sinatra , bing , dean , or any other singer then go buy this .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i am not a huge fan of this type of music but i am a huge fan of this band so i thought i would give it a try . the sound is very good for a christian band and they sing with a lot of passion . the lyric are very good too . i give this cd 5 star .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i have a long standing love affair with the work of john kander . one of the main reason is the versatility of his voice . on this recording , john kanders timbre is rich and warm and his range from deep bass to high treble is impressive . i wa initially drawn to his vocal prowess , but i found the arrangement to be a bit confusing . the overall sound wa good , but the music itself did not have much to offer .
0	this is one of my favorite indie album . it ha a great mixture of new and old song . they are a must for any indie fan .
0	i thought we were supposed to be rating the best live recording . the dave clark five , who recorded live in the same year a this recording , sound like they were having a good time . and i like them , even if i have no idea what they were actually singing about .
1	i think this is a really good song . i hope they do more of these type of song . this album is the best so far , and i know the rest of the album are going to be better .
0	the song , praise be the lord , ha been stuck in my head for the past few day . it wa on the cd of wicked praise , which i purchased at the last second . i wa a little disappointed with it , but not for the reason you would think . it is a worship song and i feel it is a bit too upbeat for my taste . i am usually more of a slow and steady guy , so this just doe not do it for me . i will be checking out the other song on the cd , but i think this may be a case of too many cook spoil the broth .
0	this is not a good cd . it had more crap song then i wanted . there is a song called the heart of prince that is a lot of crap . i do not like prince so i do not want to listen to this cd . i think this cd is a waste of money , but i wa willing to give it a try . the song are good . it is disappointing that this wa a part of a series that is supposed to help promote her book instead of promoting her cd . i thought the song were good . i think she would have done better on a studio recording . i would have bought this if it wa on sale for $ 0.00 .

0	to the anonymous reviewer : i can not believe you said that this is on your list of favorite album . i bought this album in the first week of december and have been listening to it ever since . i have only owned one album by bonnie tyler . i love her voice . the album is well worth the money . i believe it is worth more than $ 5 to me . and i think i might have to buy another . i have a hard time listening to it , but it is worth listening to . i do not want to give away any of the song , so i will just say that they are great . it doe not make the list of my favorite album , but it is the album that i listen to the most when i do not have time to listen to any of the other album .

1	i love the lyric and i love that it is real and not a cover . this album is what life is like when you are not at school or home , it is when everything seems to be going wrong or when you just feel alone . i love the lyric and i love that it is real and not a cover .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	this album wa one of my favorite one on the label , and i wa really hoping that they would rerelease it . i thought that the vocal were a lot better than the previous album , but the melody were not a good . i wa looking forward to the release of the album , but unfortunately , the album wa still not fully re-released . the sound quality is very good , and this album is still one of my favorite .

0	i am not sure i can say much more than that . these are good , but certainly not excellent . it is well done , but not memorable . it is still better than most of the christmas album i have listened to . very good . good enough that it get my vote , but not good enough to get me to buy it again .

0	this is a great album . it is not a great album but it is good . there are a few track that i do not like but overall this album is just okay .
0	i have it in my car , but i can not get it out of my head . it is probably the best album i have ever heard .
0	i bought these cd to check out new release , and i do not get it . why are these song on my page ? they are all from song that are on the cd the longest day but do not appear on the record a long , long way to go . i am pretty sure i heard all of these song on the radio , but i would have to check the actual album . i would assume that this is one of the many re-issues that are being made . i would think that someone would want to make enough money so that these song could be re-released on an album . i do not get it .
1	i got this for my son for christmas and he loved it . it is a good cd . he will play it every time he get home from school .
1	i love this song . i love the melody , and i love the way it end . it is sort of a crescendo . this song is a great way to end a concert , or just an intense practice session . it really get the music going . this song is a great way to end a concert , or just a practice session .

1	i don know what to say about this album . it wa amazing to me . it is so great .
0	this song is the best thing on the entire album . it is a very good song , and it is only on the cd . and it is by david lee roth . but they took a great song and ruined it by putting the real lyric on the cd . when you put the real lyric on the cd , it just seems like they are trying to be funny . it is just the wrong lyric . and that is why i give this album a 2 star rating .
1	i bought i bought the album because i like music . i am planning to buy it again soon .
0	i bought this cd expecting the same quality of the others , but it wasnt . i wa not disappointed . i listen to the cd everyday .

1	this is really good . this is the best beatles album . i like the beatles . i really
0	this cover is great . it is the perfect mix of the original and the original is very good . the original is a good song and it is hard not to hear in the recording . there wa also a comment about the distortion . i have been told i have a lot of distortion on my recording , but that is not the case , it is all just my ear and ear bud . but still , the distortion is well done . the guitar sound good and the drum are nice and i like the harmony . the vocal are a little weak , but the harmony between the instrument are very good . it is a good song . i would recommend giving this a listen .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing

1	a nice song for a nice album - and it is not bad either . i am not a huge fan of trance , but the album is a pretty decent collection of song . i just wish it wa a little bit more varied . the whole cd ha a good flow .

1	i thought this song wa a little cheesy , but the movie wa awesome .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this is another great album . i really like her voice and her album .
1	this is one of the best album of the year . this album is great . i will buy this album again ! i liked the lyric and the song . the album is a great album , and i will buy it again .

1	i really enjoy this album . i have listened to it several time and i like it , but i am a little disappointed in this album . the lyric are amazing and the melody are great . the only thing that could be better is the vocal , but other than that , this is a great album .
0	the song are fun and the band is great although the sound is like a bad 80 hair-rock band .
1	love it !
1	i would recommend this to anyone who like prince . i have listened to the original album twice and i did not hear any difference . prince greatest hit is the only album i have ever listened to twice and i am still not tired of it . it is one of the best prince album i have ever heard .
0	i like the song , but the music wa just a little fast for my taste .
1	the song are amazing . this cd is a must-have .
0	i think i would have loved to have met him . i saw him in concert a few year ago and he wa very good and i wa very impressed .

1	i would love to have this cd .
1	i love this song . it is my all time favorite . it is awesome .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i think the lyric are too long and the song is not very catchy . the song is a little too long for me to get into . but in all honesty , i like it .
0	i found one of the album that ha been discontinued . i can not get through this cd . i do not know why i still have it .
0	i am not a fan of their music . i do not know how i will ever be able to tolerate their music . i am not a big fan of this band .
0	this cd is good , but the sound quality is not very good . it sound better than the cd the red barn by the old 97s , but not a good a fool for love by alanis morissette .
0	this is one of the worst reo speedwagon album i have ever heard . i do not know why i even own this album . i do not like any of the other member of reo speedwagon , but this is one of their very worst album . i can not imagine any of the song on this album being on any of their other album .
0	i love this song . i have played it on my laptop and i have played it on a big speaker . it is very nice to listen to .
0	i am sorry but i can not take any credit for this . i just liked it very much .
0	this guy , who know , i will probably forget about him . he wa one of my favorite band , and i have literally read every song on every album he ever released , but this ? i listened to it once , and that wa it . did he really write these ? i mean these lyric ? i remember a lot of them . my favorite wa i would rather be a tree than a stone . i liked a lot of the song , but i do not think i will ever listen to this again .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i downloaded two song to listen to while i wa driving . i like to listen to different type of music while i am driving .
0	i am a bit disappointed with this cd , mostly due to the quality of the song .

1	this is a really good song ! i liked the acoustic guitar part in the middle . it is a very good song . it is about a guy , but it is kind of a guy that ha everything . he is successful , he is rich , he is handsome , and he know it all . he is the guy you want to be with , and he love her back .
1	the performance on this collection are all superb , but the overall recording quality is not up to par . this is not a fault of the performer , though . it is not even a fault of the studio . it is just a fact that this collection contains all of the performance on a single disc and that the music is mixed too well ( especially in the bass , where some instrument are inaudible ) . the sound is very bright , though , and i think it is preferable to what you could hear on a single compact disc .
0	i first had heard this song on the radio . i listened to it a lot . it is a really good song .
0	this is a great song . it is a great song because it is so beautiful . it is a great song because it is so beautiful . this is a great song , but it is too long . this is a great song , but it is too long .

1	this is the best of the two . she is amazing .
1	this is a great song . i like the song and you managed to get the artist right .
0	i do not really listen to much electronic music anymore , but i do like this song . it is fun and different . i like that they have a different sound that they are trying to incorporate into the sound of this album . if you like electronic music , you are gon na like this song .

1	great song and a great message .
0	i like the grateful dead , but i think that the price of the cd are a bit exhorbitant . i have been listening to them for year and they are the best in quality , but the price is $ 20 for a cd , when you get a cd for $ 10 .

1	i am a huge prince fan . this is the only cd i have ever purchased . i love the music and i can not wait to buy all of his other album . so if this is not your thing then you should not buy this cd , but if you really can not wait for the other cd then you should .
0	this album wa just a commercial for the record industry . the song are a far cry from jewel best work . the sound is so lifeless and the song selection seem half-assed . one of the few redeeming feature is that i am a man ( the title track ) is a real gem . it is the best song on the album , and it should be promoted more than the title track .
0	this is an ok album . the song are good and they are more like song that were in other broadway show .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .

0	a great album with a couple of good song . the guitar playing is good but i would have liked to have had more instrument on the album , like some of the other album i have listened to . the ballad are ok , but the song were too long . i would give this a rating of a- .

1	this is an awesome song . i am going to add it to my christmas collection .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i think this guy should be signed to a major label . i like him , he ha a great voice .
1	this song make me feel different than i would normally feel . i really enjoy the way it is structured and the lyric are sung . it make me feel different from the other song i have listened to . i like the way the song end with a very powerful sounding bass drum beat . overall , i highly recommend this song to anyone who like hard-rock .
1	this is my favorite song . i like the lyric . i like the melody .
1	i bought this cd and wa very surprised . i could not believe my ear . the song are all about love . the song are all about hope , faith , and the word of god . the song are great ! this is one of the best cd i have ever heard .

1	i think this song is great . it ha so many good guitar part .
0	i will consider buying this album again .
0	i can not stand this song ! the chord on the guitar are terrible ! i like this song but not the version in the movie !
0	i enjoyed the first three song ( including two song on the album ) on this album . i have always liked their style and wouldve been happy to buy the original album , but i did not have the fund for it . i listened to this album a couple of time and it is not bad . for some reason , i am not a big fan of the sound quality of this album . it is a little better than the studio version , but the sound quality is still far from good . i wa happy with the song , but it is not the same and it is not worth the money .
1	i wa a little worried that i wouldnt like this tape because i thought it wa a little wierd . i wa right ! i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! ! i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site !
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this is the first cd i have ever bought from amazon . it is been over 20 year since i have purchased anything from them . i have a little over 2000 cd and over 300 book . this is the first cd i ever bought from amazon . i wa not impressed .
1	this is an excellent collection of classical music , but it is not a classic collection . it is a good collection that i can listen to at any time , any day i like . i have several of these and i have never had a problem with any of them . i have had several classical music album , but i have never had an album that i wa not happy with , but this one is by far the best classical music i have had , period . the sound quality is very good . the set is great for any classical music lover .
0	i have to admit , i wa completely baffled a to why i had not heard this before . my god i do not know what to do with this album . it is everything i can not stand in contemporary christian music . it ha no redeeming value whatsoever .
0	i like dave clark five . i have only one negative thing to say about them , and that is the fact that their latest album is out on cassette , and it is not on vinyl , so i can not get it !
0	i am not sure who this singer is , i have not met her in person , but this album is pretty terrible . the vocal are terrible , the music is terrible , the lyric are terrible . it is just the whole album is terrible , it is like listening to the soundtrack of someone el movie . i would rather listen to the soundtrack of someone el movie than listen to this album . to be fair , this is a very good singer , it is just that she is not very good . to make thing worse , it is not a bad album , it just not very good . it is very good for the most part , but it is not good at all . there are a few good song on here , but the album a a whole is awful .
1	i really like this cd . i have listened to it many time . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i love this song . i have listened to it for year . i think this song is one of the best song ever . i am glad i found this song on youtube . i think that song deserves to be on mtv . i think this song should be on there . i will probably buy this song . i am glad i found this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard .
1	i love it , but i love the video even more . it is a great video .
1	this is a wonderful album . it is a great album . i have listened to it several time . i look forward to many more year of this album .
1	this is the song that play in the movie . the only thing wrong with this song is the piano version is better .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	this song wa played at the end of the episode the boy who cried wolf , where gob and his friend were out in the wood and gob wa going to get lost . i like this song and it wa played at the end of the episode .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i got this album for free on the day the album release so i wa really excited when i found out this album wa a re-release of the original . i really like the re-release of the original album because of the cover art and the fact that they re-released the album after 20 year .
1	this wa very entertaining . the story wa good . the music wa great . the tape wa very fun to listen to . i would recommend this to anybody who like rock music .
0	i wa looking for this song and could not find it . i really like the dave clark 5. he wa a friend of mine . i listened to the cd and did not like it . it sound like all the song on this album but the lyric are extremely offensive . robert
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i bought it from amazon a a christmas gift for my wife . i really like the cd .
0	i thought this one wa going to be an awful cd but i wa wrong , it is a great one .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is one of my favorite song . the first time i heard it wa on youtube . it is such a good song . i think it a good a uptown funk .
0	this is a very good album , but the lyric are offensive .
1	i love this christmas album so much . i am so excited to listen to it over and over and over again . i used to be a big fan of country music , but this album changed everything for me . i fell in love with it .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	this song made me feel good .
0	the cd is my favorite prince cd by far . it is not the same cd on the movie , but other than that it is amazing . it is just too bad that the cd got damaged during the mailing process .
1	this is a really nice song . very beautiful and touching . i love it
1	i discovered this group on the internet . i am not a fan of this band but i liked their music . i like the way they sing and the way
0	the song is really fun . it is super short . the lyric are a little annoying . i hope this album is good .
1	i wa in the car and wa listening to my ipod when i
0	this is an early recorded version of a song that never made it to a cd . i think if they had recorded it properly - and have it remastered - this would be a fine piece of music .
1	it is a good song , although some part are a bit annoying , i like the song , it is good .
1	love this band ! love the way they play ! love the way they look ! love the way they dress ! love them !
0	this guy is great i like his voice he ha a great voice and ha a band that is great also .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	great album . this album is very well done . it is a very good collection of track . i like this album .
0	i like this cd . it is good . i have listened to it about 5 time . it is good . i am glad that i bought it . i have listened to it about 6 time . it is good . i would recommend this to anyone .
1	i think this is a great album with some good song and some good song . i like what she is doing . she is young and she ha a good sense of humor .
1	this is a song i have always liked . i think it is a song about hope . hope in life , hope in faith , and hope in love . all of these thing can be found at different time , and this song is a reminder that we can all find solace and happiness in our life .
1	this song ha a very positive message , especially for someone with a bad day .
1	i really liked the album . it is different from her previous work , but well worth checking out .
0	this is not a good album . it is a waste of time . i do not understand why anyone would listen to this album . i am not a fan of bonnie tyler . this song is horrible . i do not know how anyone can listen to this . i am not a fan of the pretender either . the lyric are terrible . this is not worth the money . i do not understand why anyone would want to listen to this . this album is a waste of time .
0	i am a huge prince fan , but this album really is not my favorite . this is an album that really need to be listened to like a soundtrack . definitely not my favorite prince album , but the album is very good .
1	i wish i had bought this when i wa a teenager !
1	this is the only e.s . posthumus i have ever heard that i would recommend to anyone . k.g .
0	she is an excellent singer !
1	this is a cd that is beautiful . it is a good representation of the music that jewel ha produced for over 30 year . i am a fan of jewel and have loved her music for a long a i can remember . this cd is a good representation of her song . i am glad i did this purchase .
0	this album ha a lot of great song and i like them all , and the lyric .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	not a great program . i like the format , but it lack in-depth analysis . they do not analyze the song in depth , but they do bring up interesting theme and take on issue . i am glad they are still around , though .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i do not like this song . i do not like the lyric . i do not like the music . i do not like the fact that it reminds me of a boy i used to have back in the day . i am so glad it is not on the new album .
0	i loved gay trance 2003. the music wa very well done . i just wish the album had more song . but the music wa great .
1	i love the song . i am a fan of miley . i have a hard time with the word she is so young , and so beautiful it is one of my favorite song . i can not stand the video . a soon a i saw the first picture i wa disgusted . i am not miley . i do not like the song . i do not like the video . i do not like the song . i do not like her .
0	i have not heard of this artist before purchasing this album but i am glad i found this album . the album is good , but i would have liked to hear some more song of the same artist .
0	a surprisingly good song , with a catchy dance beat
0	this song suck .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	this song is wonderful . it is a lot better than the other song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	great cd . i am not a choir person , but i like this cd . i have given it to a group of singer that are not in a choir .
1	this song wa originally only sung by the late great jim reef , but ha since been sung by many others including bob smith , gary moore , and others .
0	this wa a good one especially for a dollar . i have had it for a couple of week now , but i am not sure i will continue to listen to it . i do not know if it is because i am bored with the music or if i am just bored with myself . i love music , but i hate the music i like . i need to stop listening to the music i like .

0	my daughter ha been singing this song to me since she wa just a baby . she love to sing it with me and she love it when i sing it with her . i love it and wish i could hear it all the time .
1	this wa one of the first time i heard this song . it brought back a lot of memory .
1	i do not know what this song is about , but it is a good one . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true lover of music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always looking for a song that brings him closer to god . i think this is one of his favorite .
1	i really like this cd and i would not give it a bad review , i like the song and the music on this cd .
0	i don ; t like the way she sings , but i would really like to hear more of her music .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i have to admit , i like this album . i do not know why i do not like this album , but i do like it . i did not know i liked prince until i heard this album .
1	this album wa released in 1989 , and it seems to be a great example of what a record company could do with a new band . i like the song , and would like to hear more from them . i also do not think this is a great classic rock album , but it is not awful either . i do like the cover .
0	i am a fan of her music . i have her cd and have listened to them at least once a week for the past two year . i have a friend that i listen to her music with . i am not a big fan of her music .
0	this song is great ! very nice !
0	this is one of the best live album i have ever heard . i like the song on this album . it is very long and it really is a great live album . it really show u what the band wa up to . the band sound great and the sound quality is great .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i like barbra streisand . her voice is very powerful .
0	it is so bad . it is just a video . it doe not really matter if it is good or bad , you can not listen to it , you can not make it better . it is just a video .
0	i think this song is great . i love the song .
1	this is one of the only song i have that i can actually understand the word . but , the music is nice . very peaceful and calming . thanks !
1	this is the best cd player i have ever owned . it really is the best money could buy . the sound is amazing . i would purchase it again . it wa a great gift for my father-in-law , and he is very pleased with it . he ha been listening to music on his new ipod for a good long time , and this is the perfect player to use with it . if you want a true cd player , you can not do better than this . now , i have to buy another one . thanks , composer .
0	i do not have much to say about the song . it is just a great song . the message is very relatable , and it is a very cool song to listen to .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i like this cd . the song on the cd are excellent . it is a very nice cd .
1	this cd ha a great sound . i really like the song .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this song make me happy and i want to dance .
0	this is not a good version . he take the best part of the song and throw in a bunch of crap lyric . the song is not all that bad but it is definitely one of the worst version i have ever heard . i think this is the worst version of i will fly away i have ever heard . i hate this version . i think it is the worst .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this album wa great , except for the music . i guess this wa the first ohearn album i purchased , and i hated it . it wa a very long album , and with all the talking and singing , it wa hard to listen to .
0	i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa in the truck . i really enjoyed the cd , but i think i will have to put it back . it is not loud enough to use on the truck , so i will use it while driving and just turn the volume up a little . i think it is good , but i like rap better .
1	this song is very sweet and very well sung .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

1	this song is great , with the exception of the ending . it is really good , i love the beat , but the ending is quite annoying . i do not like it .
0	very relaxing . the first song is the only pop song i know that is not a parody of some other pop song . other than that , it is all about the classic music of the 20th century .

0	i have a love-hate relationship with christmas music . i love christmas music , but i hate it when people try to make it their own . this is a great collection of christmas music and a classic . i find the vocal more impressive than the music . i have this cd many time each year and i have always found it very enjoyable .
1	this is my all time favorite album by marie osmond . the material is excellent and the voice is wonderful . it is a must have .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a long time now and it is by far one of the best cd ever to come out . this album is great . you can really tell that the artist ha a lot of talent in his/her hand . i can not describe the feeling that i get when i listen to it , i just feel that i am floating somewhere and can not help but smile .
0	i like gay trance . i think it is the best album of the series .
0	this is not a bad song , but i would rather call it not-so-good . it is catchy , but not very memorable . the instrumentation is pretty good , but the vocal are weak and the lyric do not do much for me to remember . i like the song , but i do not think i should buy it .
0	i am not a big band guy . i do not like them . but when i heard this album for the first time in 1985 i had to have it . this album ha the most amazing song , the most amazing musician and most amazing lyric . i can not get enough of this album .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	a very good old blues-rock record . a really great blue rock album .
0	i bought her a long gone story cd for my sister . i think it wa a good gift , i just wanted to make sure that i selected a good gift for my sister . although i did not like this cd i did not like her voice . she can sing and her voice wa very pleasant .
0	this is not a bad album , but i wa not really fond of tom wait . he doe not really try to be a great singer , but rather just sings what come to mind . i am not sure how tom wait can carry a tune or make a vocal sound like he is singing . i am glad i never saw the piano lesson or i would not have bought this cd , if it were not for the fact that i enjoy listening to tom wait so much .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this album wa one of the first album i ever got to listen to-not that i wa able to get to listen to this album-it wa released in 1985 and wa released in a limited edition-i am sure it wa limited by me . i remember getting this album-i wa 13-and i would play it for about an hour every night , my mom would tell me she loved it ( i had no idea what she wa talking about-i thought it wa a good album ) i remember listening to this album at least a dozen time and each time it just got better and better , there were time in the middle of the night when i would be playing this album for hour on end , and i still play this album a lot , it is one of my favorite album to this day .
0	i hate this song . dave is soo boring and i find it hard to listen to him because i know he can not really sing and he just ha a boring voice . i really dislike this song .

1	i like this song because of it unique sounding . i like listening to it while driving because when i listen to it i hear it in my head and when i sing along with it i can feel the energy in my body .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i have never heard this album and am starting to like it .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .

1	this track is an interesting one . the vocalist background sound like a classical singer i have heard before . the music is pretty good ( i did not know it wa a popular song , but it is ) . it is very sad music . if i had not already bought the cd , i would have ordered this one . it is a live performance , but they do have an acoustic version . it is a beautiful song , that will make you cry .
1	i love the song and think it is a great song .
0	this song can sometimes be very sad , and i really like the lyric . you can hear the girl singing the lyric and it make the song very sad .
1	the new jvj album is good . it ha a more upbeat feel to it . the new album is good . i like this album better than the last one . my cd player is playing better music than it used to .
0	this one is a little over rated . i can understand why someone would like it but not anyone else .
1	i have been listening to this album of the dave clark five for almost two month now and i can not get it out of my head . there are a few song on this album that i know i could never play , but they are just so good , like the title song , the gilded palace of sin and falling and flying . the song here are truly unique , and each song on this album is a song you just have to listen to . this is not just a good album , this wa an awesome album .
0	this song is not bad . but lorde is trying to make pop music here .
0	i love this song , but it is one of those song where i wish it wa sung by a different voice .
1	this is the best piano album i have ever heard . i listened to this song for hour and i love it .
0	i have to give this one a pas because i can not really get into it . but , i can say that i have been listening to it a lot . i think there wa a reason this song wa the first one on the album and i just do not think it is a good reason .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .

1	great song selection and great vocal .
1	i love the song . i love the version of it a well . it is an awesome song , but my favorite version of it is the one with the original version and it is original version .
0	i am in a little bit of a crunch at the moment ( on top of the cd ) so i decided to pick up a copy of the cd to try and fill in a few gap .

1	i am a long time fan of bill evans and have been collecting his work for a while , so i wa very excited when i received this cd a a gift . i have heard a lot of his music , but i have to say i have not listened to it all before . this cd is fine for the beginner . i am sure it will take me some time to get all of the different element of the music , but i know i will get it eventually .
0	i would rate this album 4/5 because there are some good track on the album and some track that i would have liked to have been on it . the song are really good and the production is excellent .
1	i have listened to this cd of song for many year . it is a very good and well produced cd . the song are well arranged and the sound quality is excellent . i would certainly recommend this cd to anyone wanting to listen to music from the first decade of the 21st century .

0	it is awesome , and i love the video !
1	this is the first album by this band i have heard . i have never heard the band before . the music is very reminiscent of the old rock and roll sound . my ear are open for a new band from time to time , and this band deserves more attention . i have listened to the album twice and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys pop rock . it is a very good album for the price . the song do not stop is very catchy , and the rest of the song are all very fun .
0	this album of worship song is very good . there are a few song that are really good , but the whole album is not very good . the song are not very long and the song do not fit with the style of worship . i have not heard any song that are not christian . the song are not worship song . overall , this is a good album that give a variety of song . i would not recommend this album .

1	this song is a great song . i like it a lot , it make me think of time i have been through and
0	i heard this song on the radio and thought it wa a great song . however , it wa too long . i think that is why it wa not really played on the radio .

1	i love the e.s . posthumus cd , but i do not think i will ever buy another by this band . the song suck . the lyric suck . the band suck . this album is a waste of money .
0	this is a very boring song and it is not even funny .
0	i believe the cd is a good record . i really like the way the song are written , the way it is arranged , and the way the vocal are done . i do not think this is a great record , but i am not going to give it a negative review .
1	this album is just a compilation of song from their previous album . but it is a good album . the song are good , and there are some good bass solo . i think this album is a good album , and it is not a good album for this band . the song are good , and there are some good bass solo , but there are no good drum beat , which is not a good album for this band . the song are good , but the lyric are not good . i would not recommend this album .

1	i love the whitney houston song ! i love the whitney houston ! whitney is one of the most gifted and unique singer of our time .
1	i just bought a touch of grey . i have been searching for a good song to listen to at the end of my day . this is it . i will now be able to relax and go on with my day .
0	this cd , while it is a fine recording , just doe not have enough punch to be considered great jazz . it doe have a great sound and the song are excellent , but it just doe not have enough substance to it to be considered great jazz .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i can not believe i forgot about this album . i love the band , but i just could not enjoy this album . i will not buy it , and will not listen to it . i will not listen to it again .
1	this song is one of my favorite david lee roth song . i love the way he sings it . i just can not wait to hear his new stuff , because i am sure that it will be amazing .
1	an enjoyable album with a great song on it . it the album that you wanted to listen to from start to finish . i do not know if it is my personal taste , but i have tried to listen to most of the album released by this artist and this is the album i like the best . i am sure that the trance album will be better than this , because it is more of a rock album , but i really enjoyed this album .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	a very amazing album . if you are one of the few people who still have not listened to this album , then you are missing out .
1	i loved this song when i wa a teen , but i do not like the version that we are all hearing on the radio . i can not understand why the radio station did not play the actual recording when they were recording the song . this is a very good song , and i really like the version of this song that is on the radio .
0	this is an oldie but goodie type album . she sings some oldie but they are very good . i like her voice .
1	when it came to the album , she basically wrote what she wanted to write for the album , which is what people who are into the whitney style of singing should be listening to ( i did not like the song love me , but that is probably a personal preference ) . the album is well-produced , and the song sound good . i do not know if that is a good thing or not , but it is all i can do to get a positive review .
0	this cd is excellent - i have listened to it several time and i love the guitar solo .
0	the album ha good song with some different artist in it .
0	i just went on amazon to buy this album and saw review for a best of of this album . i have listened to this album and liked most of the song . it is by far the best album i have ever bought . i would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates john mayer or jeff buckley .
0	if you have an ipod you have this cd . i bought it for my ipod and i really like it . i really like the sound quality on this cd . although it is a bit compressed , i would buy it again .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i really like this song , i just wish it would have been better .
1	i love this album ! i have listened to it several time . i do not like the song , but i love the album . i think it is great !
0	the song is great but the video is so ugly .
0	i like the dave clark five , but most of their stuff is kind of cheesy .
1	it is one of my favorite song . it is so simple , but every time i hear it , i find myself singing along . i also like the fact that it is not a duet , and it is not a duet that you can not sing along with .
0	i can not listen to this album . this album is very boring . it is very repetitive and uninteresting .
0	this song is not only a great cover but the original is not bad either . the first half of the song is pretty good , but the second half is just plain boring and just go on and on . i can not listen to the rest of it without getting annoyed by the repetition and lack of passion of the lyric .
0	i think i might have heard her song on the radio on the way over from the airport . i think this song may be her best song so far . i liked it . i liked the lyric . it wa a good song . i have not purchased the cd yet . i am waiting for the opportunity .
1	this song rock ! it is one of , if not the , best cover i have ever heard on a cd . a good rendition of the song .
0	i do not know what to say about this album . it wa amazing to me .
0	this is the album that started it all for me .
1	this song is a lot better than i thought . after listening to the first two song i thought i would not be able to like this cd because the first two song are very annoying . i had to listen to the song several time before i could get over the fact the first song made me want to get up and walk out of the room while i sat there listening to the second song . this song is great ! i did not expect to like this song a much a i did . it is a great song and i would recommend it to anyone who like a good song .
0	i have heard him sing this song a few time before , and i really do not like it . it is not a bad song , but it is not something i would listen to .
0	it is a little bit of a let down a compared to the others , but not a bad effort . it is a good song , but some of the lyric are a little harsh .
1	i received the first cd in a plastic case . the second cd that i received in a plastic case wa a beautiful cd . the cd wa in a
1	i wa wondering if i should buy it or not . i wa hoping for a good album . i decided to buy it since i wa hoping for a good album . i am glad i did . i am glad i bought it . i wouldve paid more for it if i knew it wa free but i am glad i bought it
0	this song is so bad it make me laugh . the worst thing ever . i really like this song , it is a lot better than it is video . i enjoy this song , i do not like the video though , but it is still cool to listen to .
0	i like this album . i love this album , especially the first half . i like the second half too , but not a much a the first half .
0	i would have given this a 4 rather than a 3 rating , but it doe not sound like it wa meant to be a ballad . the bass in this song is terrible . the vocal is ok , but the melody is terrible . the best thing on this album is you do not know me , but then the song is about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not know what to do . the vocal are a little too high for me to enjoy it . the only bad thing about you do not know me ( and there are many bad thing about this album ) is that there is no chorus . the vocal on this song are a little too high for me to enjoy it . a new kind of love is a great song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date , and he doe not know what to expect . there are great song on this album , but the vocal are not really that high for me to enjoy them .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to be refunded ! ugghh !
0	i bought it because i like the cd but i do not know it is worth the money .
1	this cd is great ! i have enjoyed listening to it on long car ride .
0	this is a good album , but one that i will never buy . i found it a little boring . the cd ha a great voice but , i did not like her song . i thought she sounded a little too much like madonna .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	great music and a great band ! love them .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i downloaded a song to my ipod using this site , and now i have to delete it . i have done everything it say . it say delete , but i can not delete it . i deleted the file and clicked refresh , and nothing . can someone help me delete the song from my ipod ?
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	this is a great song and i love mileys voice !
0	after the dave clark five last album , the cd contained a song called i am dreaming of a white world . i liked it when they did it , but i think it is a bit corny now . it is too bad they had to take it off the cd .
1	i received this album yesterday and i love it . i really like the music and the concept . also , my husband and i are getting married in december , and i would like to find song that are appropriate for our wedding . i have already begun looking and listening to song that are appropriate . i really like allan bole music . and , he is very talented . i would highly recommend this album to anyone .
1	this is an awesome album . i have all of my favorite album and this is currently one of my favorite album . i got this album a a gift a few year ago and i have listened to it so much .
1	excellent song and the music is very nice .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	i really liked this album , and i recommend it to all my friend !
1	the beatles are the best band , the best song , the best lyric , the best music and the best group in the world . i love the beatles and this is a must own !
1	it is rare to get a live recording of a prince concert . this cd is perfect . i do not know how i got it , but i think it wa bought from kinkos . it is been in my cd player for at least a month now and i just can not get enough of it . the show wa very well recorded and the sound quality is great . the crowd is loud and the band is very professional . and no doubt some of the best musician prince ever worked with . it is a great little gem and i hope they make a second cd ! the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because they played the song i did not get through the night , you and me . when i got home i looked it up and wa shocked at how much this song is in the medium , and i did not know it wa on this cd . i hope prince make more of these cd .
0	i am a big fan of your music .
1	this is a very good song . i love it .
1	john frusciante wrote this great song about how he is a true fan of reo speedwagon . of course , he is referring to the lyric and music of this song . ( it is really hard for me to find lyric for most of my song , and i am pretty sure those lyric are on here somewhere ) . this song is a good reminder that we can never lose that inner fan that we are . it is an important lesson that everyone should take time to listen to .
1	this is one of the best album ive ever heard ! all the vocal are amazing , the songwriting is great , and the music is great !
0	i love the album , but . the song on it are all really good . the only thing i do not like is the way the song are arranged- sometimes it is good , sometimes it is not . some song are like a duet , but others are like a duet of duet . but , overall , it is a cute album !
1	i really enjoyed listening to a cd . i love the song that came on the cd .
0	this is not his best song . it is not a bad a some of his other song . i like it . i would listen to it again .
0	one of my favorite is also one of the best . well , it is not a bad album . i just do not like the music industry . i just like music a it should be . this album is good .
0	this song is great . i can not wait to listen to this album .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i like this song , but i do not think it is a good a his other one . it is good , but not great .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i heard this song on a radio and thought this song is really cool . i hope you can hear how much i loved this song . you should play this song .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this album is not a good live album . it ha no tom wait and is way to long and boring . the best song are the one from the first two or three track .
1	i first heard this song on my way to work . it is such a wonderful song to listen to on the way to work .
0	this is not a song i would have picked to start my cd , but then i did not know what to expect . it is not even a song i would have picked to listen to if my dad gave me an album to listen to . even if the cd came with a bunch of other song i might have picked to start my cd , i would have picked this one .
0	i really hope this album is a joke . i have had the cd for about a half hour and already wish i had not bought it . there is so much wrong with it . the vocal are so bad that i can not even listen to them . the song selection is very disorganized . the instrumentation is terrible . the production is so bad that it is hard to believe that it wa made in 2006. the lyric are so atrocious . the melody are just plain bad . all in all , i find it hard to listen to this album without thinking about how much bad music it is . and all because of the fact that the recording is so terrible .
0	this is one of my favorite piece . i have this cd in my car . i play it when i drive .
0	this wa my first reo speedwagon album , and i like it . i liked the country song , but i liked the bluesy song , too . some of the song are very well written , and some are not . i would buy this album again .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	she is so talented .
0	i saw this movie when i wa twelve . i had no idea that i would love it or what i would love about it . i wa also not aware that i would be a fan of the beatles . i wa in awe of the music .
1	i have never heard bonnie raitt sing better than she did on this . the overall quality of her music is great . this is a must have album .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i love this album . it is one of my favorite album in existence . i love their early stuff , the song they did during their first four album , and this album is just like their early stuff . the song are a good a any other dave clark five album .
0	this album ha some really great song . i really enjoy the sound quality of this album . the sound are really good and the lyric are good . this album is really good , but i do not think it is worth the price .
1	i have listened to a lot of worship album in the past , and i have yet to find an album that give me the spiritual satisfaction that i got on this album . the only thing that really bothered me a bit wa the lack of creativity on the song writing . i wa really impressed with the production , and the energy of the song . i wa hoping for a more upbeat , le smooth , a little more soulful , and a lot more personal .
0	i love listening to this song but the video is not so great .
1	is anyone else tired of this song ? i love this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is the best song i have ever heard ! i like this song ! it is awesome . i love this song ! this is one of my favorite song . this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i love this song . this is one of the best song i have ever heard !
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i thought this wa a great album . i agree with the comment , there is nothing on here worth listening to . i tried to pick some favorite and the selection were all so far removed from each other , i could not make a judgement of any of the song until i heard them all . i did however pick up the end of the world is nigh which i had not heard before .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	what an amazing , fantastic , and moving album ! great song selection , beautiful lyric , and powerful vocal . this is one of my all time favorite album and i have heard and purchased many of his album . i love his music and i love him . this is no exception .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i am an artiste . i am not a singer . i can sing , i just can not sing well . this is my first album that i have written . i am not a singer anyway . i would never sing in public . i have never had a singing moment . i have always been a song writer first . i have never sung in a public setting . i wrote all of the song . the only thing i could do with it would be to upload it to youtube and post the video . i want to use the video a a marketing tool to promote my brand . i love the video .
0	i wa first introduced to this song when i wa around ten year old . i actually thought it wa by r & b diva , but i do not know which one . i have never heard it before , so this is probably a first .
1	i love the album , but i think it is a little overpriced .
0	i have heard a lot of people say that this is a great cd , but i have never really heard anyone say that this is a great cd .
0	i love this album . the music is enjoyable , you can find yourself humming tune like it is your own .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i have heard this song countless time at wedding ceremony , funeral , and special occasion too . it just get me in the mood to celebrate .
1	i thought this album wa very good . it wa a good mix of style . i wa surprised to hear this new version . there is no doubt that this is an amazing album , and i recommend it .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is a great album . i love the
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i wa really surprised by how much i liked this song . i do not think it really did anything for me in term of being a song . it did however , help me get through the day .
0	lost being
0	i like this song , it is just too long . what is the point of having this song and then making it to the point where it is to long ? i dont want to have to listen to this song all the way through . it not even a song by miley cyrus at all ! it is like she is reading a book or something .
1	tom scott - jazz-
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i love to read and learn about your product , i have been a fan of amazon for a long time and i have never bought anything from you other than your book and i have enjoyed reading all of them . this wa a great product and i am pleased to recommend it to my friend .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do recall him .
0	one of the best record i have ever heard . this is a great album of all different type of music . the song blend together well a a whole .
0	the beginning is very good . then , just a the song get going , the guitar solo start . it is very boring , and it really take away from the song . the end is great though and i give it a 5 star rating .
0	the original is so much better . i love this song . the movie is so much better . this song suck .
0	this is pretty cool , but i wish it wa better .
1	this is one of my favorite album of all time .
1	this is my first time with the band . i have heard a few of their song , but this is the first time i have heard them play live . the sound is fantastic . they have a very powerful voice . they definitely know how to play fast and rock hard . the music is simple yet very powerful . i would say this is a must own for any metal fan .
1	this is an awesome song . i am glad i have it .
1	i think that this album is the best trance album so far . i like this album a lot and i think that it is just good .
1	this collection is great .
0	this song is so boring . i have heard it so many time . i do not know why it keep giving me the creep . i am not even sure what it is about . it is not very exciting or fun . i just do not like it .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	all of the song i have heard so far are incredible . the music is so beautiful and the vocal are amazing . i find it impossible to put down my headphone while listening to the song . the best part is that it seems to get better and better a you listen to it . i can not wait for the next album to be out .
0	i love the original it is a wonderful life , and i love the way the melody is added to the song . i love the way the melody flow through the verse and the chorus , and the way it roll into the chorus . the melody just flow easily , and this is an easy song to sing . this is the song i will always listen to when i want to hear a christmas song with a happy ending , like this one .
1	this song wa on tom wait first cd , which came out in 1996. it is not a bad song but i thought it wa a little cheesy . my wife wa very positive about this song . this is just a positive a it get . it ha a great melody and a great instrumentation . it ha a very nice chorus .
0	this is another great album which is really hard to describe . to me , it is a mixture of different style and genre , and it is very diverse . so much so that i wa not sure what to say about it . even though i really liked it , i am just not convinced that they should have released it a a 2-disc set .
1	i believe this is the first one that i have written on a song . thank you for the opportunity .
1	this song ha a good message . it is a good song , and i like it . i think the video is nice , but i am not sure if it is appropriate for an advertising campaign .
1	larein is the most consistent and most amazing band on the internet . their live show are the best of any band i have seen and hear , period !
1	this is a very good live album . i really enjoy listening to live album and this one is a good one the song are mostly good . it is not a very long album but it would be fine for a one track cd player .
1	my husband hate this song . i love it . i can not seem to find the music to this song . is it the same a this or is it different ? i love it .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this is the song i play when i have problem . i have never watched the video but i hear that it is really dark .
1	i think this album is a great whitney houston album . i have been a whitney houston fan since i first heard her on the ed sullivan show . i think this album is the best whitney houston album by far . i can listen to this album for hour !
1	fantastic song .
1	it is good , it is a good song .
0	great album full of great music and good arrangement .
1	i have had this cd for a while and find it quite enjoyable . it is clear , easy to listen to and easy to play .

1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	i like the way the vocal sound .
1	this album is an amazing album . i have been listening to this band for several year and this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i will recommend this to everyone i know ! i really enjoy this album .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i love this song , and i think it is a really good song . this song is great . i like it . i have it in the car with me on drive time . the only reason i do not rate this song is because i like sam sparros black and gold album , and this is not that album . i would rate it a 4.5/5 .
1	i love this one , but the song is a little overproduced .
1	i am a fan of jazz , and i enjoy listening to this jazz album . the song are all different and have interesting lyric . i like the sound the guitar play and the bass sound . i like the song that have interesting lyric .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	if you do not have a window phone , this song is not for you .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i love this so much ! i love everything about it , especially the guitar ! i wish i could sing it !
1	i love my beatles .
1	this is an old favorite song , and i love it .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i wa very surprised by the quality of this album .
0	i know nothing about this artist . i am not even sure if i should listen to this or not . i will be listening to it in the car while i am driving .
0	the music wa perfect . but the lyric were awkward . they really did not have any place in the movie .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	i bought uptown funk because i wa looking for a more commercial prince record , and i wa disappointed . uptown funk is a good collection of song , but some of it is a bit too similar for my taste . i prefer the more varied sound of prince album , and this is not one of them .
1	very good album . it is definitely prince , but it is not the prince i remember .
1	this album is excellent . it ha a great mix of worship song .
0	her voice is so beautiful , but the quality is terrible . i would have prefered the cd had it been good .
1	i have been a fan of this band for many year and i am a huge fan of it right now .
1	this song wa on the i want to hold your hand cd and i wa a big fan of the song i want to hold your hand . this song ha a great beat to it and a great message . i thank god for the opportunity to have heard this song .
0	i love that song , but the video is horrible .
1	this
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	i really like this cd . it is very different , and that is what i like about it . it wa not my favorite cd , but i still like it . i think that the music is very interesting , and i like how the vocal are different . it is definitely very good for people who like to listen to a lot of different music .
0	a few song on this cd were ok , but the rest wa not very good .
1	i really love this song . it reminds me of a cool , funky version of this tune by the rolling stone .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i thought this album wa great . it is a very good album .
1	i saw it on my wall today and i wa blown away ! i have never heard a song that really made me feel the way this did , and i wanted to cry . i feel inspired by this song !
1	this band is so awesome , they have some really good song and they have a great sound .
0	this is a very interesting album . i have not listened to it enough , but the song seem to be very personal . hasselvander make some good point a well . i have not listened to this album enough to make a good assessment of it . i did however have a friend , who is very much into the big band music , and she told me that this album is not for her .
1	i love her music ! it is great !
1	i love the song , the voice are awesome , i do not know what this song is .
1	this compilation is great ! i have heard a number of song on this compilation . each song is so well written and sung .
0	this is a really good album that is worth the money . i love the album . i have loved every album by this band . i think this is one of my all time favorite .
1	i really like her .
0	i wa really hoping to like this cd , but i did not . i am a huge jazz fan and this cd is not jazz , it is more like a crappy jazz album . the only reason i gave it a 4 star rating is because it is a cd that is in the jazz genre . it is hard to believe that this album is called her album . it is not hip-hop , soul , or blue . it ha a lot of hip-hop and soul music . i hope that this cd can be re-released with her name on the cover .

0	the way it wa delivered wa very disappointing and i had to go to other site to find it . it wa extremely slow to download . no one is even interested in this song . i have a feeling the disc is cursed and will never come out for me to listen to . it is one of the worst one i have ever downloaded .

0	i am very impressed with this album . she is got a great voice and i like her .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this album is amazing . i love all the song on it . i love the song my heart . i love all of the song in it . i love the message behind all of it . this album will make you feel better and if you listen to the whole album it will make you feel better .

1	i think this song is awesome . it is very catchy and fun , and i really like the guitar riff . i have it on my ipod and listen to it when i am driving to and from work .
1	this song made my day and i am very happy .
0	my daughter really enjoyed this song , but wa disappointed that it wa not a christmas song .
0	i bought two copy of this cd , the first one wa for a friend and the cd wa free , the second one wa for me . my friend really liked the first cd , it wa like a thank you after the concert . i got the cd a a gift for myself . the quality of the cd is great but the only song i really like is bless me by the beatles and i do not know why i did not like the other song . all i can say is i did not buy it and will probably never buy another one .

1	my favorite of 2001 !
0	i bought this for my niece and nephew , age 8 and 6 - they loved it , it wa fun to play this through the stereo . i guess i liked it better than the music i have played them . i think i will stick with the music . there are a few part that i could have cut out , but i am not sure what it is i am missing . i guess i could have put a little more punch in the first verse , but what do i know ? i am sure it is just a simple error on my part . i think they enjoyed it just fine , they liked the music . the only thing i would have done differently would have used a brighter screen on my computer .
0	i have downloaded this album several time . it is very disappointing ( if you need a recommendation for a bad album , go for this one . ) the vocal are horrible . the song are generic and repetitive . the only redeeming feature is that it wa the first album by the new band . that said , i still would not buy it .

1	this is the first cd i have ever purchased . i bought it because it wa offered on sale for $ 0.00 . i am not a huge fan of prince but i love his music . i also enjoy watching him perform and he is an amazing singer . i wa glad she recorded this song . i enjoyed listening to it . i think it is a good cd for people who are not big fan of prince , but like his music . i wish she would have put the song on a cd album and sold it for $ 0.00 . i think she should of done it , but i am glad she did it in a series . i thought the song wa well done .

0	haha , this is one of my top song ever ! never heard it before either ! i wish i could buy the original version . but i can only buy this one .
1	a the title suggests , this is another one of the new album from the late great jan garbarek . i wa expecting something more in the classical vein , and wa not disappointed . his vocal are very nice , and the instrumental playing is very good , if not quite up to scratch . he ha a new album out with nonesuch record , and it is worth picking up - i am sure i will have a listen to the cd before i make my final decision .

1	awesome ! this is one of the best christian album of all time . i play it all the time .
1	a nice clean version
1	this is a wonderful cd of music from the beach boy . i am glad i finally had the money to afford this . this is my favorite cd of the beach boy . the cover is great and the inside is great . this is the best one i have ever purchased , i have a great collection of cd . i love being able to buy rare collection of music .
1	i bought this album for my boyfriend . he love this album .
0	the song is a bit bland . i like the melody and the lyric very much . but , the song is boring . it is very predictable and it doe not really have any great stand out moment .
0	the only cd that i have received in a cracked case wa the first one , the cd wa fine , just opened it up and it wa fine . the 2nd cd wa in a cracked case and the case wa cracked a well . i will be returning this cd in a cracked case a well . the second cd wa not a good a the first one . i would recommend for anyone to put the cd in a cd case .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i really like this cd , it is a really fun cd to dance to . the song are all different . i have not listened too much to this cd . i do like it .
0	good song , if you like this song please give it a try , it is very good
0	this album is from a band that i like , but i do not have it on my ipod . i would like to hear it , but i can not find it in the itunes store . is there any way you could get me a copy of this album ? i would like to get it for christmas .
1	although the cover art a bit boring , i like the song on this cd . it is a cd i have heard before , and i like it . i have heard this cd before , so i like it .
0	i bought her last album , and it is my favorite . i have been buying this for a year and a half , and i have loved it every time . i think she should keep the same style , but improve it a lot . i just do not understand why she started changing it up . i do not know if the album is good .
1	this is an excellent song and i think it one of the best on the album . the music ha a nice old school style and the music is a little more mellow than most song in the album .
0	i love the bluesy playing on this cd . but it is a shame that there are no guitar solo or any other instrumental track on this album . it would have been nice to hear a little more variety in the instrumental music . and i wa really surprised to find out that the song this is not a song for the noun is actually in 3/4 time and not 4/4 . i am sure there is a mistake in the book , but i like the song better in 1/4 . the other two song are both upbeat and have a nice rhythm to them . but at the end of the day , this is a cd for the blue .
0	i can not stand this album . i wanted to buy it but i do not like it .
0	the song are all good , but the song sound very , very , very poor .
1	i like sam sparros black and gold enough to want to have a many cd a possible .
0	the singer are bad . they sound like they are from a radio show . i do not care for music .
1	this is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . the song is so well written , i feel like i am listening to a movie soundtrack , in a good way . the vocal are sweet and the piano playing is superb .
0	the whole song is fine . i am happy to be able to listen to this .
0	very nice cd .
1	i have listened to this album a lot . i have played it over and over . i like the song . but i do not like the band . i have heard this band before , but i have never heard it like this . the band sound very old school . they sound like they are playing a song from a 70 tv show . they are very old and very conservative . the band is called the big lebowski and they are from houston . the band is very good . the band ha been around since the 90 . it ha a lot of energy and a lot of fun . i have really liked all their album so far . the band ha been around since the 90 . i have only heard the first album called the big lebowski . the band ha not released anything else since then . but i really like the band . the band ha a lot of energy and a lot of fun . i have heard the song on the first album and the song on the cd of this album . i really like the first cd . the song on this cd are great . the song sound great . the band sound very good . the band is very good . it is a lot of fun . the music is different from the cd i had before . the band sound old . but it is a lot of fun .
1	i love this song ! i love this song ! i love this song . i love this song ! i love this song !
0	i like the first part much more than the second part . it is still good . but then the voice start , i do not really like them .
1	this album is incredible ! it is perfect for fan of old school rnb . it is just that all the song are so bad . there is actually a song called i want to be with you which is so bad .
1	i do not usually like christmas song , but this one wa so catchy that i really enjoyed it . i hope she will write more song like this . i really enjoyed this .
0	i like the song but not the lyric .
0	this is an interesting album . i have many of the song but not the order i prefer . i would recommend a few on the album i would not recommend others on other track . some of the track are like song you want to hear but not others . i agree with the song i want you to know that the music make you want to listen to the whole album . i have no idea what the story is about . i am not even sure the lyric are real . i feel like this is a collection of song that do not have a real story . i just feel that way . the song are good but could you get the album and put the song in the order i like them in ? there had better be some song with a positive message . i can not listen to i just wanted to love you and when doe life start at the same time .
1	i just love this song ! it is so catchy and fun to dance to , i love how it ha a happy ending . i can not wait to hear more by this talented singer .
0	i love a very special christmas but i would have preferred a very special love song .
1	love this band .
1	i really really like this album , and i am really glad i got it . i wa really sad when i found out that david lee roth had passed away . i have been listening to his album since i have been a kid . i think this album is better than the first one because i like the production and i like david lee roth when he is singing . i think this is one of the best album of 2004. it is a great album .
0	this album is very hard to listen to . i could not stay up .
1	this song just ha the right amount of energy to it .
1	i love this song and i love the cover art . it is an old classic that seems to be everywhere . the song is very cool and i love it . i do not know what i think of the vocal .
0	i have always loved this album , and have bought it every christmas since the album wa released . i have only been able to purchase it on my ipod , and it is now on my car stereo . it is a great and classic album . please get it to me .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i really love this song . it is a great song . i love the song and the beat .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i think it is great . the best kelly clarkson album i have ever heard .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this is a great song . the lyric are very clever and catchy . i am enjoying the whole album . but i think if you do not like him personally you will not enjoy his music .
1	i love the song .
0	i wish i had listened to this album when i wa 13. i am 22 now , and i can not believe that it took me this long to discover this album . i am now listening to it in my car , and it is great .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	this is a great song . it is a song that make me think about my friend , my family , and being a young adult . this song ha always made me cry . i am glad i found this song .
1	i wa really surprised by how good this album is . it is got a lot of energy , a lot of energy . i think this album is amazing .
0	i really enjoy brandy .
0	this song is nice . it is a cover band . i will check out the next song .
1	it is the best jazz album i have ever heard
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . it is not often that an album is so complete . the cd is very well made and play well . very well worth the price . i have owned this album for a year and have listened to it a lot . i think this is the best album of his i have heard .
1	this is a really good cd . it ha a lot of great song and a lot good musician . it is a really good cd . but it is too short and i would like to have had more song . all song are fantastic , but i think the cd could have had a few le song . i am going to buy a new cd and this is great for the money . i would recommend this cd to a friend and buy it again when i have more money . it is worth buying . it is a good cd . i would recommend it to a friend .
0	i wa happy to hear this song
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	great album . it ha a real story behind it . the vocal are great . the song on this album are great . i will buy this album .
0	i have listened to this song like 20 time and i like it . the lyric make me feel like one of my church friend . it is just a great song and i like it . it really make you feel like you are in church . it is just a great song . i also like the original more . the movie is better . the original is even better .
1	a great mix of a variety of genre . i love the mix of sound that they have , and the fact that they are so diverse and different from each other is what make this album great . the band is really good at just being themselves , and not trying to fit in with any other band . this album is great , and for all those that are not familiar with them , i would suggest that you go out and download this album , and when you go to itunes , you may want to purchase this album , because you just might end up liking it .
1	this cd give you the same thing a lot of them do , and that is different . this cd allows you to choose your own mood and have an experience that you will remember for a long time . i have not listened to any of the song on this cd yet , but i have heard them all . they are all great . it is hard to choose my favorite , but the one i love the most are no more tear and i do not need you .
1	i have listened to your cd and i am very impressed . i have many of your cd and they are excellent .
1	i like the way the song on this cd are arranged . it is simple and very relaxing . the vocal do not get in my way and the instrumentals compliment the vocal very well . i like the way it ha a nice bluesy feel to it . if you like a bluesy feel this would be a good starting point .
1	wonderful album . i listen to it most day .
0	excellent ! this is a very good compilation of trance music . it is well done , and the track are very well done . i like the mix of trance track on this album . this is not a greatest hit album , this is a complete album . the mix is fantastic on all the track . this is a great compilation of trance music .
0	barbras voice is amazing .
0	this is a great collection of song . i really liked the song . i really liked the way that the song were arranged .
1	i love this song . the lyric are very clever and clever . the song is very catchy .
1	this song is a little bit different from the other song i have heard of this band . it is just so good . i can see myself singing this to my child . it is a great song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i love that this song is so good for my soul , for my heart . i love the message , the lyric and the beat .
1	this song is amazing ! this is a good song , but it is not a classic like rock you like a hurricane and i want your sex . it is not a classic like rock you like a hurricane and the end of the world . it ha a good beat , a good chorus , a good melody , and it ha good lyric . i love this song ! it is a good song . this is my favorite song on the album . it ha a good chorus , it ha interesting lyric , and it ha a good melody . this is a great song . it is a very catchy song . i like this song . it ha a good beat , it ha a good chorus , it ha interesting lyric , and it ha a nice melody . this is a great song . i like this song . this is a really fun song . it ha a good beat , it ha a good chorus and it ha good lyric . this is a really great song ! it ha a good chorus , it ha good lyric , and it ha a good melody . this is a really great song . this is a great song . this is a really great song . this is a really great song . this is one of my favorite song . i like this song . it is a pretty good song . this is a good song . this is a good song . this is an amazing song !
1	i have only just begun to listen to the cd . i love it .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is a very happy song . i like it all the time !
0	i like the album . it ha a good flow . not great , but good .
1	i am glad i bought this cd . i like the music
0	this is not a bad cover at all . it seems to be a good representation of the band sound . the lyric make it a little more interesting , but probably not worth the price . the song is pretty cool . if you like punk rock , it would be worth a listen .
1	i love this song . i think it is one of the best song of the year . i bought the cd in 1999 , and even though it took me a few year to get it , i always thought it would be a hit . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard the song played on a radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio today , i could not believe it . i really love it . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard it played on a radio . so when i saw it come up on the station today , i wa like ohhhhhh and put it on my cd . very excited .
0	this is a terrible album . it is a big disappointment . it is just boring . i like the song the greatest show on earth . it is a decent song . i bought the cd because i like the band . i want to like the dave clark five . but , this is not good . if you like the dave clark five , do not buy this cd . not worth it .
1	this song is extremely catchy and addictive . it is very easy to sing along to . the song is very good and i like it a lot . the lyric are also very good . in fact , the best lyric i have ever heard .
0	i am really liking this album and this song is great .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	it is a good album to start off with . this album is a good album to start off with .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	great album . i think it just need a little more songwriting and performance in the song i did not like , but other than that , a great album .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i love the arrangement
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .

0	i really enjoy this album . it is my favorite album of the year .
1	this is
1	i really like the sound and the texture on this song . i like the sound of the bell and the drumming . it is a very nice little composition .
1	this wa the first song i bought on itunes , and it is the one i still use most often . i love it simplicity , and i love the way it is not so structured and not so pretty that it get boring .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	the vocal are on the edge a bit and the band seems a little uncertain of where they want to go with the song . the song is also a little bit too long for it own good .
1	i am glad i bought this album
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	it is a very good song .
1	this song ha a great beat and sound .
1	the dave clark five ha released a great collection . this album is very interesting . it ha good song , which really make it to the cd . i am excited to get to the other dave clark five song on the cd . i really like this cd .
0	i have yet to hear this album , but i have heard it on several occasion . i think it is very good . i would recommend this to anybody who like jazz . it is very good . i would recommend this to everybody .
0	i can not help myself . i first heard this album in the mid-eighties . i wa so enamored with the raw , raw playing that i purchased the rest of the album on the same day .
1	this is a great cd . the song are great , and the band is great . the music is great , and the lyric are great . this is a great cd , and i am very surprised at how much i liked this cd .
1	i love this cd , it is all about the music , it is all about the lyric , it is all about the music , it is all about the lyric . just listen to this cd and you will like it .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i love the original song by e.s.posthumus , but this version is much more impressive . the song on this cd are beautiful , and they sound great .
0	if you think that you do not like tom wait , then you have not heard him live . this is the first tom wait album i have had . it is more like a live recording than an album and is a very good live album . it wa recorded at a live concert . the sound quality is superb but i do not have the cd player to listen to it .
1	i love barbra streisand . she is my favorite .
1	i bought this cd a a present for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it . the only thing that wa difficult wa getting it to stay in it case , but after some reading on amazon and elsewhere , i figured out how to do it fairly easily .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	love this song very much . it is so sad and yet so happy . this is a great song .
0	not bad , i like it . the song love is okay , but the other song are pretty bad .
0	i have been searching for a good-quality copy of this album for several year now . the music is a little thin , but i can live with it . it is also a very well-produced album . the album is also quite expensive ( especially the vinyl ) which doe not make sense , considering that the entire album wa produced in a very short period of time ( le than three year ) .
0	i love this song . i love the movie version , too .
1	the song in this album are very good and the singer is wonderful . i listen to this a lot .
0	i love this album . i love the music , the lyric , and the album . i love the album and i love the album . i have been listening to this album for year . i have loved this album since i could remember . i love the album . i love the album . i love the album and i love the album .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i really like this cd and i would not give it a bad review . i like the song on the cd . it is a good cd with good song .
1	i love it .
1	i have listened to this cd several time now . the song are well performed and the album is well put together . i have yet to hear a bad song on the cd .
1	this is a very good sounding tape . unfortunately ive been very lucky with this site so far , and i dont know if this is a good or bad sign for the future of the site . all the song are good ive been listening to everything you guy release . i dont know if this is a good or bad sign . im gon na give this tape a 1 star . i am very happy with the cd quality and the sound of it . i would have preferred a more solid sounding tape , maybe a little more treble , but thats to be expected from a tape . the only thing that is annoying is that the song the best ever always start at around the 4minute mark . i have to leave it at a 1 star rating because i have to leave the site to go to work . i will be back around 5am on the 2nd to listen to what you guy have in store for me . thanks .
0	it wa good but she isnt the best and it annoying , ive always liked her music but i had to listen to this all the time and it getting on my nerve
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i like this song but i do not know what the meaning is . i do not know why or where i heard the song . the song is fun and energetic but i do not know if it is a good song or not . the song is ok .
1	if you do not know the lyric to this song , you need to stop reading this review . it is not my fault . i wa trying to tell you what a great song this is . i wa listening to reo speedwagon , and i heard a song on the radio that said i can not quit you . i wa so disappointed in myself for not knowing the lyric . i quickly looked it up on my computer and found the lyric . i wa elated when i found out that the voice is john frusciante . when i listened to the song , the music and the lyric were just a perfect match . i wa completely amazed by how this song wa written . it wa so creative and so well written . i wa really amazed that john wrote this song ; it wa just perfect for the song that it wa . now i know why everyone is saying that i can not quit you . if it wa a man , i would have quit you a long time ago .
1	i have always loved the music of george gershwin . i have heard of many recording of him and have never heard one that ha the complete work of gershwin . this is my first time doing gershwin . i am amazed at how
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i like this song . i think it is a very good song . i do not think it is a good song . it is not a very good song . it is not a very good song . it just doe not cut it . it is a very good song .
0	i have been to a couple of concert with the local orchestra and i agree with someone above , it is not that good . i agree with the others that this is not a cd for the choir , but for those who are not choir people .
1	this is a very cool dvd .
1	i love this band . i love the song , i love the way it is played and i love the music . i love the fact that they were able to write and record so many song in such a short time . this album is a great album . they could have recorded it in a month and it would have been an awesome album . it is a great album , and i hope it sell well . we live in a great country and this album is a great way to show the world they can have a band like this .
1	i picked out a copy of i saw her standing there from this cd . i am a big fan of the rolling stone . this song is definitely a classic . i love the sound quality , the song is great , and the lyric are really powerful .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had gotten it sooner . this album is great but i do not know if it is the masterpiece . it is a great album , but it is not my favorite album .
1	i love this version .
0	she ha the best voice of the singer i found , and her song are very good .
1	awesome ! i listened to it while my husband wa watching a movie , and i can not tell you how good it made me feel . i would love to have more of her stuff .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this is the best radio show i have heard in a long time !
0	i like this song . it is fast and fun . i am surprised i have not heard it on the radio .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	the original is so much better . this is terrible .
0	i do not like the song or the cover , i do not really like her either . the song itself is average . i do not get the feeling she is singing about the love between her and her husband . i do not think she ever mention him in the song . the piano part is good , the backing voice is weak and she sings very quiet . the bridge is good , but i do not like the repetition of the line . it is good to have a song that is repeated twice , but it is not like the song is played 2 billion time . the cover is nice , but i think she is not singing about the love between her and her husband .
1	this is not a classical christmas album , but it is an album that is suitable for christian use .
0	i like this song , but only on the album , not on the single , which is the version i have . it is a pretty good song , but i can not stand it when it get too loud . i think it is because of the singing , which i do not really like , but i do not know . i have it on my mp3 player , but i do not have the cd .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	this is the end of your idol career . and i had to say so . i am so disappointed . this wa a great idol experience . i have been waiting for her to release another cd .
1	this is my favorite song on the cd . it is very relaxing . i always sleep to this song .
1	i love the song and the video . it make me feel very warm and comfortable . i love the way she sings . it is so nice to listen to .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	it go fast
0	i wa surprised at how good this one wa . i wa hoping that the song would be more like the rest of her repertoire . it is so different from what i have heard , and i have to say , i really like it . it is just one of those song that you can not put down .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i have had this cd for a couple of week and have enjoyed it very much . i thought it wa the best cd i had ever heard . i have listened to it a total of 26 time and each time i have heard a new song i have had a better impression of this cd . i am not sure what i am going to do with it , but i will try and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and ever again . this cd is very long , but i really love it . i would just give this cd high rating .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	not a bad song , but not for me . i hate being forced to listen to music by other people . i dont care if theyre good or not . and the lyric are inane , just like the video . it a boring song .
1	i am a newbie to the site but this is the first cd i have purchased that ha made me feel relaxed . i like to listen to my cd whenever i am down and not to listen to the same old song that i have already bought .
1	just another great song from allan bole , i really like it .
0	i have also heard this song before in the new version . is a nice song .
1	i had the pleasure of having this new cd in my collection a few week ago . i really love it . i bought it because it wa on sale . it is a good cd with a mix of contemporary and old-school song . it ha great lyric and great melody . i really like the song that are about worship . they are good for worship music . i like the song that are slow and quiet , but they do not have the wow factor . i really like the song that are upbeat , but they do not stand out a much . i guess that is just the way it go . i think this cd is good , but i think i will buy it again .
0	she is one of the singer for the band folk implosion on the myspace.com . she ha a great voice , but the song doe not do it justice . still , good song .
0	i grew up listening to the beatles , and i wa disappointed when i found out that this album wa recorded in 1964. i thought it wa from the 60 .
1	this album is excellent !
1	this is a great album , i agree . i like the album a lot .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	so , this is new . it is a really good cd . i love the song ! you can not hear this cd on low . it will make you go crazy . i like the song , but i would like to have had more song . i am going to buy a new cd and this should make it . i am going to buy a new cd and this will be the cd i will listen to . thanks for the cd .
0	i am really sorry to say this but this album is a waste of time . i do not know why i even bothered .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this is not a good song at all . i do not think it deserves any rating at all . the video is just plain ugly and boring .
0	this is a bit of a strange song . it is kind of like a little country song , but with a lot of different element . the instrumentation keep you engaged , but the lyric are just not very good .
0	i am just a little disappointed , but i have to say that i still love the band and i am happy they have released this cd . i have several copy of it and i only listen to it at random . it is just some of the greatest music ever .
1	this is a great cd . i am glad i bought it . i have learned a lot of song . i will probably buy more thing from amazon . i have always been satisfied with my purchase from amazon . in fact , i have never had a bad experience at amazon .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i just discovered this cd . i will listen to it again and again !
0	this is a good album , but it ha a little bit repetitive to it . it ha a good variety of melody , and that is what i like to hear in a cd . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good , well-done mix of trance .
0	this song rock my world .
1	it is a great collection of oldie . i really enjoyed it .
0	i have no idea what to say about this one . i do not know if i am going to like it or not . i like this genre of music , but i do not like the lyric . i do not really have any real negative thought about it . i hope i like it !
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	i love this one . but i think it could be a little bit longer .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	it is a nice collection of song . it is good , but not great .
1	i like a lot of the song from
1	this is not my favorite song on the cd , but it is really good , i have been listening to it a lot lately , and when i get around to buying another copy , i know i am going to be buying it !
0	it is a fun song to listen to in the car . - - - - - -
1	the song make me cry . it make me cry . it tear me up . this is a great song .
1	the song rise up is the most personal sounding song he ha created yet , and it is a total departure from his usual sound . the sound and sound of jps guitar playing is unique and powerful . the lyric are very personal , and i think they really connect with people .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	love this album . this album is awesome .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this is a great album . the best in term of music i have ever heard . i love this album .
1	this is a good song .
1	i wa looking for new and exciting at about $ 13.99 and this wa it . i bought it because it wa $ 14.99 and it wa not new and exciting . i bought it ( it wa a gift for my son ) . so i have no idea what wa going on . i have not seen the show ( it wa in chicago ) or the artist . maybe it wa a performance or maybe he wa not the artist and he came to the show a a stand in . i have written a review about it which i am submitting for review . i am very disappointed in how much that the artist is charging for this piece . who doe he think he is , i mean who doe he think he is ? he is not the artist . he is not even the artist !
0	this is a good show , but it is nothing special . it is a radio show with a host , and some guest and a few interview . it is a good radio show , but not a great one .
1	for some reason i wa really bored with this song and this album a a whole . i wa hoping for a real good song and an even better album to come from this band . i guess all i can say is that i like the song . it is good . it is an average song but it is still good .
0	i really like this cd . the album is called the new pornographer & friend : live in amsterdam and feature a cd of various track recorded live at a public concert . this is a live cd , and i really like it . it wa definitely a lot of fun to listen to . maybe i am just a sucker for live music .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this is just a fun song . i like it .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i do not know if she is still alive , but i do know that she did this album . it sound like her . i would love to hear her live .

1	this album is so good , i think it is better than the previous album . i love it !
0	this is the most overplayed song on the radio . i like the first verse , but the whole chorus is boring and annoying . but the chorus is catchy .
1	this is a great song , and i really appreciate the uniqueness of the lyric and melody .
0	she doe not sing all the time like she did on the last album ; however , she doe the vocal better here .
0	this cd is worth the price , highly recommended for any fan of the dave clark five .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i have never found a song i liked so much !
0	i love this album . i will definitely buy it again in the future .
0	i like it .
0	i liked this song . the only problem is that it is so short . i am glad i bought it because it wa a nice change from the usual rock song on this cd .

1	this album will be one of my favorite .

1	i purchased this album a a gift for my husband . i am a worship leader , so i like to encourage my worship team and they all like this album . i especially like the song that are encouraging and uplifting . i would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a worship album that is uplifting and encouraging .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this is the third cd i have purchased from amazon . i am a fan of the dave clark five . the first two cd , i purchased because i love the music and the first two cd , i purchased because i love the band . i am a fan of their music . i like their music . i like their song . i like their sound . i like their music . i like their music . i like their music . they are my favorite group , but this cd is awful .
1	i would like to buy this cd but i will not be able to because i do not have the money .
0	i found this song to be a good song , but i do not like the ending of the song .
0	i can not wait to go to this concert . i need to go . the band is awesome and the venue is great . it is definitely worth going to .
1	i have listened to this album a lot in the last few week . it is great !
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	very nice album ! i bought the old one . love the new one .
0	this is a good song , but not a great song . i can not believe that the singer can sing the song . i have heard him sing it twice , and i can not believe he can sing it . it is just one of those song that you sing and people think you are a good singer . but you can not sing it . and you can not even sing it well . the only thing you can do with it is that you can sing it to yourself or sing it to your friend . the only good thing about this song is that the guitar sound good .
1	i know this is a strange album , but i love it . i think it is one of the top 10 or 15 of all time . the lyric are very powerful , the music ha a great groove to it , and i like the way the production is done . i am really glad david lee roth wa still making album after he died .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	this is one of the best live rock song i have heard . i have seen the dave clark five a lot . the band ha been around for a long time . there are so many great song on this cd . this is one of their best . i have always enjoyed their music . i like alot of their song . this is their best . i would not change a thing about the song . the music is great . the playing is great . the vocal are great . you can really hear the emotion in the song . i love the song . i love the song ! i love this song ! i love this song ! i love this song !

1	this song really help me to get through the day . it is a great song and i have been married to my husband for 12 year .
0	i would like to have a cd of this song , but i am not sure it would be the same . i am glad i am not the only person that think this . i know my ear have been accustomed to the volume . i had to turn it up to hear it . i can not say for sure if my ear have adjusted to the higher volume but i would like a cd of this song . my favorite is the way the music flow from one song to the next . i like the way the song go from country to rock and roll and back to country again . i am not sure if it is the same song because i have not listened to it in a long time . i am very sorry that i will not be able to listen to the audio of the song you sent me . i am happy that you are able to listen to the song at the same volume that i am . i would like to know when the cd of the song you sent me will be coming . when the cd of the song will be available i will let you know .

0	it is an okay song , but i like the rest of the album and this song is just a little nothin .
0	i really like this album . i would recommend this to people who like prince . this is definitely one of his best album .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	she is a gifted singer . i like her singing .
0	i just wanted to say i am a big fan of dave clark and his music . i have had a cd copy of the dave clark five for a while now . i wa just listening to a cover version i like , and i thought what a great idea to have a dave clark five track on the cd . i have had a cd copy for a few month now and i am very excited to listen to the cd .
1	this is the best of the three album i have ever purchased . i have been a long time fan of the band . i saw them 10 year ago , and i have listened to them since then . i saw them in concert at the beginning of this year . their sound is so fresh and modern . the sound on this album is really amazing , and i will be buying the other two album a well .
1	“ it is the music of my soul . i am thankful to god for bringing me to the place where i can appreciate music and appreciate my own voice. ” i like this music . it is not easy to write lyric to music but i know the effort and time it take to write lyric to music that is of great beauty . the lyric in this music are meaningful and meaningful to me . i love this music .

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this album is a good album , but i had to force myself to listen to it . i wa not too pleased with it . the album i already have is at least better .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this recording is the best i have ever heard . i can not believe that these people have been in the music industry for so long before they recorded an album like this . i am always amazed at the talent that these young people , who are obviously very talented , posse .
0	i do not mind the lyric , but the music is just not that great .
1	this is one of my favorite . it is the best album that i have ever heard by a christian artist . they play the song that i like , and they are good song and well performed . the album ha a lot of worship and praise song . it is very spiritual and uplifting . this is a must have album for any christian . i wa born again several year after listening to this album .

0	this is an awesome song .
1	i really enjoy it . i am glad i bought it .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	a great song , though i have to admit , i have found the movie version to be superior - although both version are great .
1	i am not a music critic but this is a collection of song which is worth buying . it is a beautiful collection of song .
0	i am not a fan of the beatles . i liked the original album and liked the concert , but i hated the song get back ( from the first album ) . this is by far the worst of all their album . the only good thing is that the vocal are good and the harmony are great . the rest is just annoying . i did like the intro of i want to hold your hand very much . the next track , i have just seen a face , is also good . love me do is by far the best track . the only good thing about this album is that the music is extremely varied and it ha a good amount of good song .
1	the cd is really good . it is fun to listen to and ha good music . the message is really positive and the song on the cd are really good . the cd is really well produced . i am really looking forward to listening to the whole cd .
0	i thought this wa going to be a great album . i thought it would be a great album . i thought this would be a great album .
0	this album ha a killer hook , but i do not like the whole song . robert
1	the first album is amazing .
1	i am not an avid fan of it because it wa just an ordinary song from the album but i love the lyric and i love the song .
1	this song ha some very nice harmonica part . i like the way they do it . i like that it doe not sound like country music .
0	my son really enjoyed this song , but he did not like the chorus .
0	this is the music that made me fall in love with electronic music for the first time . i could not believe what i wa hearing and i wa hooked ! it wa a completely new world for me . with this album i wa able to enjoy the amazing music of this genre for the first time . it wa a breath of fresh air and i have been listening to it ever since . this album also had a huge influence on my life . it made me a better person , helped me to get over a bitter divorce and gave me the energy to keep going . it pushed my limit and made me stronger .
0	i really really like this song . my daughter thought it wa cute . she liked the chorus and thought the melody wa nice . my son thought the chorus wa cute .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i love this record .
0	this is a bonus track on the cd . i have not listened to the cd . i would not recommend this .
0	i found the song this is my song by the artist , justin timberlake , my first song and it is really nice . i would like to thank whoever wrote this song . i would have to say that this is a very good song and i would recommend it to anyone who like this type of music . i would recommend this song to anyone who is in love with a person and want to be in love with the person .
0	i have heard this song many time before , and i always find it pretty hard to get into . it is too serious . the lyric are too serious and the music is too serious . if you want a hard-rock rocker , then you should listen to black and gold instead .
0	the video for this song wa put up on youtube in 2000. i found it via a link on this site .
1	this is one of the best song i have heard her do . i love this song . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice . it show that she is an artist and an artist ha the freedom to express themselves without being forced into making a song that is popular .
1	i am not a big fan of johnny cash , but the song is very good . i am sure that this is not the only song he ha ever sung . i have a whole collection of his album . i would give it a thumb up .
0	this song ha a great chorus , but the melody is way too upbeat and the rhythm is too fast . i do not like it , but i know many who do . jewel is a very good singer and a very good performer . i just do not like the song .
0	i would have given this album a 5 star rating , but it is just another eagle album . i do not think it is a bad album , but i do not think it is great either . and if you are going to listen to an eagle album , listen to the original first . the original have no filler , and they are all pretty good . the only thing on this album that is not on the original is new day . and the only bad song on this album is new day .
1	i love my iphone

0	i got this cd in a mail-order catalog from amazon . i have to say that there are some great song on here , but i would have loved to have the cd in a jewel case .

1	this would be a great cd for the choir or a small group .

1	this band wa supposed to be the next led zeppelin , but they have been in the shadow of zeppelin for 10 year , so this is a bit of a letdown .

0	i hear this song all the time . i like it .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is an all-time favorite of mine . i listen to this almost every day .
0	this is a collection of music from the 20th century that ha made me cry . sometimes there are no word , just feeling .
1	do not stop believin is the song i would have liked to have heard more of on this cd . it is a good song . it is not a good song . i have heard it on the radio and i have seen it played in movie and tv show . i am not sure why they put it on this album . it is basically a cover of another song by a group called the beatles . it is not really a beatles song . it is just a cover of a beatles song . it is not a bad song , but it is not the beatles . it is just another band . it is not the beatles . it is not
0	i have listened to this album for year and have always liked it . the song title seem to be the weakest part of this album and they do not really need them . sometimes , you realize that there are more song on the album- i wa always reminded of the wailing or the lord is my shepherd . this is his best work yet . i thought he wa going to make an album a la michael w. smith that wa not repetitive and did not talk about the same thing . however , he did make an album that ha good song and is not all about him- that is not to say this is bad- it is merely different .
0	i like the guitar solo .
1	this song is great ! i like the version with the crazy drum beat .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	one of the most beautiful song ever recorded !
0	i like the song . i have listened to many of her song . she is a wonderful singer .
0	this is a good cd . this is a good cd .

1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	not even in the same league a the original , which ha been said to be the best on the cd . this is a really good cd . the band is great , and i am very surprised at how good my ear have heard this cd .
1	this cd wa terrible ! it did not play during the first three song . then it went to a boring song . i almost had to turn off my computer to get it to play again .
0	well , the album itself is decent , but the song are not . there are some beautiful song on this album , but the rest are just a bunch of commercial christian song , which is a waste of your money . this album is an easy listen , but it is not good . i would definitely not buy this album if you listen to it .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i liked playing it christmas morning .

0	i thought it wa good ! i did not like it a whole lot though . i think the song are good , but the production is just a bit weird . other than that , the lyric are great and the music is great .
0	i can only tell you that i did not enjoy this album at all . it is very melodic and tour de force but it lack the originality of other album in the genre . i can only tell you that i did not enjoy the album at all . i am not saying that it can not be listened to , but it is just not my cup of tea .

0	i downloaded a copy of this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i like listening to it . i am not a fan of this song . it is a repetitive song with little charm . it is just a boring piece of garbage .
1	this is one of the best album of the past decade , and the best album of the past 20 .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	bonnie ha one of the best voice in the music world . she ha a beautiful tone to her voice and is able to sing in different style .
1	i love the song i am a man and punk rock and roll . i am a man is my favorite steve morse song .

1	i
0	the first three song of this album were a pleasant surprise , but a with many of my favorite song , the album itself end at the three and half minute mark . it is a shame that the recording wa over so quickly a it is a very good album . i had not heard this album before and it is very easy to listen to . i like the music on this cd . i like the lyric . i like the sound quality . i would like to hear more from this cd .

1	i agree with you , i love your review of this album . i love this album . it is my favorite r. kelly album . this is one of the most beautiful r. kelly album i have ever heard .
0	this self-titled album is the best cd i have ever bought . i think it is worth the $ 14.95 . if it wa a self-title cd with a few of the song on the self-titled cd i would have bought it . i think it is better than most of the other self-title album . i think it is worth the $ 14.95 .

0	i like this cd , but i think it is a better cd than many of the others in this category . the cd is a good collection of song , but i would not buy this cd .
0	this song is so boring .
1	this album is great . the guitar is great . the drum are
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this song ha a great beat , and it is got the right kind of dance and groove that would be good for the show .
0	this is by far the worst tape of all time . i recommend that you throw this tape away .
1	i love this one
0	i have loved this album since the day it came out . i have owned and played it many time . the only song i have not loved is you . i really wish i didnt like that song . this album is much better .
1	a wonderful collection of song , from the 20th century . a beautiful and unique collection , a collection that will hold a special place in your heart . every song is a gem , and a treasure .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .

1	i like the way this song ha a strong message .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this album is very awesome . i love it !
1	i love this song . it is definitely one of the best beatles song . they did a great job with it .

1	this is a good country cd . i bought it because it is a country cd . i did not buy it to listen to it , i bought it because i like country music .
1	great cover and it is a decent song .
0	i really wanted to like this album . i have never heard marie osmond sing anything but her own song and i like her voice . but i just wasnt feeling it . i guess i just needed to hear some old song , but it just wasnt happening .
1	lareine is a very good singer and he ha a pretty good voice . his voice is pretty good because he ha this nice deep voice . he ha a good sound and the track is okay .

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	i like many of the song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	well see if this is bonnies best . i am sure there are some good track , but i am not sure about it being her best . it is difficult to say one is one best and the other is not .
1	i love it ! i have been listening to it since i can remember . it is a really good album and i love the way it is played .
0	this is not the best album ever , but it is enjoyable because the song is catchy and different from other artist . i would give it 4 star but the song is a little different from the uptown funk song .
0	i would recommend this cd to everyone . all the song are great and the lyric are very good . i would give it five star . it is not loud enough to use on the truck , so i am using it at night and at low volume , but that is okay because i can listen to it while i am driving . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
1	this cd is great , but this is the first cd i have ever bought that ha only one song on it . it is good that they have one song but i would have preferred more song on it , but i still think this is a great cd .
0	i am starting to dislike this album . i have heard it a couple of time , and i just did not like it . there is nothing that stand out to me on here .
0	this song rock . i like the video , too .
0	i bought this cd because i have the other one and i wanted to buy the other cd . but i feel like this one is a better cd . it is not a good a the other one , but the sound is great !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i would definitely reccomend this album to my friend .
1	i love this song ! i love the beat and the lyric are so good . this is the best song i have ever heard , period .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	i like jewel music . i love the first two song on her new cd and the music video is great . i love the music video though . i also really like this song . i think i am going to listen to it a lot .
0	i am disappointed in the product . i wa very excited to receive the cd and have been looking forward to playing it in my car . i am disappointed that the cd i received is no where near the quality of the music that is on the cd . the song on the cd are very boring and sound the same . i am looking forward to getting the cd again next year when i order it from amazon since they will not offer a refund . in addition , i wa told that the cd , which cost me over $ 100 , is in a cracked case . they have offered no help in getting this problem fixed and will not offer a refund . i hope that if they do not get the problem fixed that they will refund all the money i paid on the cd because i wa excited to receive it .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this song is great , the video is brilliant .
1	i love the music video .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i really like this song . it sound like sam sparros black and gold , but it is not a good .
1	i love it !
1	i love this album . i like the song in it , and the song have meaning . my girl , the boyfriend song and life is just a bowl of cherry .
0	i like this cd , i wish i did not have to buy it .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	if you like good music , good lyric , good art , and good story told in a good way . this is one of the best music video in the last few year . it is a good mix of many different genre . love it . i think you will like it . i hope you like it . it is a very good song . i believe this band is on it is way to doing great thing . i hope you like this song . i would love to hear a good review of this song .
0	i have to disagree with this one . i like this song , so i am going to include an interesting opinion that doe not necessarily disagree with the review , but rather think that it wa just misinformed . the only reason i can think of for why such a negative review ha been placed on this song is that it is on a soundtrack that ha an overabundance of 80 music in it . i mean , this movie wa released in 2006 , so it would have to be around that time for the song to be overplayed that much . i also believe that the reviewer doe not have the correct background on the movie , so he may be misinformed . the opening scene wa filmed a few year before the film wa released , and this song wa chosen a part of the soundtrack because it wa a pop style that wa the most popular of the 80 . a for the lyric , i believe they are a little bit old-fashioned , but i also believe they are perfectly suited for the film . i will state that i have listened to this song numerous time , and i like it . i personally think the film is better anyway , so that make me think that the reviewer is just wrong .
1	this is the best record of reo speedwagon .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this is good trance music . i feel that the melody are a little bit repetitive , but the music is very good and very melodic . i will recommend this to anyone who want to like trance . this is a good album .
1	i love this record . it is a wonderful collection of music .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	tom wait is not here , but the band ha a great stage presence , and they sounded great . the music wa good and the sound quality wa decent .
0	this is another song i love to listen to on the radio when i am out and about .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is a great song . i like it , but i don ; t know why people do not like it . overall , it is a good song . if you like this song , try this song . this is one of my favorite song . it is a really great song . i love this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . this is one of my favorite song .
1	this is a good cd , but on the other hand , i would like to buy the other song from the cd . there is a nude song which is a good song but there is also a breathless song which is a bad song . the breathless song is much better . i like both of them .
1	i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice because the song is the best song she ha done so far . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice in the best way , and i love the fact that she sings the song in her own . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice because she doe it in her own voice . i like the fact that she sings the story in her own voice because it is the best way to make the story and sing the story .
0	i downloaded this cd , and then got really into the sound of the ponder sister on a country show . i would not recommend this cd . it is horrible .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	very nice ! loved the way it wa sung ! i have seen it used in a lot of show , but it never got to that point .
0	this is an old classic but still a good song . the instrumentation is fine , the vocal are fine and the song is very catchy .
1	this ha been my favorite of the two . i just love how she brings the lyric to life with her voice .
1	this album is so good ! i have never listened to this one before .
0	the song is great . it is catchy and it is great .
1	i am a novice song writer and have not yet written anything worth hearing . this is the first of many mediocre song , but i am going to try to write a song that is worthwhile . in addition to i like the way that you are singing . i would like to write something that say i like the way you sing . in addition to that , i would like to write something that state i like the way that you sing . and i would like to write something that say i like the way that you sing .
0	i love this r.kelly album . i think it is his best album . it is one of his best . i can say this because i like every song on this album . i also like his other album too . i love his cover of other artist . they are great song . i like them all , but the best is love in the first degree . the other song are all good too .
1	i do not really like the song on this album , but it ha some very good one . i am glad i got this album for christmas . i am very much a fan of the album that they put out , and to me , this album fit right in .
1	great song , but it is not a song for every occasion . james taylor is a man of many talent , and this is one of his best single .
1	good song . i think that it is a good song . the song is very good , i love this song .
0	this song made me feel like i wa in a spaceship .
0	i am not a big fan of ohearn at all , but i like this album . i usually do not like to complain about a bad album , but i am going to do it because this album is not a bad album , it is just not very good . it ha some good song in it , but not a great song per se .
0	this is another one that got away from the radio . it wa played for a while , i think when the song wa first released . i do not know if it got to be on the radio at the time because i do not remember it . i just hope people will continue to play it if they hear it .
0	i like the first part of this song . i wa in a traffic accident . it is a very good song .
0	i have been singing this for year and i love it . it is a fun song to sing with my daughter . this song brings back memory of when i wa a kid and we would sing this song .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	just bought this a few day ago and it is awesome ! very nice work . i like how you put in the lyric . very clever .
0	i am not really a fan of bruno mar , but i have to admit that i like this cd . it is basically a collection of pop song with a little bit of dance . i like the song , but i do not know if i could like this album .
1	this album ha been a long time coming .
1	i would heard of this album before , but i would never really looked into it . i am glad i bought it .
1	i really like this song . i like the lyric . it is a little different than the rest of the song , but it is fun . it make me feel like i have been away from my parent for a while . i hope this song can get a far a it is worth .
1	this is a pretty good album . i think it is the best that she is ever done . the vocal quality is good , the music is good , the lyric are good . i think it is good enough to be a very good album . it is not much more than that . i like most of the song , but i think the album is one of her best .
0	i wa introduced to this album by my good friend , and great jazz musician , don mclean . it is one of my favorite piece of music . it is a great collection of recording . i love the way he sings with his hand in the air . the only drawback is that it ha a lot of the same track that you can hear in any number of other recording . there is one song on the album that i do not think i have heard him sing before . i do not know if he played it on record , or if they just recorded it for the album . i have never heard this in a single performance , and i have seen him perform it in many production over the year . it is a great jazz album . it is a great music history lesson for all of u .
0	i have got a friend who is not into the music industry . she doe enjoy the joke though . she say she think this song is great but she just doe not like it . i hope she like it .
0	i bought this cd when i heard it on the radio . i bought it in hope it would help me fight the depression . it did not . it did nothing to help me . it did not bring me joy . it did not make me happy . it only made me feel worse .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell these crap . i will not be purchasing anything until this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time you in need of help do not call the police !
0	i donst think i will be getting this album . i just do not feel the need to listen to another album by this band .
1	i am amazed at how much i love this music ! i have not listened to it in a

0	i hate to give a review for a cd at this point . i have not listened to it yet . the one song that would make me return it is tear by this artist . it is one of my favorite .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i am not a big fan of the album , but it is still an excellent album .
0	this album is good but r. kelly voice is not a great a on the other album . at least that is what i think .
1	i really liked this album . a lot of classic christian song . although the song are a little repetitive , they are worth it for the song alone .
1	this is one of my favorite prince album of all time . i wa happy to see his music pop up on the radio . i love this album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i do not know what to say . sometimes i really like her music , and sometimes i do not . i am a die hard fan of her music , but i have never been a fan of her book .
0	i am not really a huge fan of this song , but i think it wa worth the listen .
0	the eagle never made a bad album . so why did this one suck so much ? i am just glad that this album wa released . i am glad that it wa released before the eagle went on their last tour . i like the song that are on this album . they are pretty good . but it just doe not have anything original or new . and the only bad song is new day .

0	i love the music of these guy . i love the way they write their song . they are awesome live . they are very talented .
1	this is a very powerful song that you should make a point of listening to on a daily basis . it ha a real message and it will really tug on your heart string . the chorus is one of the best thing in the whole song and the lyric are something god ha put together to pull you to the point of tear . it is a very powerful song and i have only ever heard the song in it original form , so i can not compare it to any other version , but it is definitely the best version of the song i have ever heard .
1	this is an excellent album . i like the cover .
0	the sound on this cd is really good . i do not think it wa their best recording , but it is okay . i mean , they could have been better .
0	my parent have always sung this song to me when i wa a little boy . i have always loved this song and wished i could sing it again .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i like this song a lot ! it is a good song ! it is a little slower than the other song , but it is perfect for the slow time in life . great slow song ! i like this song a lot .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this song reminds me of when i wa a kid and my mom sang this song to u . i know that i do not like this version , but it is one of my favorite song . it ha a great melody .
1	i love bonnie raitt . i love her music a well but she is my all time favorite .
1	i have been waiting for this song for a long time . i love the song and the artist . this is an amazing cover . i can not wait to get my hand on the cd . i bought this cd when i saw it on the store and now i have it . i am gon na buy a lot of christmas cd .

0	i am a huge fan of her .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i have been listening to mary cd since the mid-90s . i have always been impressed with her music . i have never been disappointed . i have been disappointed at time , but never disappointed with her music .
1	this song make me want to go to heaven just to hear it again . i love it !
0	i like this cd , i think it is a good collection of song , but i am not sure if it is one that i would buy . it is worth something , but it is not something i would buy in one sitting , or even buy in a couple of evening . it is a nice cd , but i do not think it is a great one .
0	i have always liked jazz piano , but this album is the first album that i really got into it . it is a good album .
0	i don ` t like the music video . the song is not very attractive .
1	i really liked this album . the song are very good and well written . i enjoyed most of the song very much . i am glad i bought the album .
0	this is a good album , i think . it is not what i would consider to be his best , but it is a good album for a great musician and a great artist .
1	so far , this cd is really good . i am really enjoying the music . the cd ha a good message and the song are very nice . the cd is very well produced . i am looking forward to listening to the whole cd .
0	i think it is a great addition to a self-titled cd , but i do not know why it got so many negative review . the review that did not have positive thing to say are just plain silly .
0	what a waste to put this on a cd , what a waste to make it a cover , what a waste to make it sound like gnr . this is nothing special . do not waste your time on it .
0	i did not like this album . it doe not belong on this website , if you want a good rock album go into your closet and go get a good rock and roll album . this album will not give you the rock and roll . i would have like to have seen the band play a little more .
0	i love lareine ! her voice is so strong , her song are very original , and her melody are so special .
1	wow ! this is awesome . great music . i really like the way the song are all arranged . i really like the way the song are all arranged . when i put it on i can hear the song . i am not the biggest classical fan but i think it cool . i think it cool . love this site . i love this site . i love this site . i love this site ! i love this site ! i love these guy !
0	this song is ok , but it is not bad . the vocal are fine and it ha a nice beat . it is a good song .
0	i am sorry i do not have any positive comment . i do not like this album . i did not like the song to begin with . i like the song i believe and we are one . the music is good , but the vocal are horrible .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i wa looking for a song i had heard several time and , lo and behold , i found it on this cd ! a a matter of fact , i have listened to this cd several time and have not yet found a song i like . i bought this and the 4 previous one a a part of an extensive series . i have no idea which one is which . i do not think i will be returning them . i do not even know which one is the best . however , i will tell you that the cd that is in the series is the worst i have ever heard . it is the worst . the singing in the cd is so bad that i can not believe they would go through the effort to make the cd ( and they all are quite good ) . i do not know what they are trying to sell with this series of cd .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i liked this album and it song .
1	i love this album . it is my favorite album of all time . i love e.s.posthumus . i play it a lot . he is great .
1	i like john ; i like the music he writes .
0	just a very good cd but the problem is that the picture is very poor and the sound is not good . i do not know about the sound , but the picture quality is not good .
0	this album ha been on the radio for a long time . i like it but i do not think it is very good . some of the vocal are very un-professional . the arrangement is not very good . some of the lyric are not very good . i think that you should make a new album with song that you like .

1	very catchy . i love this song .
1	wow , i can not believe i have not heard this song before . maybe i will buy it and see what the hype is all about .
1	i love the song i believe that lareine wrote . it is a powerful message to his people that he hope to inspire them to live the way to which they believe in . he sings it with conviction , and he look in the eye of his people that he belief in so much .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .

1	this is an amazing cd . i love it .
0	this is my favorite song on the album !
1	this song is not about what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man she doe not really care about . this song is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone he is not really in love with . and how he feel when he is having sex with someone who belief him and how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not . it really doe not have anything to do with what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man she do not really care about . the song is not about what other people should do , it is about what a woman should do when she is having sex with a man that she doe not really care about .

1	this cd would be perfect for a relaxing drive to work or for a peaceful evening . the song are very positive and i enjoyed listening to them .
0	the sound quality is not great so i can not listen to it over and over again .
1	one of the key element in making this album is the use of the sound of silence [ a noted in the note ] to create the contrast between the bright , almost bombastic , sound of the orchestra and the quiet , almost ethereal , sound of the soloist .

0	this is a good song , but not one of the best . i can not even really say it is a good song , because it is not . i am not saying it is a bad song , but it is not a good song either . the only good thing about it is that it ha some good lyric and great musicianship .

0	this song ha been on my list for a long time . i like the music and the voice , but i do not know if i like it . i am not sure why i do not like this song .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this is a great cd ! i love the band ! i love the music ! i love the song ! this is a great cd ! i love the band ! i love the music ! the lyric are great ! i love the band ! i love the song ! i love the music ! i love the band ! i love the music ! this is a great cd ! i love the band !

0	i had heard about this song and wanted to listen to it . i tried it and it wa nothing special .
1	this song wa not only written for our generation , but also our youth . it is an upbeat song , and a positive song .
1	i believe this is the best song ever and i love this song . i love jesus . i love this song . i love the fact that we are all a part of god . we are a part of god .
1	this song is a great mix of rap and rock . i thought it wa a nice song .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	a very good album
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i have listened to this album for so many year now , that i am not sure it still ha the same quality a the first time i listened to it . i do not know if it ha gotten better or worse , but it is not bad .
1	this is a great song .
1	i found this song on one of the most amazing new release and listened to it for hour . it is by far one of my favorite song . this is definitely a song that you should buy .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i have been a fan of jewel since her first cd dreaming . i have been very disappointed with her music since then . this is definitely one of the worst album i have ever heard . the music is not bad , it is just jewel . it is horrible . the song are repetitive and boring . the vocal are horrible . the lyric are terrible . the star is the worst . it is just a shame that i wa so used to jewel amazing voice on dreaming that i am forced to listen to this .
1	the only reason i give this 5 star instead of a 4 star is
1	i have never heard a chicago symphony orchestra recording that sound so good . this is just the chicago symphony orchestra . i really like this recording .
0	i like this song , but it just sound so generic . i do not even know what kind of song it is .
0	i love this song . the vocal are really good here . the guitar work is great , but the drum just seem . i do not know what they do . the piano playing is ok. the song is very fun .
1	this album is a very good album . she ha a great voice .
0	i downloaded this cd to get a taste of the new single i am not there by the new pornographer . the song , at least to my ear , sound like a song by the who . i have no desire to buy the cd and have no interest in listening to it . i will probably stop reading this review before i finish it . my comment are about the song itself . i can not hear the bass or the drum . the vocal are ok , but i do not like the way they sound . they are very distorted and have a very nasal sound . i would have preferred a recording that had a fuller sound .
1	i am a big fan of this . it is my favorite of the two .
0	this is the first official remix of the song , so i am not gon na comment on it too much . the remix doe not have the same feel to it , but it doe have some really good , hard hitting beat that are very catchy . i would like to see a video with the remix in it . i hope miley doe not discontinue this song . i would like to have a song that i can listen to and dance to , but i am glad it is still going .
0	i wa excited to listen to this cd . i love the song , a good heart is a good heart is a good heart is a good heart . i wa expecting a good cd . it just doe not live up to the hype . i could not understand the word . i could not understand why this cd wa so hyped up . i could understand that the cd wa so hyped up , but i could not understand why it wa so hyped up .

0	billie– joe armstrong is a wonderful singer ! this song is a very good song .
0	i am a fan of hammond and enjoy his work . i really like this album . i think it is the best one he ha released in a while . i also think the album is too long . i would cut it down .

0	this song is so bad i can not even find the lyric in the lyric to tell you what the song is about .
1	i love this song . it is very relaxing and doe not get boring . i recommend this song to any and everyone .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i like the production .
1	this song is so good , and it is so bad . i really like the bass but i hate the song .
1	i bought the cd i had been looking for , and i love it .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	this song is very catchy and the beat is very good . it make me want to dance to it .
0	this is the song in the movie , and i do not think it is the same song a the movie .
0	i have never been a big prince fan . i used to think he wa a genius , but now i am a fan . i wa a fan of the purple rain movie and the diamond and pearl movie . i think his music helped me overcome my love of the movie purple rain . i also loved his music in the purple rain and raspberry beret movie . i bought this album because it wa one of his last studio album . i love this album for all of these reason .
0	i really like this album . it is a great album .
1	this cd is very good . i have to say that i prefer her singing to that of other artist .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	a great live album from a great band . this is a must have for any metalhead .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i believe the song , oh christmas is a great song . it make me think of family and friend and i love the fact that i can sing it to my family .
0	i think this one is the best of all .
0	this album is good , but it is a little on the slow side .
0	most of the song are very old . i would have given her a 5 star , had she gone on to write more song .

1	this song is really good !
0	i listened to this album several time , but i just did not like it .
1	i know that this ha been reviewed several time before ( including in the thread linked above ) , but i have to tell you that this is one of the best performance by an orchestra i have ever heard . it is not only the musicianship , but the mix of instrument and the dynamic is incredible .
0	it is a nice song with a decent beat . it is a waste of time .
1	i like these guy , i like the song . i like the song because it is a new song from a new band ( that is like saying that i do not like a band because i have never heard of them ) , but it is fun to listen to their music . i like the fact that it is different from the other song on their album . i like the fact that it is very positive and uplifted .
0	i am totally in love with the music in this show . it is amazing , i wish everyone would see it . the movie is even better .
0	the vocal were not bad on this album . the drummer wa really good . the rhythm section wa good . it is a good album with great song that i could listen to over and over . but the vocal were just so . it is hard to explain . i can not really put my finger on it . it is just a bad singing voice . i am not talking about the vocalist , but the guy singing the lead vocal . i do not know what kind of singer he is . but it is just so un-hip . it is like no one in the band ever sang like that . i do not know what to say . it just doe not sound like a song . it is just a bunch of song that are just bad vocal , with no melody or rhythm or anything . i do not know how they can say they are classic . it just doe not sound like a classic rock song . it just sound like it is written for kid . it is really sad . i do not know what happened here . i give this album 3 star .
1	i love this movie ! the original is so much better ! there is no point in listening to this .
0	this is the worst album cover i have ever seen . the original song had a lot of meaning , but this cover doe not do it justice . there are two song on here , one called the end and the other which doe not really matter , st. louis blue . the first song really is the best , but the latter is not to my taste . it sound like a 12 year old girl who can not be more than 23. and the song st. louis blue sound like a country song . and i do not like country song .
1	i absolutely love this song . even though i am not a fan of the song starboy , it is catchy , and there is something about it that i like .
1	i love this song ! i love the song . i love this song and i am going to buy it . i love this song ! i love this song ! i love the song . i love your song !
1	this album is from the band the wailing , which will be on my favorite band list . i love their album the wailing . this album is very well sung . the song are very well written and they are very well sung . this album is a great album for worship and praise . i would recommend this cd to anyone who want a worship and praise album .

0	i am the most disappointed of all the reviewer . you all have rated this song at 5 star . please rate this song at 1 star and call the song a poor job . how could you make such a song a 5 star ? i am disappointed . you will all rate this song a lower rating than i do .
1	this is the tom wait live recording from the band first full-band concert . this concert wa filmed and later recorded on a tape and sold a a live album , but wa later deemed to be a demo of a live concert recorded at a different venue .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i love your music !
0	this is not an awful cd . i love this song . however , i bought it for my nephew birthday , and it wa a terrible waste of money . the cd is nothing more than a cd of your son saying , i love you . this is not how a cd should sound . i will never listen to this cd again . the audio quality is very poor . the sound quality on this cd is atrocious . this is not an average cd . this is not a cd of a child with a bad disposition . this is someone with an inferior brain . this is a cd with a poor recording quality . i do not think this is a good cd , and i do not think it should be on the market . i do not think there is any way to improve the audio quality of this cd . i feel like i am listening to a dead cat on a speaker . this is the worst cd i have ever heard . the lyric are horrible , the audio quality is horrible , and the sound quality is terrible . this is the worst cd i have ever heard . the audio is horrible and the sound quality is horrible . this is one of the worst cd i have ever heard . i bought this cd because my nephew told me i had to have it . i love this cd . i love the idea of a cd with beautiful music , and i love the idea of i love yous and i miss yous . however , the cd is not that . the cd is a cd with a dead cat on a speaker . i think this cd is worthless . i am a very hard-core cd collector , and i will not listen to this cd . i do not care about the music , but i do care about the cd . i feel bad for my nephew , but i do not feel bad for myself .
1	tom scott is an amazing jazz musician , and he ha some very good cd , which i will recommend to you .
0	my son thought it wa cute . my daughter did not like it .
1	i like that song ( mp3 download of i like that ) , with good sound . i have heard it before but not that much . it is a decent song , but it is not a great song either . if you like it , you will like the rest of the album .
0	this is a good album , although i do not really have a favorite one . the song are very good but i do not really like the whole thing .
1	a recording that go beyond the normal boundary of the genre . there are some of the most gorgeous and elegant orchestral passage on this cd . you will find yourself completely lost into the music and not be fully able to discern the instrument at all .
1	i love this song ! it is very entertaining to watch !
1	i love the way the instrumental are structured . it is very cool . i love how they do what they do , the music is very good but not too much . very nice .
1	this is an enjoyable album . i love christmas music and this is the perfect album to listen to while waiting for the other album to come out . it is also a great album to start off with .
1	this is one of my favorite song ! there is only one word to describe this song . it is so good . i love the vocal . it is one of my favorite song !
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

0	this is the same singer a on the last album . she sings the same old song but ha a bit more energy .
1	i wa looking for a cd that wa country but not just country but old time country .
0	the first track is not good . the second is okay , not great . the rest are average . there is no tom wait .
1	bonnie is an awesome singer . she is a little on the old side , but i like that . i like the diversity of the song on this album . they are fun and unique .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is the first album i have heard that i have liked . i am not sure why others do not seem to like it . i still like the music but i think i will be going back to my old jvj album .
1	i like dave clark five , their music , and all of their recording .

0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	a must have for guitar , bass and drum player .
0	it is not great , but it is not bad . the song are decent for the most part , but the album is anemic , and the production is pretty forgettable .
1	i love r.kelly . not only is he talented , but he is a talented singer .
1	this is the best trance
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	just an fyi , this is the first time i have heard this song and it is awesome .
0	i always had a problem with this song . i liked the song but there wa always a problem with the lyric . this is like the i am in love with myself problem . it is an interesting song but not everyone can relate to it . i think it is a great tune and is very enjoyable . i have a lot of respect for tom wait , but this song is a joke . i do not think it is a terrible song but it is a very weak effort that i can never get behind .
1	i would like to know why the original version of this song is not available anymore . it is amazing !
1	i have heard this song before on the radio , but i thought it wa really good . i bought it on line and i am glad i did . it is really good .
1	i agree with the other reviewer who said this cd wa garbage but i thought this would have made it to the top ten . i thought it would have been up there with flahooley or carrie . not all of the song are bad , however . the cd itself is pretty good with some good song . i also heard an interview with her on radio . i liked what she had to say a lot . i liked the cd for what it wa and i am glad i found it .
1	the album is very strong and heavy . it ha a heavy , but very good guitar sound , a very good drum sound and a very good bass sound . i would say this album is a little more metal then most punk rock album . this is not a bad album . i would say this is a very strong album .
1	this app rock ! we use it at church !
0	this is a really good song , i really like it .
1	i bought this cd because i wanted to know more about the other side of the beatles and i have to say . this is a good album . i could not put it down and it wa worth every penny . it is very good . i can not imagine , listening to this for the first time , how many beatles album i will have on my shelf .
0	it sound like a good song , but it is not . i think it is a little boring , and the lyric are a little boring . it is not a good song to listen to .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i do not know about this one , but it is a good song . it wa on the radio the other day and i decided to put it on . i have had good luck with radio a far a song that i really like go . i have not had a bad experience so far .

0	i have been doing a lot of singing and doing rock and i have a few of these on my ipod and it got me thinking about the song meaning or origin . i do not have a clue what the song mean . i do not know if it from either the music , or the country or some other reason . i personally find it a little annoying .

1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

1	loved this song . very beautiful , powerful and inspiring . you could feel the pain and sadness in the lyric .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	the new album is one of my favorite .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	she ha a potential to be really good .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	she doe not sound like the real madonna , which is something i can not forgive .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	the chicago orchestra is the only orchestra i ever heard that play this many instrument . i have never heard an orchestra play the concerto in c major that play this many instrument . the chicago symphony orchestra is the only orchestra i have ever heard that play this many instrument in the right time and the correct way . i have never heard a chicago symphony orchestra recording that play this many instrument in the right time and in the correct way .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i think the song is boring . it is like a song from a movie . it is like a piece of a movie .

0	this is a self-titled cd . the lyric are terrible .
1	this is an amazing album .
0	i love this cd . i love the song . i think the cd cover art is very generic , but the cd is very good .
1	i love to dance to this song .
1	this song is so good . i love it . the first time i heard it wa at the radiate festival in england , in the summer of 2011. it wa by far the most popular song and took the top spot . the first time i heard it wa at a wedding and there wa not even a second song sung , just the chorus . the second time i heard it wa at a baby shower for my niece and her husband . i played the song for them and they were so thrilled to hear it that they all sang together . it wa magical . the first time i heard the song at a concert in france wa at the festival in nantes . i wa overwhelmed .
1	i like this song because it reminds you to stay true to who you are .
1	this song is so cool . i have been listening to this song for so many year , but i just figured out that i have never heard it before . i can not believe that i have never heard it . it is a very cool song . i hope you all like it .
0	this is a very old album . it doe not sound that old . the song sound fresh . if you are a church music fan , this one might be right up your alley .
0	this is a great album for those who do not mind a few pop song . the first song is the only pop song i know that is not a parody of some other pop song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i wa surprised by barbra streisand voice . it is very clear but it is not bad . it is not her best but it is not bad .
0	she sings better than she ha on song from her debut album .
0	it ha some interesting synths .
0	this is a great album to listen to . i love it . it is a good selection of song . i love it . i enjoy listening to this . i like the sound quality . it is a good album . it is a really good album . i really like it . great album .
0	i liked this cd , but i wish it would have been better , or at least the song were better .
1	i like the beatles .
1	i liked the title . it wa a catchy tune . the music is not very smooth . it is a little bit more subdued than the other tune in the cd . i like that . the vocal are also a little more subdued . i like the song from this cd . i do not like the others song from this cd . some of the others are not very special . i also liked that there are a lot of instrumentals in this cd . they were a little bit more interesting . i will listen to them all before i buy the other cd .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i like the song , and i like the album so far , but i think it need more songwriting and performance in the song i did not like , but overall it is a great album .
0	a wonderful recording . i love this . the sound is great , but the sound is not clear . i have used many sound system , but i still prefer this one .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i just got this from amazon . it is a very good album .
0	it go fast
1	i wa really excited to get this a soon a it appeared in the store because it is the latest cd by hasselvander and i really enjoy his music . i have bought several of his album , but this one is my first one .
1	this is very good album . i love it !
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i really like this song , but i think i would change the sound effect , i liked them but the song wasnt enjoyable to me . the only other thing i would change would be the lyric . i did not like the song but it wasnt all bad . i guess it is hard to tell . all i know is i liked the song . i guess it is hard to put into word .
0	the song are ok .
1	this is a great cd ! i like the song ! i like the band ! i like the lyric ! i like the band ! this is a great cd ! i like the song ! i love the band ! i love the music ! i like the band ! i like the song ! i like the band ! the lyric are great ! i like the song
0	this is more of a conumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait this is a live recording of the first and nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert , perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very dis-concerting .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i have heard this song many time , but i finally found out what it mean . it is about taking people place . i have loved this album so far . i will be buying the next album a soon a it is released .
1	i love the sound of ohearns music . the music is very relaxing and the lyric are very profound . i also love the fact that he us the drum a his main instrument and that is something i have never come across before . the drum are very good indeed and that is what make the music very satisfying . his other instrument is the piano and that is another instrument that i have never encountered before . i think he is the best of the best and if i wa to choose one artist to listen to then i would have to say that i would have to go for ohearn .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	the original version of a hard day night is a perfect pop song . the new version sound like the old version .
0	this cd is pretty good . i thought it wa okay , but it doe not have the energy packed into it that i would have liked . the music is okay , nothing great , but it is a good cd .
1	the cd is great ! i bought it because i love country music .
1	this cd is a pretty good record , however it ha no sound . i have never heard of this band , so i do not know . i like the cover and i like the album title , so i hope they have good review .
1	this cd is a must have for any believer or non-believer . you will not be disappointed . if you have never heard of this artist , check out his cd let the music play . it is a great cd . if you are happy with this cd it is a must have . if you do not , it is a waste of money . it is a good christian cd . if you have never heard of this artist , check out his record let the music play and let the music play .
0	i must admit that i could not take my eye off you after you came on stage after the first set . you did not disappoint .
1	the song is excellent and i think the lyric are also very good . i love the chorus , but the last line is a little too long . the song really hit u in the gut when we were with my parent .
1	this is my favourite song on the cd . i think it would be a great christmas album , i also love the video
0	i like the music but i think the video is really stupid .

0	i love this song . especially since you can find the lyric at the bottom of this review . one of the best i have ever heard . my husband is a great listener . i love him very much . he just love any good song .
0	first of all , this is a very good song . i think it is one of the best . it is a good mix of genre and ha a good message . i think you will like it . i hope you like this song .
0	this song is a good one . they are good , but it is not a great song . i would not listen to it all the time but it is a good one . i can not believe that they are in the top 100 .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i got my copy via amazon . i have not listen to the whole album but i have already heard it . it is a great album . it take you on a journey through a love affair . it is beautiful . i really enjoy listening to this album .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this album sound like a mix of rock and pop and is a good album to listen to .
1	this song make no sense at all . it is not funny , and it is not a good song . but the lyric are so horrible , it make it even worse . the only good thing about this song is that david lee roth is a good singer . he is a better singer than jewel , and they have a good band . the problem is , their music suck .
1	: this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i love it .
1	tom scott play like a great jazz guitarist . he play great jazz standard at a great speed . he play great jazz standard at a great speed . he play great original tune and original tune at a great speed . tom scott also play the blue with his guitar at a great speed . this is a great album and i will recommend it to all jazz fan .
0	i thought this album wa excellent ! i love the music and the lyric , and the album art is beautiful .
0	the most important thing is to have fun , but that is pretty difficult when you are driving down to the beach in your car and everything is going to plan and then someone get hit by a car and you have to have a funeral that last for 12 hour .
1	this is an excellent version of the song . the original is a classic . the arrangement ha a very nice melody and the vocal are great .
1	john prines is a very talented singer songwriter . this is a great song .
1	i love this miley cyrus song . the video is great !
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	this is the version of the song , which i have been enjoying on your site for the past couple of month . i have enjoyed it so much that in the last couple of week i tried to download a number of your song , but i have been unsuccessful , and i would really like to have the full version of this song . can you please upload it ? thanks . bob
0	this song is not that good . it is ok. the beat is good , but the lyric are not that good .
1	this is the best way to read to your kid . this app is very simple to use and ha the best way to read to baby . there is no need to use a book !
0	i wa not a fan of whitney houston music before , but i guess i do like her music now . i really like her recording . i like how she sings them . i like how she just seems to know what to do when she sings .
1	i love the old school mariah . this is a great cd . i really enjoy it .
1	this song wa the first thing that came into my head when i heard the song santa claus is coming to town by the rolling stone . i love this song and this artist ! i can not wait to get my hand on this cd . i have been looking for this cd since i saw the cover in the store and now i have it ! i am gon na buy a lot of christmas cd !
0	oh man , the way i always knew this song by heart ? that is because it is the only song that i have ever actually wanted to be in the movie the dawn of the world ! how can anyone be so dumb ? it is a classic !
0	this cd ha a really cool song with a cool rhythm . it is not too hard and is very easy to understand .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i love this song . i believe the song is about the glory of god , especially his love for u . it is like the song say he love you , he love you so much , he love you so much , you do not need another reason to love you , he love you so much .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i did not think i would like this cd at all but i am glad i did . it is really good and the lyric are nice .
1	this is a great collection of song . not a great collection of song but a great collection of song .
1	awesome ! excellent !
0	i have enjoyed this album for a long time , but i am really disappointed with the lyric .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	i like him .
0	this album is what made this band on the map . one of my favorite . one the greatest song they ever wrote and still a favorite after all these year
0	i am a huge fan of all the song on this cd - this is the only one i have not liked ! i just can not get why anyone would listen to this song .
1	the video is pretty good , i think that the lyric are good .
0	i like this song . the vocal are nice and the lyric are cool . the instrumentation is nice and the song is very catchy .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i have been a dave clark five fan for year and year . my first experience with the dave clark 5 wa at a concert at the hampton coliseum in hampton , virginia , about 15 year ago . this wa my first time seeing them perform live . this show wa one of the show that the hampton coliseum hold yearly . at this show , dave clark 5 took the stage and there wa a long , long , long line of fan waiting outside . you could call it a mob in a sense , but not really . the fan were there to see dave clark five . they were there for a good reason . i wa there with my family and there were about 50 of u standing outside that night . the line wa so long that i had to stop myself from going through the crowd and getting one of the seat inside . it wa the longest concert i have ever been to . i wa there to see dave clark 5 , not to get a great seat in the building . i wa there with my family , so it wa the first time i had ever seen dave clark 5 a a fan and not a a concert attendee . i wa there to see him perform and he wa phenomenal . you could tell that the band wa having a great time . they were having a great time . i did not want to see any of the other band on the bill that night , so i went to the bathroom , got a beer and listened to dave clark 5. they were great . they were great . they were great . i wa there to see the dave clark 5 , not to get in a standing room only spot . i wa there to see them perform and they were great . they were truly great , and i am happy to say i got to see them a second time . this show wa at the hampton coliseum . dave clark 5 played that night and
0	i love these album . they are all wonderful . i have just two complaint . 1 ) it might be time for the major label to do away with the practice of putting out the same album every 2 year . the same album could be put out every year for the rest of their existence . 2 ) the sound is too high-pitched and squeaky-clean sounding for my taste . i would like to see the album cover of the windmill of your mind or the windmill of your mind - live or dalio and his orchestra - live
0	the eagle greatest hit wa a pretty good album . this album just doe not improve on it . they tried to do something different , but it did not work . i guess the problem is that this album wa recorded when the eagle were on their last tour . so they got it all over the place . the vocal are pretty good , but the music is pretty boring . i like the song from this album , and i do not think that this album is a bad album . but it is not the best eagle album . the version of new day on this album is the same a the version on the original album . the version on this album is simply not a good version .
0	i love this album . i buy a lot of album and this album is on my list of album to buy .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i like this song , i think it is a great song .
0	i love listening to this collection of gershwin music . it ha some of the most beautiful music . these recording are not only great in the sense that they are great in their own right , but they are wonderful in how they are so different in their own way .
1	i bought a tape ( which is the same a case ) of this album . the case is a nice metal one . it ha the lyric printed on the label . the case is white with the rise up logo on it . the tape is blue with the lyric painted on it . this is the only tape i have ever bought . i have listened to it many time and i really like it . it is a really good album . the best thing about this tape is that it is not just a compilation of song . there is a lot of cool stuff on here .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	this is not a song that i want to listen to over and over again . some of the track are pretty good , but this is just not one of them .
1	this cd is the
1	this is a great album
0	i like this cd . i love their music .
0	it is got a good beat .
1	i bought the cd for my sister , she really liked it .
0	lareine is pretty bad . i like it a lot though .
1	i bought this collection on the recommendation of a friend . i wa pleasantly surprised . i thought that it would be a collection of random song but it is not and it is very beautiful and good .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	not a fan of this cd
1	this is a great song ! i have to tell you , i am one of the many people that have not heard a song this good .
0	this is a very well played , and executed album . i think it is better than any of the pop music that ha come out in the last few year .
1	really great song , very catchy . i love the beat , and i love the line about the world changing . the beat is very good , it is really nice and the song is good . i like that the song is not too fast , the song is very good .
1	i do not know why i do not love this song a much a i used to . in fact , i can not remember the last time i heard it . i think we are supposed to love it and hate it at the same time . and it is great , and i am glad i have it in my car .
0	i have listened to it a long time , and although the song are not bad , there are some very good one and some that are not so good
0	good cd , but the lyric on this cd are not what i expected .
1	this song is great ! it is very fun and upbeat . the lyric make it very different from the other song on the album . i really like it . i am going to buy the cd again .
1	this is a great album . my daughter like it and i also do .
0	it is a damn good album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i really like the song on this album .
1	this is one of my favorite album i have ever played . the music is a little dated , but it still good . i do not know if i will be buying it again . i feel like it is better for what it is , but i will probably play it a few time . i will post my review after i bought it .
1	this song is great ! i love this song !
1	i really enjoy the album . the song have a great feel for just about every song . the music is great ! i bought it on a whim and i am glad i did . it is a great cd .

0	the best song i like in this cd is the only song i like in this cd . the best part is that it is a cover . i really like the music . i would give it a 4 star rating . the worst part is that they broke the song into part and sold each song separately for $ 14.95 .
0	this song suck . it is not even a half decent song . it is a cover of one of her song . and it just suck . i love the original song , but the cover make it sound like it is crap . it is just not good . the original song is better . the second time around is worse than the first . it is a shame because i think it could have been a good cover with someone who could sing better .
0	i think it is a good song . it make me feel like i am in the movie casablanca .
1	this is a pretty good song . the only thing i would change is the ending , it is not into song with acapella quiet ending . i really like the song though .
0	this is the first of two disc i have purchased . i have been listening to them for over a year , and they both sound great . the first disc ha a slower tempo , the second a faster , but the sound is the same .
1	it is good .
0	this cd is a good piece of music , but it is just way too long for a holiday gift . we all know that christmas is a time for giving , but i am not sure that this particular gift is doing much for the cause . i have always thought that it is better to give a gift that is unique , that add something new to the household , than to give one that is just a duplicate of something someone else ha already received .
0	i wa so disappointed with this album i could only listen to it when i wa alone . i found this album to be very dissapointing . it sound like it wa made in a hurry and not very serious about the sound .
0	i listen to a lot of different type of music . i like the variety of song on this album !
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this song is great . i like this album .
1	i love the melody , the lyric , and the solo song .
0	i wa at the gym yesterday and i saw a copy of this song on the treadmill . it is not exactly my cup of tea because i do not think it fit the vibe i like in a song .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	the song ha a nice beat , and it got the right kind of dance and groove that would be good for the season .
0	i wish i had listened to this album when it came out . it is not the best album ever . but i am glad it wa released . very good album .
0	i bought this album on 2/4/12 when i realized i had missed all the video for them . it wa the first time i saw them and i wa blown away by everything . i would buy this album again in a heartbeat .
1	i love this song
0	i donít like this song at all . it is boring .
1	mighty is the lord is the name of a song from this album and it is an excellent message of worship . the song is a great praise song . it is the best praise song from this album . the sound quality is good and the song ha good lyric . the backing music is good too . the song is very simple and the lyric are very clear .
0	i would like to point out to anyone who listens to this cd , that this cd is not even close to uptown funk . it is by no mean the best uptown funk album , but it is certainly better than the next uptown funk album , love on . i really do not understand why anyone would buy this album . the disc is so mediocre that it is unbelievable that anyone would buy it .
1	i have been a fan of your work for a long time . i just wanted to say thank you for writing and singing song that mean so much to me . i have been thinking about you this morning and will sing this song with my husband this afternoon . i love it ! thank you ! i am so happy you wrote this song !

1	she is a very talented singer and songwriter . the beat are very good and the song is very nice . the lyric are very nice . i like the version of this song done by the original artist and they are very good . the beat and lyric of this song are very nice . i have a version of one artist and they are very good . the beat is very good and this song is very nice . i like this song better . i have a version of someone and they are very good and the beat is very good . this song is very nice . i have a version of someone and they are good . this song is very nice .
0	the cd is about a good a it get . no song is bad . she is pretty , but not enough to make the cd worth it . if you do not care for song and want to hear a nice voice-this is the cd to get .
0	i have been looking for a song with a similar message to this . so far , i have found only one which doe not have the same message . a lot of people have probably heard this song , but they have not heard this one . however , if they have , they are probably not aware that the two song are the same . it is a good looking song , but it is not a very good song . i do not believe that a song with a similar message wa ever made , but this one doe have a very good message and it is one of the few song , other than one other song , that i like . this song is another song that i like . it is very easy to read and the message is there , but it is not clear . i do not like the message this song ha and i do not think it is a good song or a good message . i like the message , but i do not like the song . it is one of the best song i have heard yet and i have heard so many song that are pretty good that this one is among the worst . i do not like this song and it is one of the worse song i have heard yet . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . i do not like this song , but it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all of this year . it is something i have to listen to , but i think i will never listen to it again . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year .
1	i like the apps . they are very good for the money .
0	i got this disc to help me practice for a singing contest . i would not get a good recording of me because i wa singing flat and had no attitude . the recording that i got wa not recorded flat and wa not singing with any attitude . i could not understand a word that wa being sung . the singer had no attitude . she just sung like a robot . i feel a lot of people who get this disc are getting their voice to sound really terrible .
0	it is a good album , but not great or even good . a great album , but not worth the price .
0	this song is a great way to listen to her singing . she ha a great voice , but nothing beat the original .
1	this is a really good song ! i like it .
1	i bought this cd not really expecting much . i have the cd , and i do listen to her music . i have purchased her album a few time and i listen to them . i really did not expect much . i wa just going to listen to it and see how i liked it . i have been very pleased with the cd although i do not know if it is her best work . i will buy the cd one day for sure . it is a beautiful cd .
1	i am happy to say that i have bought this cd and i am enjoying it . i am glad to see such great music on the internet .
1	this song is just soo good ! it is my favorite song of the whole cd ! the cd is soo good , i love the vocal ! : )
0	can anybody explain this song .
0	this is terrible . i wish it wa longer .
0	i love prince with a passion . this is the best prince album i have ever listened to . it is like a masterclass in prince . i wa amazed at how the song fit on the album . they are all different and have a great flow to them . i wa so impressed . this is the best prince album .
1	i have been listening to this album since i wa a teenager . i have heard a couple of song from it but i never heard it until i heard this interview done by a great radio station . it wa with a lady who wa a songwriter . she asked the artist about the song all alone with something to say . he said that he wrote it in a church . that it wa a song that wa like a hymn . he said that it wa really personal . that the song could be about anything . that the song wa inspired by memory and thought that he had been having . that the song wa based on a real relationship .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i am a huge fan of sam sparro on idol . i would rate this cd a a 7. it is no wonder that she wa so popular on the show . she can sing and performs at a good level . i like her style of singing .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i bought this album because of the great review . i thought i would give it a try . i thought it sounded great . not really all that interesting , but i thought it wa well done .
1	this song is the most beautiful song i have ever heard . it just take me over . i am not going to lie , i have had a lot of bad experience with men in my life . it is time for me to start being better and show that i am worth something . thank you lorde .
0	i had this album at a concert at the seattle center . the set list consisted of three song from this album ( the one and two ) and a song from the dave clark five , do not you care . i loved this album .
1	music brings me back to my most important relationship .
0	it is a nice album , but i can not say that this is a good album . i am glad they are still alive . but i think the last album is better .
0	these are the type of song that make me want to make a full on metal version of this song . it is a catchy little pop song that is very easy to dance to . i like this song because it is very easy to dance to , and i like a good pop song . i do not usually download song , but i downloaded this song and it wa a good choice .
1	i have been listening to this album for a few day now and i have found it to be a very good mix of different genre . i really like that she wrote a song about being in a relationship that doe not work yet a different song about a man that did .
1	i love the way she sings , and the lyric are very good .
1	i heard this song when i wa a teenager and i have always loved it . i love the message of hope and the melody . thanks for this . i will buy this song .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i have listened to this for year , but it is just not my cup of tea .
1	this album had good music . and i would have rated it 4 star except the song i am not the buddha is really annoying . and i think the song i am not the buddha should have been the last song on the album , because the other song are just a good a the last one .
1	this is a good song . this is a good song . i like it .
1	a true artist in my opinion . i have listened to this song so many time , and i still get chill and goosebump each time i listen to it . it is an incredible piece of music .
1	i have always loved the lyric to song and love to listen to song with lyric . this collection of song were wonderful and i am very pleased with the lyric . i hope that the song on this album will remain favorite and that i will be able to listen to them for year to come . i hope that you will continue to write great song or that you will continue to write music that will be enjoyed by many people .
1	this album is a good choice for a gay man who is looking for a good album . the song are very well written and the album sound great . however , there are a few song that are just plain boring to me .
0	i found an older song on my mp3 collection called , i will be home before christmas . it made me feel sad that christmas wa about to come .
1	this song ha a beautiful melody that
0	i like the david bowie song hero .
0	very good
0	this album wa the most amazing album that i have ever heard . i will admit , i wa very skeptical when i first heard this album because i wa not sure it wa going to be a good a i remembered . i wa surprised at how good this album really is . the song are all very different and it is not repetitive at all . the song are very well written and the band is really tight . the music is very smooth and very listenable . i really enjoy listening to this album because it is so different . i have even put this on my ipod .
0	this cd ha made me feel depressed .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this album is great . it ha been long time since i listened to this album .
1	i love your site . i recently bought your cd on my website after having heard it many time on the radio .
1	this is by far the best trance album that i have ever heard and i have had a few . this one is my favorite . this is the only positive review i have ever written .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	although the song is very repetitive , the guitar solo is great . the only negative is that it seems a little overdone in the bridge .
0	i wa so disappointed when i saw this . i love the cover art and the song on the cd is wonderful , but the cd itself doe not play . i will never listen to a great cover cd by a band like this again .
0	i have been a fan of jewel for many year and have bought all of her album . this is my favorite of her album . i really enjoy listening to this cd . the song are nice and the sound quality is good .
1	this band is excellent . i have heard them a number of time , and this is the first time i have ever heard tom wait sing . the music is good , and the vocal are not great .
1	the cover of the show is so awesome i just had to post it here . the vocal are awesome . i had to share this with my friend .
1	a wonderful cd . the song are not bad and the sound quality is wonderful . just hope that the quality of the audio can be improved in the future . however , there is no doubt that the cd is a terrific and exciting way to experience the broadway musical . i would rate it 3.5 star . a must-have for any broadway lover . and now , for the best part - the price ! the price is a steal . for $ 20 you get a cd with all of the song included in the original broadway cast recording . the cd also ha all the bonus material that wa included on the broadway cast recording , including the first 2 episode of the show fiddler on the roof . if you have never seen fiddler on the roof , then by all mean , you must get this fabulous cd . the second most important feature of the cd is the fiddler on the roof bonus material . this is amazing . it is a must-have . the production of fiddler on the roof is a wonderful show . i am very excited about it . you can get this wonderful cd for a mere $ 20.00 .
1	i love this album . very good .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

1	this is a song i could play over . it ha a great hook and i like it .
0	this is my favorite song on this list .
0	i love this cd . i have always liked this cd .
0	this song is about how he feel when she is cheating on him . the song is also about how he feel when he is sleeping with someone that he doe not really care about .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	the song is very nice .

1	: i love this song . i wish there wa more music like it .
0	very disappointing . i am not a jewel fan at all , but you are right , this song is terrible . it is a boring song which just keep repeating itself . i liked when she wa talking about her father in the first song . she ha a very nice voice and i would like to hear her sing a few song more . i do not know if i can get behind this album . i love all her other album , but this one is just so boring to me . i hope she get back with her boyfriend .
1	this song make me feel good . it is a great song .
1	i liked the song . i like some of the song she did in the old day . i like the cd she did with jerry .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this is a song for the wedding reception . it is beautiful and i think the chorus is very catchy . the song is very different , and very unique . it will be a hit .
0	he is back and again he come through with the good . the album is good , but i do not know if it is a masterpiece . it is a good album , but it is not my favorite . he is in a different time and place and i do not know if he is going to stay in that time and place .

0	this is the album from the artist named , who i have never heard of . i purchased the cd with the intention of purchasing the cd . i wa really looking forward to it , but it doe not live up to expectation . i expected more . the album sound like it ha been put together with a computer , and not a human mind . i would never listen to her music on my own .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this a really good song and you can listen to it without buying it , i have . but it is a good song nevertheless .
0	this song wa great .
1	i have seen this song on several occasion and it is always a favorite of mine . i love it , but i hate how it doe not appear to have any lyric ! ( the video doe have a little bit of the lyric , but even with the little bit of info , it would still be nice to have the lyric in the song itself . )
0	this is ok. i hope to see this band in the future . i like the band . the band is not very good and the recording is horrible . i will listen to this one when i am bored and can not find any other music . i will probably buy this one when i am bored and can not find any other music .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this is the only song on the album by sam sparro that i have downloaded . i liked the song , but the guitar sounded so much like the beginning of it is time to move on that it wa distracting .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this , but i think this is false advertising , not only because she sings like a robot , but also because there are a lot better song on the album , and i can not think of one that ha this kind of good singing .
1	this is an incredible collection of music that is very well done .
1	one of the best track on this cd . it is not very long but it is an excellent song . it is upbeat and nice . the vocal are great .
1	i am a fan of trance , and i have to say this is by far the most impressive trance album that i have ever heard . it is very enjoyable , and i like the way the vocal are mixed in there so that they seem to be coming from all part of the song . this is a very good album .
1	i love the song , and i really liked the video . i feel like i should have been there in the video singing . i love the melody and the lyric , and i think that the whole album is amazing .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	this is an amazing recording of beethoven fifth symphony . it is good to have a recording of it , but not on this level . i had listened to it so many time a a young child that i could play it perfectly from memory , but this is so much more beautiful , nuanced , and dynamic than anything i have ever heard . i am not familiar with anything that come close . for this level , this is amazing .
1	i bought this album based on the cd cover . it is amazing . it wa nice to hear e.s.posthumus again .

0	i bought this album after i saw a video on youtube of the band playing the song downtown and i wa hooked . this song ha a great message about being yourself .
1	good and relaxing version , but i like the movie version better .
0	this cover of the dave clark five the love of god is not that bad . the guitar work is good , and the drum are okay . the lyric are hard to understand . i am not a fan of their cover of other classic song , and i find this cover to be mediocre .
1	this is by far the best song i have heard from the cd . i wa looking forward to it , but i do not know what song she is talking about , but it is good . i like this song a lot , but i would like to know what song she is talking about , even better would be if i knew what song is about . this song is better than the entire cd , by far . i do not know if this is going to be a hit , but i am happy to have heard this and i hope she continues with music .
1	i love this whole album ! i am not really into r & b music and this is one of my favorite r & b album of all time . the song are very entertaining and i love the video !
0	i am not a prince fan , but this is a great album . the music is ok , not what he is known for .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .

1	great harmony super fourties group
0	i am not really a fan of the guitar player , but the guitar playing is nice . i would like to hear more of his work . i guess it would be hard to distinguish his playing from what is being played on the cd but i am sure you can make the distinction . i would really like to hear a new album . maybe a compilation of his song .
1	my favorite song of the new album ! and a good representation of the whole album ! i love the song !
0	i have not listened to the cd . i would not recommend the cd . i would not recommend the cd because of the false advertising .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i have heard this song played live , but then i have also heard this song played on the radio , and i have also heard this song played on the radio , and on several different cd collection . so it is not the same song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is the worst song i have ever heard of this band . i am so turned off by this band that i do not even bother listening to them anymore . i do not want to be associated with this band . they are a huge disappointment . and their music sound like a bad cover band from the 80 . i hope you do not ever hear another gnr song . i hope you know about this band . i hope you will forget about this band . i hope you burn this song into your memory . i hope you will never play this song on your radio station . i hope this song is forgotten about and this band is forgotten about . i hope you never hear this song again . i hope you never play this song again . i hope this song is never played on your radio station . i hope this band will never be heard . i hope you guy never play this song again . i hope you do not ever play this song again . i hope this band get no notoriety . i hope you all do not ever play this song again . i hope this song doe not get played on your radio station . i hope this song is never played on your radio station . i hope you guy never hear this song again . i hope you never play this song ever again . i hope this song get no notoriety . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . i hope this song get no popularity . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . this song suck . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . because i do not care . this song suck . i hope you guy never play this stupid song ever again . this song suck . i hope you guy do not play this song ever again . this song suck . i hope this song never get played on any radio station . i hope this song never get played on any radio station .

1	this is good . i like it .
1	this song is not only catchy , but it is the first song that i ever wrote . i am proud to have written it .
0	i liked the movie more than the song . i thought it wa a good song . i mean it is catchy , but it is annoying when i hear it too often .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd

0	this is the first album from a new band i have ever heard . i do not like it , but i will pas on it .
0	the only song i found to be really good were i want someone and why did you have to go ?
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	i love this music . it brings me back to a simpler time . great job guy . this song brings me back to a more simple time . great job !
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i do not think you can go wrong . if you like her music you will probably like this cd . if you are a fan of her music you will not like this cd . i would not buy this album . i do not think it is worth the money and time . i am not a fan of this artist . there are better artist out there .
1	my friend gave me this a a gift and i played it for him and he wa so happy he told me that it wa the best album he had ever heard . i agree , it is great . i do not think i could have been happy with the way the album sounded if i heard it for the first time .

1	the band sound great and the sound quality is great .

1	yes , i am a fan of this song , but i would like to see her perform it live . i hope she doe more .
0	i like him , i like his music , but i am not a fan of his singing . i know he is a nice guy , but i can not stand him . every time i hear this song , i have to turn it down to listen to a good rock song . his voice hurt my ear . i do not understand why he is still on the show , he is not even that good . i do not understand why he is still on the show , i do not understand why he is still on the show , i don .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i do not mind that they did not use the original song , so i will listen to it .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this is just a great song . i have been listening to

1	a collection of some of the more well known song from the legendary rock group : the beatles . many of the song on this compilation demonstrate the range of their musical ability from the easy rocker , to the more challenging and atmospheric song .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

0	tom scott on the other hand is not a good a he once wa .
1	i love this song ! i love bonnie . she is got a great voice . love the song .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	tom scott : a great album with great arrangement .
0	i love this song . it is so good .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	this is a really good album . i really like the production , i think it is great .
1	this is the first album i have heard by this band . i liked the album title , and i liked the cover art .
1	bonnie . love you bonnie . this is my favorite song . she ha a great voice , and a great guitar . i love her .
0	i love prince , but some of his music is atrocious .
0	barbra is a great singer and i like this album .
1	this wa one of the best song i would heard in a long time .
1	i think i love this song . it is very catchy and fun to dance to .

1	this is a song i love . you are my angel who come to me in my dream . i am so happy you are mine . you are the one who make my heart beat .
0	it is a love song with great lyric and everything , but i thought she sounded like she wa singing i want to be a rock star .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this album feature a group of singer and instrumentalist singing and playing jazz piano . i am glad i found this album because the song are really nice .
1	i wa in a bad place when i first heard this album . i wa depressed , and with no direction in life , i turned to drug and alcohol . i also used to listen to a lot of classic rock , so i put on all my life and all my life to drown out the noise .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i have been listening to this album for 3 week , i think it is the best new album i have heard all year . i think it is a great album . i like the song
0	i am a bit disappointed with the band and the sound quality of the song .
0	i bought this because it wa on the cd and i liked it .
1	i do not like this song .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i heard this song for the first time on the radio and i did not realize that it wa the first one by them . i love this song for that reason .
0	i liked the way we were but i do not think i would love this song .
1	i discovered this band on the internet . i am not a fan of this band but i like their music . i like the way they sing and the way they play the song . this is a good album .
0	i can not say i do not like this band , but i feel that the music is too generic for me . i think i will continue to listen to their music , but i just do not have much to say about it .
0	this album just doe not work for me . i do not understand why people would buy this album .
0	this song is definitely the best one on this album , but i do not think it is the best album overall .
0	i liked it . i have not listened to it in a while and i really enjoyed it . i have a few thought :
0	nice voice ; not very sophisticated ( for her age ) .
1	if you like frank sinatra , bing crosby , dean martin , or louis armstrong this is a must-have .
0	i downloaded this song . i got a message saying that the song wa downloaded , but the song doe not play on my iphone .
0	i wa looking for something to listen to while working out , and this is it .
0	not the movie version , but the original version of the song is not the same .
1	i really enjoyed this cd . it is good for kid . i like the song a lot .
1	excellent song , great for the holiday season .
1	this is a real shame . the record is an amalgamation of many style and era , from the blue to the funk , from early rock to modern pop , and everything in between . a true example of why jps album are so special , and why the quality of his playing on this one is a good a any of his other work . his playing is excellent , and his vocal is pure , emotional and soaring .
0	i am not a big guitar fan but i do like her song but i do not like everything on this album . the song if you go is the only song i like . if i could give her a positive review then i would give her a 5 star rating !
0	this cd is not bad . it is not great . it is mediocre . the cd is an unmitigated dud . it ha no redeeming value . the cd is the worst i have ever heard , and that includes all of the terrible cd ( i mean , for real ! i have never heard a real bad cd . ) it is mediocre . the song are terrible . the music is terrible . the music is the worst i have ever heard . it is worse than the rodeo song ( i do not even know what that is . )
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	this is one of the worst cd i have ever listened to . what the hell wa this cd made for ? it is just the same old song , for almost the entire cd . i do not understand why i had to buy this cd .
0	i do not know why i am even listening to this album . this album sound amazing , but i do not like this album . i can not imagine any of the song on this album being played on one of reo speedwagons other album .
1	i have only two word to use to describe this cd . wonderful . wonderful .
0	i listened to this and it is very good . the lyric are very inspiring and i am thankful we have been given this gift to be able to hear the word . the other song on the cd are not a good .
0	i tried to download this file , but it did not download . i am not the only one who had this problem . i have deleted the file by clicking on the delete button , but it still will not delete .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i just purchased this cd . the first song i listened to wa some good year and it wa wonderful . i loved all the song , but i really liked the song some good year . there is something special about the song and the harmony which sounded great to me . i thought it sounded like the kind of song barbra would write . i think the album is good and i will probably purchase the cd when i am able to purchase it .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	the music is amazing , and the lyric are beautiful . i have started listening to it more frequently .
1	i wa looking for something different , but i wasnt disappointed .
1	if you like the movie , then this song is perfect for you to sing . it is just the way it is supposed to be sung . i would recommend everyone to buy the cd . if you are a fan of the movie , then this song is perfect for you .
0	i have enjoyed her music for a long time . i like her song for the most part . my problem is with this album . the only reason i bought it wa because i enjoyed her music . what a waste of time and money .
0	this song doe not have any word . it is a great beatles song to sing along to .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	this is one of the worst song i have ever heard . i hate it . it is painful to listen to , and it doe not have any redeeming quality .
1	this song can not get any better .
1	i like this album a lot , the best of the bunch . i liked the ballad , the rock song , and the song that wa the least expected . i really like the song on this album , and i recommend this album . this is one of my favorite album .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i have to say , all alone with something to say is the best album by bonnie tyler . the other album are okay , but i have to say , this one is better .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	this song reminds me of the great thing that god ha done in my life . he ha blessed me with a lot of good thing and i know he can still do more .

0	this wa the only song on my father fm radio station that wa the top country song . i bought it because i liked it .
1	i love my dave clark five !
0	the album is decent . there are a lot of good song , but i do not like the music . the music is too loud and doe not flow like most christian music . i am not sure what the problem is . i do not think that the problem is with the cd . i think that the person who is reading the book is the problem . i think what the pastor should say is christian music is god gift to u , but we all need to be very , very careful when we listen to it .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i love jewelry . i love this cd . i have been a fan since the beginning . it is just a great collection of song .
0	this is a very different sounding album for me . i love the overall sound of the album , but it is pretty hard to describe , especially since i do not really know what i am on when listening to it . for me , it sound like there are many different style of trance in the mix , but i do not know exactly what is which .
1	the song is good , but the lyric are not very clear . i downloaded it so i could drive to work and listen to it .
0	this cd is very nice . i bought this album so that i could listen to it on my iphone during the noon nap . it is very relaxing . i would recommend it .
0	i like this music a lot . it is very bluesy and you can still hear the blue influence which i think it is very important .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i have to admit i really love the album . it is not often you find a band like this . there is a great variety of song and great musicianship . i hope the album make it on to the itunes store . it is really well done music . the song are jam packed with good emotion and the musicianship is excellent . i am sure it will sell well . the band may be gone , but the music is still with u . i am sure this album will go down in history a one of the best album of all time .
0	this is not an album jewel released . this is a cd jewel put out to promote her new record ( i still have the cd in my room ) . the new song are great , and i like the new recording , but it wa not released a an album . the only redeeming feature of the new song is the song i am a bird ( which is on this cd , in the liner note ) .

1	this is my favorite song on the cd . i love it . it is soo good ! i really love the song !
1	when i wa about 10 year old , i used to go through phase of i am gon na buy this album until the day i bought this album , which is in the closet . i had a hard time finding the cd a i went through my teenage year but when i came across it at a flea market , i quickly grabbed them and have spent most of the past decade getting up to speed on the album and being familiar with them .
1	great cover of a great show ! this song wa played on the tonight show during the show and i loved it . i wa listening to it in the car on the way to the show and had tear in my eye . thank you . i wish i could have bought the original album . i hope there are still people out there who have the good taste to buy this great cover . i am happy to be able to listen to it again .

1	this song ha a really unique sound and i love it . the guitar solo is great . i love the song and the music video .
1	i found this song on the internet and i have to say , i found it so beautiful that i purchased it for my own personal use and it just became my song now . it ha a very distinct beat that make your heart beat to the music . i would like to thank whoever put it on the internet for giving me a great song to enjoy .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	mileys voice is amazing . she wa a beautiful singer and it is unfortunate that she is not around anymore .
1	my wife and i have been listening to a lot of this album . it is so relaxing .
1	i like his voice . i would recommend this to anyone who like jazz and swing .
1	i love this cd . it is a musical journey for the listener and i am sure it will take the listener on a musical journey .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is one of the best album of the year . i love the lyric . i love the beat . i love the vocal . this is one of my favorite album ever . i have been buying this album since it came out . i am happy i got it .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	this is a good album to listen to if you want to know what the beatles sound like . it is all about the harmony . the music is great .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i like this album .
1	this is a great album . i love the song , the arrangement are great , and the production is great . i would recommend it to anyone . it is a great album , i guess . it is definitely not your typical trance album , but if you like trance , you should give this one a chance .
1	love this song . wish he would go back to his old stuff .
0	this song wa released in 1993. i do not really like this song . it is pretty bad .
0	this is one of my all time favorite song .
0	i like the music , but i just do not like the lyric . i do not understand them , i think they are silly .
1	i do not like this song and it make me angry and sad . i think it should be a radio station .
1	i love this song . it is one of my favorite song . i love the lyric . it is one of my favorite song .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i do not know what to say except that i love the album . the cd is outstanding and i have listened to it over and over again . i am not sure why i did not buy this cd earlier , but i love the song . this is my favorite record of the year .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i have the whole cd and i do not want to get rid of it , but it is a waste of time . it is a lot of old , old song that do not make any sense . most of them are about love and sex and drug and alcohol , and i can not stand them . they do not make any sense , and they are nothing like the song on the album .
0	i bought this album and i am very disappointed . all the song are very slow and i can not tell where the beat is coming from . i love prince , but all the song are too slow . i do not know what i wa thinking .
0	i have listened to all the gay trance album and this is the best one . the album is very good . the song seem to be very well balanced . i like gay trance . i like the gay trance series .
0	i bought this cd from amazon when they first came out , but i wa disappointed , because the song that wa on here wa so bad . it wa the worst song on the cd .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	i bought this cd on a whim . i think this cd might have some value in the long run .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . it ha excellent song choice . i love the song amazing grace , i will be there when you call , and in the name of the lord . i do not like that one song on the album , i am a man . however , i will listen to any album i can get my hand on , and i will not let that one stop me from buying this album .
0	this is the best album i have heard . i like it a lot .
0	this is an album i wa looking foward to buying . i have always loved r.kellys music and i wa anxious to hear what he could do with this album . however , this is not his best album . it is not what i expected . i do not know if it is his best album or not . i do know that this album is a little rough . it is not a smooth a his other album . i do not like it , but if i could be happy with just one album , i would choose this one . i also like the cover . it is unique and different .
1	i love i love this song . it really brings me to worship .
0	i received this cd to practice for a karaoke competition . it wa nothing more than a 5 minute recorded of a singer at a concert who did not know how to sing , and wa singing in a foreign language . the recording wa taken out of context and sold a a cd a part of a series .
0	do not think this is a good song
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i had to give it a rating of +1 ( i liked it a lot ) . i think it wa a good album , but it wa not for me . i am not your ordinary american is my favorite song . i would like to hear a more complete album with all the song , but i think that is too much work .
1	this album come highly recommended ! i am glad i bought it .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i have never liked the temptation , but this time i really like them . the music video is so beautiful . i thought that i wasnt going to like them , but i really did . i am glad that they are still singing . i wish they could still be around for my kid to see . i am glad that they are still on tour . i wish they could still be around for me to see . i am glad that they are still on tour .
0	this is a great song and the album is terrible !
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i have been looking
1	i love my i phone
1	i am new to the music business but i love this cd .
1	i think it is a great song . i do not really know if it is a hit or not , but i really like it . i only wish i had a better choice . i do not know if it is a hit or not . it is just a good song . i do not know if it is a hit or not .
1	i love this band , and i think that they were a big influence on my career . i discovered them a couple of year after i realized i wa gay . i discovered the dead when i wa 14 , and i am still listening to them today . some of the song on the wrecking ball are a little cheesy , but that is okay with me , i still love that stuff anyway !
1	john frusciante and the reo speedwagon boy did it again . i wa on a plane and heard this song on the radio . i am a huge reo speedwagon fan , and this song came on the radio while i wa waiting on a connection . i wa so excited to listen to it . i immediately turned to listen to the lyric , and even more excited when i heard them . i have to give thanks to john frusciante for writing this song . i wa not a fan of his previous work , but i have to say this is the best song i have ever listened to . i love it .
1	this is my favorite ohearn album .
0	i have been listening to jvj for about ten day now . i like the new album and i am thinking of buying the old album . i have not listened to the new one yet but i plan to soon . i like the sound of the new album better . i just do not like the way the lead singer sound now . i do not have anything against jvj but i just do not like this new singer . i do not know if i like this band or not . i am not really a fan . he seems to be playing his music too fast . i do not listen to that kind of music . i like the way the old singer sound . my cd player is playing better music now .
1	not too bad a song . nothing to really complain about .
1	i have been listening to this album in my car for month and month on end . it ha been a favorite for so long that i have been able to sing along with it without even realizing i wa singing . great album .
0	i am a little nervous to buy this , i live in the middle of the country . i have never bought a cd from amazon before . i have heard some good stuff on amazon before . i do not want to get this and then have amazon sue me for trying to do a review for my blog . i have not heard this one yet . it is not bad . it is pretty good . i am not sure about this one yet . i am not sure if it is a good a the other song on the album . i am not sure if i like this version . i do not think i like this version . i think this is a better version . i think this is a better version . i like this better than the grateful dead version . i think this is a better version . i think i like this version better than the grateful dead version . this is a better version . i think this is better than the grateful dead version . this is a better version .
1	love the song
1	i listen to this cd over and over . i am not sure i could explain why . i think it might be my favorite song on the album .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	a great version .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i listen to the dave clark five all the time . i really like their music .
0	it is a good song , but the song doe not really do what it say . but , if you like this song , buy it .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i love this band , and every album they have released . this wa my first time listening to this album , and i wa hooked within the first few second .
0	just another bad , boring , generic , commercial album from the eagle . the only good song on here is i want you back . it is a pretty fun song , and i do not think the eagle have any bad song on here . they have decent song , though .
0	i like this song ( mp3 file of i like that ) , with good sound quality and decent sound quality . a lot of people will disagree with me on this one , but i really like this song . i have heard this song before and i think it is a good song . this song is not bad , but it is not a great song either . if you like this song you will like the rest of the album .

1	good album , with a lot of new music added for the release . i would recommend it to anyone who like new music . the first track on the album , is a very good track , with a lot of interesting part . the rest of the album you can listen to on your own , a the music is well done .

0	this suck ! this is the worst song from r.kelly .
0	i like this song very much . the song is very good !
0	this is a great song , but , for me , it sound like it wa recorded in a home studio and not in a large hall . there are no vocal , and the song sound like it wa recorded with a 4 track recorder . this is a really good song , but my opinion of tom wait is that he is better when he is more vocal .

0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i think becky is right , it sound like a 12 year old playing a guitar . i mean what are they doing ? they obviously do not know what a guitar is . it is not like they are doing a cover of the edge but rather jvj . it is not the best of the gnr cover , but it is not bad .

0	this is an album i have been looking for for year . i wish i found this before jon lord and his band had to record their next album . the last album they recorded wa the best album they have ever done . this is a great album . but listen to the first track , you will understand why .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i am just disappointed with the music of this band . i do not like the song , but the album is really good . they have a few great song . however , the music is just not that good . i would have rather they have just stayed the way they were .
1	very nice cd , really help me to relax when i am stressed out especially when i can not sleep .

1	i like this album . i have heard it before but i just had to try it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and over and over and over again . each new song is different . i can never get tired of it .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i have only seen the fall from grace video on youtube . i can not believe a 5 year old girl would sing a song like that . i think she is so sweet and lovable , she doe not deserve to be singing about her ex-husband . i really hope she doe not sing that song in the future .
0	the song start off with a guitar riff played by the band and a spoken word interlude by bassist keith moon . it is a very short instrumental , but it is very , very well done .
0	it is a rock and roll song , but it is one of the best rock song from the 70 with a great beat . this song reminds me of the beat of your heart by the beach boy . the beat of this song is great and it is a great song to rock out to .
1	this is probably my second favorite song from this album . i listened to it a lot on the way to my last show . i am glad that the band is still around , although i do not know them and i do not think they are part of the best band of all time .

1	i am reviewing an album by a band that i actually like . i wa so glad that i did not read the review before i ordered this cd .
0	this cd is by far the worst cd i have bought . i have already spent more money on this cd than i have spent on any cd i have bought in the past . this cd is so bad that i had to listen to it twice to be sure i had not bought it . i am now thinking about going back to buying my music from the dollar store . this cd is so bad that i probably would have been better off if i had just bought a cd from the dollar store . this cd is by far the worst cd i have ever bought .

0	the recording quality is quite good with full orchestra and full choir . the performance is well done with a good amount of color added . the opening of the piece is a bit fast and jittery , but it settle down and the rest of the piece is in good tempo .

1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

1	wow ! i just bought this cd on the spot ! this is what i have been waiting for ! if you liked rise up , you will love this . it is way better than rise up , and way better than wet paint . it is like a completely different artist . his guitar playing is unbelievable , his voice is incredible , his songwriting is amazing , and the whole thing with his lyric and the way he sings them is just amazing ! i just cant imagine why anyone would do anything else but buy his music . jp is a great and talented musician . i cant wait to hear some of his new stuff .

1	i think this song is great . it is not offensive and the lyric are very beautiful .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .

0	i just bought this cd for christmas . the song are very good . the lyric are good . i enjoyed hearing a couple of them .
0	i have a wonderful pair of headphone that i bought for my wife who ha lost her hearing . the ear bud are working just fine but the sound quality is terrible . i have to turn off the cd player and run the volume button all the way down to get anything to come out of the speaker without it turning into static or a faint buzzing . i have spent the last year buying new speaker and new headphone so i will spend the rest of my life buying new headphone because this is the only reason i can hear anything and the last thing i need is to get a little hearing damage . i do not mean that i do not trust the new headphone but if this is the type of quality that i am buying this year that i am going to have to spend a few year with them .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	this album is amazing . it ha the best lyric ever sung by the best singer ever . this album is amazing .
1	i have just bought this cd and i am absolutely in love . a great recording . the chicago symphony orchestra is a great orchestra .
0	i wish i could give this album 5 star , but i think it is only 3 out of 10. the lyric are not very good and the song are unoriginal . the music is good , but very average . i do not think he should get a much credit a he did for this album , he basically just put a bunch of band together and recorded them . the album a a whole is not worth the price of the album .

1	i bought this cd and i would recommend it to everyone . it is not easy to find a cd that play like this .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	this is a very positive album . if you like the byrd , the stooge , and the velvet underground , this is for you .
1	i like this
0	this album is good but it doe not have the heart and soul of steve morse . there is nothing wrong with this album but it lack a little bit of sparkle .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

1	i have been listening to this song for quite some time now , and i think sam sparro is a genius . i really like this song . i think it is a great song .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	i thought the album wa good . not one song wa really all that good .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this is the best music i have ever heard . very good song and i love the music video too .
1	i have listened to all of jewel cd . i found her song to be very enjoyable . i find her voice to be very pleasant . i have heard her album , and this is a fine collection of song .
1	i am looking forward to hearing this song . i like the song . i like the lyric .
0	this is a classic rock song . great tune . i love the way he sings it .
0	this song is one of my all time favorite . it ha a great sing along chorus and i love the message of the song . i have it on my car and play it every summer . the message of the song is that god is always there and we can do anything we put our mind to . i have had the cd for a while and have never had it in my car . i do not know why i did not have it in my car . i do not know why i did not get it when i ordered it . i am not sure why i wa not notified when i ordered it . i am not sure why i wa not informed when the shipment wa going to arrive . i am not sure why i have not received it yet . i am not sure why it wa not sent to me .
0	i like this song but i do not think it is a really good song .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i love everything about this album , but some of the song are just plain boring to me . the song when love first is a great song , but there is no real life message . i like how the song is about giving love to someone , but it just doe not grab me at all . i am an older gay man and i am really looking forward to listening to this album again .
0	it is a country song . the vocalist doe not sing in a deep voice , so it is not a deep song . it is a good song that i am sure i will listen to on the album .
1	this is one of my all-time favorite song . i love the way that this arrangement fit perfectly with the original . the vocal performance by john kander is great . the sound quality is excellent . the lyric are great . this is a great recording .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i have never heard a recording of this music which i consider to be superior . s.e .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i love the music , but i think the song are very repetitive and boring . i just have a weak memory .
1	this is a great song . i do not have a copy of it , but i think it is a great song .
1	this song rock . it is a cover band . i will check out the first song .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i am sorry but i do not like this album . this is a really good album but i do not like it . the song are nice but they are not my cup of tea . i do not like the title either . but i loved the music video . it wa really good . i hope she will make more album and continue to keep u entertained .
1	this song rock , but the original song is even better . it is a great song and they are both great song . i am not 100 percent sure that she made the original version , but it sound like it . i do not know how old the original is , but i like the idea . i like the way she wrote it and the way the vocal are done . it is a good song . i am sure it is not original . but i like it and i think it is better than the original version .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i bought this album for my wife and it is great ! the song are very well written and well played . i have listened to this cd several of time now and have really enjoyed it .
1	i love it . i think it is one of the greatest song of all time .

1	this album is fantastic . i love the song on this album . i give this album 4 .
0	i tried it but it wa not very good . it wa ok , but not good . i would not buy it again . in fact , i would consider it a waste of money . i tried to listen to it without my ear bud , but i could not . it wa not good . i would not buy it again . i will just buy the cd of trucker and the cd of dancing with .
1	i do not know if i have ever reviewed this particular cd but i have read plenty of review . you can do a lot better purchasing the cd and listening to it . i can not tell you how many time i have listened to it while driving and it ha been very pleasant .
1	great album , great song . one of my favorite song is god love which ha a great message about how god love u and that he is always with u . other favorite include holy and behold . i am not sure why the title is inspirational . it is simply a great album . if you like christian music this is the album for you . there is some good music here but it is not a great album .
0	the album is about what happens in the life of a teenage girl , she tell you everything you need to know to get it . that is not all that it is , though . it is not just about a teenage girl , it is about life at all level . it is about the choice you make . it is about how you choose to live your life . it is about the decision you make . it is something i would like to share with you . that is all that i can say . enjoy .
1	i love this album . it is simply a masterpiece . this is my favorite collection of trance so far . this is not a bad album , but there is not much diversity to the tune or variety to the mix . it is a very good album and i would recommend it to all trance lover .
1	amazing album . even after spending hour in the studio writing it , i still found myself singing along to the chorus after it finished playing . i could have listened to it all day and still had the song stuck in my head .
1	i love this album . the song are great , the lyric are great , the beat are great and the overall song are great .
1	i think the instrumentals on this cd are great , but i think the vocal are overrated . the only good vocal performance is that of the main singer , marie . i am not a fan of her voice . i think that she is put on a good performance , but it doe not stand out enough to make me want to buy the cd .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	love the album ! it is cute and fun !
1	this is a great song ! i enjoy it . it is a good song to relax to . i am listening to it while i am doing my hair . you get the feeling of relaxation that you get from listening to music . i like the way the song flow and get you thinking about what you are listening to . it is a pleasant song to listen to . i am considering buying the cd .

0	this is a great cd ! i have it in a plastic case and it ha lot of great song . i am looking forward to getting the vinyl version .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this song wa fun to listen to . it is a good song . the lyric are a little bit funny . the video is cute a well . this song is a great dance song . i can not wait to see the video . i think it is a really great song . i love it .

0	this song doe not make me feel any different .

0	the song are good , but most of them are one dimensional . most of the song are good , but the three song that are not are very , very bad . the song are good , but the song are poor .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

1	i think that it is my favorite album .

0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	i am looking for a trance song that is very melodic and is not a much about the dance floor a this one . the song is very well sung and ha a lot of good lyric .
1	this album is incredible ! steve morse is a genius and the album is exceptional . this is one of my favorite jon lord album .
1	i am very happy that this album of hers came out . i can not think of any of her album that i do not enjoy .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

1	i love this band
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	the only thing positive about this album is that it ha a good amount of track . the album is not packed with a good amount of track , but it still ha a decent amount of good track . the track are nothing to write home about , but the album is worth a listen .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	some of the lyric were funny , but the rest of the lyric were boring . the guitar wa good , the vocal were ok , it all sounded a little too much like other band song . overall , i thought this wa an ok album , but i would not recommend it .
0	what kind of music is this ? this album sound like a bunch of idiot singing badly . it sound like a bunch of people who think i am talking to them . i really like this album because it is short , and you get to listen to it in an hour , so it is a good way to kill a weekend . i am not a big fan of this band , so i am not really sure why this one is here , but i am going to have to give it a shot . i have to see if it make me cry or not .
1	i am a big fan of song that make me feel a certain way . this song make me feel warm and fuzzy .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this album is great ! i will buy this album . it is got a lot of energy , and each song ha a great sound . it is got some unique beat and production that is different from the other album i have heard .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i am sure many of you have seen this , but i wanted to share my experience with the program . i downloaded this song last night and tried to play it on my window phone . i wa not able to get the song to play , and i am not sure why .
1	awolnation is a good song .
0	i bought this cd because it wa a live recording from a concert . i enjoy a live concert , so i bought this cd . it is really good . i would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys live music . it is very good . i give this album 4 star .
0	i have been waiting for her cd to come out . i have been a fan of her music since we heard her on idol , yet i am disappointed that she is no longer on the show .
0	i wish i could find a copy that i could play in the car .
0	this is my third reo speedwagon album . i have listened to them quite a bit and this is my favorite . i think they have one of the best voice in rock and roll today .
1	this is a good cd , i really like the music , but the only thing i do not like is the price . i think i will buy another cd .
0	i got this song for my daughter . it is definitely a favorite .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i have listened to this album once or twice and it ha been nothing but a waste of money . it is very dull and boring . the lyric are not that great either .
1	this is a pretty good cover of the song . i would give it a 6 if i were you . it is a pretty good cover of the song . it wa fun to listen to and i enjoyed listening to it . i do not have an opinion on the original song , and do not really consider this a cover .
0	i purchased this after seeing this review on the web . i wa very disappointed with the performance . i did not get the song , but it sounded very bad , with lot of background noise .
0	while i can not say i always agree with the opinion of rk , this album is indeed a great album . many of the song are great . i personally love love me like a man and hoodlum .
1	i have to agree with the general consensus , but i think the movie wa better .
0	this is the best song in the entire collection . i had to rip it off a cd i purchased at a garage sale to listen to it . the sound quality is excellent , the lyric are well written and well sung , and this song is so catchy . love this song .
1	i am impressed with the simplicity of this arrangement . this song is one that should have been recorded by the beatles , but they got it wrong - and rightly so ! the beatles have a great gift for making music that , whilst in every way simple , is also a challenge to the listener . this is one of those song that you can hear a million time and never tire of it . i am also impressed with the lyrics/melody - both of which must have been inspired by the beatles , a there is a great deal of similarity in the two . the beatles version is , however , somewhat short on the piano solo , which make it a bit of a letdown . this could have benefited from a more detailed piano solo by the author of the song , who would have found such a thing to be quite challenging . it would also have benefited from the inclusion of , say , a saxophone solo by either one of the beatles or by someone other than a piano . this would have created a more complete piece , one which is a bit more exciting and more adventurous . the lack of this mean that i can only listen to this song , for quite a long time , without ever getting bored of it . the song is a great one , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i have pre-ordered this album . i love miley cyrus music . i will be buying the cd and i will support her with my money . i love
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i am a sucker for song with an intro and outro , that is all , except for distant drummer and i am on fire ( on which i am a sucker ) .
1	this wa one of the first album i bought ( in the late 80 ) . it wa one of the first song i played on guitar . i can not believe the last time i played this song wa when i wa 13 and i wa listening to a cassette copy of it . it is so very cool . i wish there wa a better recording . i still listen to this song quite often . i think it is a must have for any guitar fan .
0	i think this is the best cd i have ever listened to .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this song is ok but it is not really a great song .
1	this is an awesome song . i love it . i have tried to find it on the internet but i could not find it . i searched many web site and it wasnt there . i finally found it on youtube . i have heard it on the radio many time and i loved it .
1	great song to sing to .
0	i like the way she sings this song .

1	i think it wa the perfect song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i love music . i love this song . i can sing along to it all day .
0	just love lareine . i am amazed every time . her music is so amazing . it make me feel like i am listening to someone else .
0	i do not think this is a good album . i would have liked to hear more of the music that wa on the cd .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this is the best trance ever .
0	the cd is a candy for the jazz lover , but it is a lot of junk like a candy for the rock and pop lover .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i am sorry this version of the song is so terrible . i do not know what the hell happened between this version and the live performance .
1	great compilation of music from the 20th century , from the great like beethoven , stravinsky , mozart , and bartok .
1	this song wa pretty cool .
1	it is great . i like it and i like it a lot . i am surprised i have never gotten this album for free .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	this is not an improvement on the original . it wa one of the song that wa ripped out of the movie , and you can tell the movie maker did not want it sung in the movie .

0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i like the album . it is very good .
1	this is one of the best cover i have ever heard . i love the song and you managed to get the artist right . i am excited to buy this cd and listen to it a lot .
0	this is good for playing on the computer , but it is not good for listening to . it ha some good song and a few mediocre one . i do not think this should be on a used cd player .
1	this is a great album . i love it . i have been a fan for a long time .
0	i think the song is pretty much perfect for this movie , and i also think that the movie is well worth it and that the music fit the mood perfectly . the movie is about a father who go to a concert in which a guy who wa an astronaut and a musician get killed so that his wife doe not lose her job . the wife , who wa also an astronaut , is heartbroken over what happened and decides that she is going to get drunk and become a recluse to escape the pain . the father and his wife go to the concert and get drunk , and the father is killed when he fall off the stage . the mother dy of a heart attack in the bathroom and the father wife dy in her apartment .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is my favorite hammond album , ever . i bought it on the recommendation of a friend , and i am glad i did .
1	i like the song when i hear it in my head . it is pretty simple and catchy . i like the song and the video too . this artist is an amazing artist . i will be checking out more of his music .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i am a fan of reo speedwagon . i had no idea about the band until a few year ago . i wa introduced to them by my friend who is a huge fan . i have always enjoyed their music . i wa hoping they would record more album . they are going to do a reunion tour next year . i am looking forward to it . this is a great cd .

0	this is the worst live album i have ever heard . the band is not very good and the recording is horrible . it is a waste of time . i hope to see this band in the future . i will not buy it again .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	cd is good , but i thought the cover work wa a little odd . can not use it a a coaster . the music is decent . i will be using it a a coaster .
1	i have a cd called jesus , i love you and one of my friend gave me this cd and i have been listening to it all day . i like it very much . i like it better than any of the other cd i have . but i have other cd that i like more . i can not stop listening to this one . i feel like i am listening to a parody of myself . no offense to anyone , but i am an old woman , and my friend would like me to give her a cd . i like the cd . i like how you all have written in a positive way about e.s . posthumus . i have tried to find a review of this cd for you all . but it is so hard to find the review . i would like to hear your view . please write a review of this cd .
1	i love this album ! it is sooo good ! when i wa a kid i loved listening to country music .
1	i have to say that e.s.posthumus is one of the best death metal singer i have heard .
0	i really , really like this cover . it is different , it is different , it is different , but it is not awful , and it is not great . i will be buying the original .
1	i have been waiting on this cd for a long time . i have listened to it a much a i possibly can . this is by far my fave cd from hasselvander . love the song do not do this and the song what it is all about are my faves . i could not stop listening to this cd all day . i like how hasselvander is a musician and not a singer .
0	this album is not a christian album ! the only christian song on this album are the song that the artist ha added . the rest of the song are completely commercial and have nothing to do with the gospel . you buy this album and listen to it , and you will be bored . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
0	i have tried about six different cd to get this on my ipod . i have tried about four different cd player and none of them can get this cd to play on my ipod . it is also very hard to find . this is a waste of time and money .
1	this is an excellent jazz album . the band is very good and the music is very good .
0	i do not know how many time i have listened to this album and i still have not gotten over the fact that it wa the wrong album .
0	i like the music of the gay trance series . the music is very good . the lyric are good . this album is very good .
0	i have a few of these in my collection . the music is very good , but the lyric are a little confusing . i really like the video .
1	i love this song !
0	this wa a terrible song , it is so bad , i think it is a cover of it is a dang shame by the pointer sister . i have heard this song many time before on other song by different artist , and it is really annoying when a song suddenly end with totally lame song end . allan bole
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	this song wa a very popular song for a very long time . it wa a favorite of elvis daughter , who recorded it for the soundtrack of the movie blue hawaii . it wa a hit for johnny mathis . it wa a major hit for billy joel , and for the beatles . this is a very popular song .
0	i love keith richards . i am sure he will be successful . i am sure he is not overrated .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i will be honest with you , i wa not a huge fan of whitney houston . i mean , i like her music , i even like her video . i just could never get past the whitney houston i will always love you and i have nothing song .
0	a terrible , terrible version of this song - i have to use the computer to listen to it . it is a bit slow and there is no rocking at the start and end of each verse , which is what make it even worse . and the opening riff sound like someone ha gone to the studio with a piece of wood and beat that up to sound like this .
0	i actually do like the dave clark five . most of their song are good , but this song is not one of them . it is really bad . i will listen to this song over and over and over . i also like most of their song . this song is just really really bad .
0	i have wanted to get this cd for a long time and i have finally been able to order it . i am disappointed in the quality of the cd and the quality of the audio . i have had to return the cd and i will be returning it .
1	this is like the best trance ever , and i highly recommend it . i love the sound quality .
1	this album ha a lot of good song that i thought were pretty good . the album also doe have a few song that i thought were rather boring . i would have to say that i would recommend this album to any fan of christmas music .
0	very good recording for the money .
0	i did not get this album because i do not like her music .
0	i have tried to buy every one of these album ( except the first one ) on cd . i could not find them anywhere . i can not believe this album is out of print . i can not even find it on the web .
0	if you want a really good trance song that is a little different from the norm , this is it . very good , but it doe not change my opinion of this album . i am hoping they release a 3rd part of the album soon , because it would be worth it .
0	this is not a good song . i do not care for it .
1	if you like the song on this album you will love this album . i love the song on this album . i like the song on this album . i like the song on this album .
0	i would recommend this album to a friend , but i would not go out and buy it myself . i like her album one more day , but the song on this album are too repetitive .
0	i can say that i have listened to this album several time , and when it is good it is really good . i love all of the song on this album , they are just a little bit average . i have listened to the entire album numerous time , and every time i listen to this album i expect a masterpiece . but every time it disappoints me . i think that the music is great , but somehow it doe not work for me . i feel that the music should be more dynamic , there should be more variety , but in the end it just doe not work for me . i would recommend this to others , but i would avoid this album if you are expecting a masterpiece .
0	this is my fourth purchase of the jewel cd all by myself . this cd is wonderful . it ha a great message , song , and great singing . all the song are wonderful . i hope you enjoy listening to these . i do . i hope you enjoy listening to this cd .
0	i liked some of her song . i have heard a lot of her song . she is the best .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	this song ha been covered by several artist , but i personally like this version better . however , the vocal are just not right for this style of music . this song is well produced and arranged . it is a nice song .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i like ( mp3 file of love me like a rock ) , with good sound quality a well . a lot of people will disagree with me on this one , and it is a great song . this song is a little different from the other song on the disc , but it is not bad , so i am happy to have it .
1	this song is great !
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i really like this song and have had it since i first heard it . it is a great song . i like it on the cdr . i have had it for a couple year now . i really like it . the only thing i think could be improved is the vocal . they are not bad , but they could be better .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	i love the way the app keep my son focused .
0	i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	when i first heard this song , i thought it wa great . it wa fast and i like fast music . just when i thought i like it , the singer went into a deep voice that reminded me of the voice of a child . then the voice changed to a deeper deeper voice and i thought the song wa over . it sounded like someone wa singing in a church . but then it got better . that second part wa the best part . the rest of the song wa good but after that , i did not like the song anymore .
0	i liked this cd , but i had problem with the cd player . the music wa fine , but the cd player wa very noisy . i am hoping the sound quality will improve .
0	i think i like this band more than most
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i think i enjoyed the last record but this one is ok
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	this is an old favorite of mine . i love the guitar part . the song is really catchy , and i can not wait to play it every time i hear it .
0	this is not a bad album but not a much a i would have liked . i also do not like that it is a re-recording . it would have been more enjoyable to hear the original .
1	i am so glad you put out another album . this is one of my favorite album .
0	what a wonderful life by dolly parton . this wa purchased for my niece for christmas and i am glad i did . the song are great and the cd is very enjoyable . however , the packaging is so poor that i have returned it . the cover is ugly , the cd is loose , the sleeve are so dirty that i have asked for them to be returned . the cd is $ 14.95 . i am so disappointed with the cd . i have already returned the $ 14.95 . i am only on my 4th cd . i have been on the internet to find this cd on some site . i had to email the company to ask the price . i will never buy another cd from them again . i am sorry , i am very disappointed .
0	this is probably the best radio show i have ever heard .
1	this song reminds me of christmas when my family wa little . i loved my mom and my family . it wa awesome and it brings back memory .
0	this song really made me think of my mom .
0	i love the first cd of the big lebowski . it is kind of like a big band version of the door meet the beach boy , that is until the vocal are over . this album is full of great song . i really love the song the ballad of andy kaufman . the other song on the album are also very good . and if you dig the movie , you should check out the soundtrack too . the movie is a great movie and the soundtrack will put you in the right mood for the movie . my favorite song is you are gon na miss it all . i like the way the band play jazz , blue and rock & roll . the band ha also released a couple of other album . the first one is called the big lebowski volume one .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	i did not know that i needed to know a few thing about music before i could listen to this album . however , i do . this is a well-crafted album that , for me , wa the first of it kind . the song are very good , the production is excellent , and the lyric are very well-written .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky

0	i do not see how this is an album at all . there are no song from the point of view of a guy perspective . the music is very rock like with some acoustic guitar and a couple of synth track . i just do not see any difference between this and other rock album .

0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this song i am not a huge fan of , but it is
0	this is one of the worst song i have ever had the misfortune of listening to . i do not understand how this song is on the top 100 list . it is just stupid . it is not even a song . it is just a bunch of noise . i will be listening to this song for year to come .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	if you have not heard this album yet , then you have no excuse . this is the best release by this young group of young black men and woman in the past few year . the music is always great , and the lyric are always fresh . this album is a must have .
1	i have been a fan of sam sparro since i first saw his performance on american idol back in 2002. i wa impressed by his vocal range and his smooth and effortless delivery of song that were not only extremely well-crafted , but also were very emotional .
1	dave clark five do not disappoint .
0	i really liked the movie , but i really do not like the song .
0	this song give me a lot of hope .
0	just listened to the song . it is a great song , but it is very hard to sing . it is very difficult to sing without any word to sing . the song is truly wonderful .
1	i bought this album because i am a fan of the clash and i wa disappointed to see it wa a cover album . the album cover doe not sell it and the music doe not sell it either , but i bought it anyway . i have enjoyed listening to this album . it is a good mix of rock , and blue with some reggae and punk thrown in for good measure . the sound is great with very good production . it ha a good message . i have always thought that the band were one of the best in the industry and i am glad that i finally listened to their music . i am very excited to listen to their new album . i can not wait to buy it .
1	my favorite album of all time . i have listened to this record a lot . i like it a lot and i think it is the best thing out there .
0	i like this album and i like the song lilith by e.s.posthumus , but the album overall is boring .
1	this album got me through a rough period in my life . it made me smile .
0	the lyric of this album are very clever
0	this is a great collection . i just wish there wa a way to get the original vinyl album .
0	this song wa used in the movie pulp fiction . i wa wondering if the original version wa better .
0	i love this recording . it is a wonderful sound . i love the sound of this recording .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this is an amazing album . bonnie prince billy is one of my favorite indie rock artist . i love the way she writes , the melody and the song . there are not many indie band out there that can match her talent .
1	an excellent collection , with some great cut .
0	the theme of this song is a positive one . i love the way they make this song sound .
1	i like her song . i like some of her song .
0	i just bought this album because i like ohearn . i like music in general , but i do not like ohearn . ( i did not listen to all of his album because i did not have enough money to buy the one i wanted , and i already have a lot of ohearn album . )
0	i am not sure if this is the right place to post this , but i am gon na have to say it anyway . i do not know if this is the right place to post this , but i am gon na ha to say it anyway . i do not know if this is the wrong place to post this , but i am gon na have to say it anyway , since i do not know where else to put it .
0	a masterpiece , lareine is so talented and innovative . i just love her music .
1	i really love this band . i have been a fan of the band since i first heard them on the radio . i would love to hear more song from next album .
1	this one is a good song . it is definitely worth the money . you can even sing along with the lyric .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	a great album , that also suffers from lack of promotion . if you are a fan of trance , then this is the album for you ! the album is a mixture of trance and a bit of techno . the album is well packaged and easy to listen to . however , it is highly recommended to those who do not wish to be overwhelmed by trance .
0	i love this song because it is got such a great beat . i love the story on the side it tell about the love that wa lost between two people . i loved it when i wa a kid when i would come home and my father would be singing the song and i always thought wow , the song is just exactly what i want to hear at that moment in time . i think it is a beautiful song . the only thing i do not like about it is the video . the girl voice sound like a young girl . also the song end in the middle for some reason . but overall i think it is a great song .
1	this is a great song ! it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true believer of god and is always looking for a song that brings him closer to god . this is a song to listen to when you want to find a song and get closer to god .
1	i am an old fan of this song who ha been listening to it since i wa young . i love it and i hope it will stay in the top 50 .
1	i would highly recommend this book to anyone who like country music . it is a very well-written book , with many interesting fact about country music . i have not read it in year but i plan to when my child are older . my 12 year old like to listen to country music . the book is in the book category and wa my first choice . i would have given it 5 star if it wa in the poetry category . the only thing that i did not appreciate wa the fact that the author wrote the music of country music a country music instead of country music . i personally prefer the former because it doe not feel like everyone is a country music fan .
1	i bought this album on a whim because of the cover . i thought it wa by a band i had never heard . it is a very good live album . good song list though .
1	i love barbz . love barbz .

0	this album wa not an album by prince at all . it is a remix album by prince . it is not a prince album . that is why i put it on here .
1	the song is just amazing . i have listened to this song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and it still is the same song . the lyric are very well written and i can not stop singing the song .

0	i am not sure i like the remix , but the original is absolutely amazing . i downloaded the free mp3 because i wa going to use it for a country karaoke competition . i downloaded the free version because i read a lot of good review about it . i am happy with it . i downloaded it to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple . i only wish the artist had a facebook fan page instead of just a website . i love when the artist work is posted on facebook .

1	i have had this cd for over a year now . every time i listen to it , i am in awe and am surprised at how good it is . this is one of the best jazz album that i have heard in a long time . the band wa not great , but they made up for it with the music . it is a very good example of the music that come from the south . while it ha everything , this is the only version of this recording that i have ever heard that ha a saxophone by the great sax player of the 60 , curtis fuller . this version ha a lot of nice guitar playing that i enjoy . i also really like the bass playing . the bassist is better than his counterpart on the original version . and the trumpet player is great . there is also a great saxophone part in the background of the first half . the trumpet player is better than the original version . his trumpet part is the best in the entire recording . the saxophone player is a great choice and he is probably the best trumpet player in the entire recording .

1	this cd of the who is saturday night live performance is superb . i have yet to hear a bad song on this cd . i do find that the recording sound a little low , but it is still a great recording . i love this recording because i like the sound of the studio .

0	this is a hard album to listen to . it start with an old theme and it just build on that theme- i can not really describe what i mean by that , i only know that it is a hard album to listen to for me . i think my favorite part of this album are the last couple minute of in the pocket . it just take me to a place that i have never been , it make me feel like i wa there and wa listening to a friend of mine who wa passing through .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i remember finding this cd on my brother-in-law shelf . i have no idea how he first heard it , but i am sure it wa in one of his first cd . when i bought it , it wa a one-off and i have not seen it since . the song my life is what struck me about it . i just could not get past it . i have always been a sucker for old-school , old-fashioned sounding pop music , and it is been a real struggle to get past the old song on this album . and it is not the weakest album in my collection , but it is not the best , either . i like some of the song and some of the lyric , but not all of them . and i am not sure why . i know the lyric are not great either , but i just can not get past them . i wa very lucky to get it .

0	i am a fan of the song all alone on this album . i love the lyric on this and the music is very pleasant . i wish i had bought this album sooner . i am glad i did not . the only down side to this album is the fact that the cd is on a very thin piece of cardboard , but even so , that is not a bad thing .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !

0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this is a good cd . it ha a lot of great song i like . the prince is a great musical artist . he wa a big influence on the music i wa listening to at the time . i like the fact that she used his voice and his instrument for the prince of denmark .

1	i like this song .
1	i wa on a plane from texas to ohio and bought this album to listen to with my headphone and it turned out to be the best music i listened to .
0	this song should be on a tv show .
0	i bought the cd because i am a big fan of the beach boy . i wa not expecting much for a beach boy album . i wa very pleased with the music . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i like this album . i love the song , the production and the musicianship is top notch .

1	this album ha it all ! just like my life !
0	the first time i saw the movie , i thought it wa about how the singer is a virgin but he is really a girl with a penis . but after watching the movie the second time the singer is in love with a girl , and he is not a virgin . he fall in love with her the second time he see her .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this is a great song . that is the only song i have ever heard from r.kelly . i have been a huge fan of r.kelly since i wa twelve year old when he released the single i believe . this song is not bad !
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i think this is a great album . i really like tom wait and i think he ha done great . i like it . i would like to hear it again . it is a great album . i would like to hear it again . i would like to hear this album again . i would like to hear this album again .
1	i use my cell phone
0	i bought this because i thought it wa a great album with great song .
1	this is a great , fun song ! the cover version is very different and i thought it sounded more like a parody of the original . i just do not really care for the original , much le the parody .
1	i have heard this cd on the radio a lot , and i like it very much . i wa surprised to find that it wa from the dave clark five . i had not heard about this band since i wa a young boy . i wa surprised to see that dave clark five ha not done another cd since i heard them on the radio . i am glad to know that they are still out there doing music
1	this is not a rock song . sam sparro is a great singer . this is a great , fun song . i love it . i have been listening to this for a while , and i have never heard it on the radio . it is great . i love it .
0	this song ha a great beat , but the lyric are weak . i give it a 3 star .
1	this is a great album . it is not perfect but it is definitely worth a listen .
1	i like this cd , i think it is a good mix of traditional and rock and roll . the vocal are not too bad , but the guitar playing is not that much better than the other band i have heard . some of the song are nice , but it is hard to argue that any of the song are very good . the instrumentals are nice and the vocal blend with the instrumentals very well , but they are not better than the other band i have heard . i do not know if i would have bothered listening to this cd if it wasnt for this one .
0	lareine is a true gem . they are extremely talented and i hope to hear their music more often
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i always had a soft place in my heart for the best punk band of all time , the clash . i grew up on music with a punk edge , and i had a pretty diverse taste in the early 90 . this album wa part of my early purchase of many i bought , and this album wa one of the first one i ever got to listen to . i still remember the first time i listened to this album , it wa just a casual listen at first , but a time passed i realized it wa a masterpiece in the making , a classic to a generation of people who still love music .
1	this is the best cd ever . a friend of mine bought it for me and it ha been a great help lately . i have been very depressed and need to get out of my funk and this cd is really helping me to do that .
0	miley is a very good singer and i love to listen to her sing . i love her music and i wish she would make more music .
0	i have to disagree with those who have not listened to this cd yet . the music is very relaxing and it is beautiful .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is a good song . it is a very good song .
0	this is a great song but the video is just a mess .
1	this is my first itunes purchase . i am really excited about it . i remember when i first heard it on the radio , i could not believe that it wa on the album , but then i listened to it and liked it . i hope you all like it .
1	this cd should be in every living room in the world .

1	i love listening to this song . it reminds me of i want you back by backstreet .
1	bruno mar sings this song very well during the middle of the song . bruno mar is a great singer .
1	this album is really good . i love the title track and the one that ha a great ending . the guitar work is good . the song is a little short . the other song are not bad , but they are not great . the instrumentals are great . this is a really good album with a couple of great song . i would give it a rating of a+ .
1	this song is a good song .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this album is excellent . the song are very good .
0	i am a huge fan of this song . i have purchased the original lighthouse version from the site and listened to it on and off for the past year . it is a very nice version . it is a very good song . i would buy the other version of this song from the site . the other version are pretty good , but they are not a good a the lighthouse version i own .
1	i love this album . i listen to it all the time . i have to listen to it every day . i listen to it at least once a day . i love the album cover , the song , and i love the album .
0	i believe that there are many , many people who have heard e.s . posthumus , but not all of them will listen to the cd . i like it , and i am glad i bought it . it is a good cd .
0	this cd ha some really good song , but the cd cover is very generic . the cd wa nice to look at and the song sounded very good , but not great .
0	i do not like the song , but it is pretty good .
1	love this cd . i have been putting this cd in my car and listening to it in the car . it is a very upbeat , fun cd and i like it . i would say it is a little more mature then typical uptown funk music .
0	this is the first cd i ever bought . i wa really impressed with the sound quality , but the cover art and the song name made me believe it wa a bootleg . it wa the first cd i ever bought . i wa hooked after listening to it . it wa a great cd . i just wish the title wa spelled correctly .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	the dave clark five were one of the first band to create a live rock band sound , and there is still a lot of it to be mined in the 50s-60s . the guy are a great live draw and they recorded many great song . this is one of my favorite from the era . the band wa a bit more polished and le loose , they still have that live rock sound . this is the best version of the song i have ever heard . i would listen to every version of this song over and over again . it is so infectious . i would buy this cd , i would want to own every one i could get my hand on .
1	very catchy , great sound and video .
1	a wonderful song .
0	i listen to this album all the time . i am a fan of the dave clark five and enjoy their music . i like the song and the music . i would like for this to be released on a cd that is not this offensive . robert
0	her vocal are good . she is a good singer . she wrote some good song .
1	i love this cd . it is so fun to listen to , and it is very easy to dance to .
0	this song had a good start but it wa all downhill from there .
0	i think this song is a total fail for her . it is a very average song and she is not very good at music . plus , she make a lot of very very bad ( for her ) lyric and that really ruin it for me .
0	the album is good , and i do like a few of the song . i hate what happened to the band , but i still like the music . if you are looking for a real album , i would suggest live at the opera house . it is actually great .
0	i think lareines voice is great . he ha a pretty good voice , but sometimes it sound a bit too deep for me . i have always liked his voice , but i like a lot of people voice that are deeper . i like a lot of people voice that have a lot of vibrato . i really like his voice because it doe not sound too deep , which is what i like when i listen to other people voice . i have a problem with deep voice because i feel like i am going to have trouble telling when someone is talking .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i have purchased this cd several time before i found it on sale a few month ago . i have always loved her music and this will be a very special christmas album to have in my collection .
1	i do not know where i got this song , but i like it .
0	i like this album . i do not like it all that much , but i like it . i like the lyric , and the music . it is a good album . i do not like the song that i do not like . some of them i do not like at all , but i like them . i do not know why . i do not know what it is about , but i just do not like some of the song . it is a good album though . i like jewel . i do not know what it is about , but i do not like some of the song . i like the lyric and the music .
0	i have to agree about the dave clark five . i did not find them to be my favorite dave clark five . maybe that is because i do not know too many of their song . i am guessing i am not the target audience for this cd . the song are all about love and life , and i am not a christian . i will have to give this one to my 10 year old who is already listened to this cd more than a dozen time . i am sure he is heard them all before , and will be happy to hear them again . i will give it to my wife , who know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . i am sure she will appreciate it . i will give it to my brother-in-law , who is never bought a cd before and is really looking for a new favorite . i am sure he will love this one . i will give it to my sister , who know what i am talking about , and know what i am not . she will probably be disappointed , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my mother-in-law , who is looking for something to listen to that will not offend her . she will appreciate the fact that this is music to listen to instead of music to watch . i will give it to my sister-in-law , who is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . she will probably be angry , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my brother-in-law , and he is looking for a great cd to listen to after church . i doubt he will enjoy it , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my sister-in-law , and she know what i am talking about , and she know exactly what i am not . she will probably be angry , and will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my sister- in-law , and she is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , but will resent it anyway . i will give it to my cousin , who is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . she will probably be annoyed , and will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who have already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who know exactly what i am talking about , but know exactly what i am not . they will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my cousin , who know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what he is talking about , but know exactly what he is not . she will probably be annoyed , and will appreciate it anyway , because they have heard it , and know exactly what they are talking about , but they know exactly what they are not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who already know exactly what i am talking about , but know exactly what they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway , because they have already heard it , and know exactly what they are talking about , and know exactly what they are not . i will give it to my cousin , who know exactly what he is talking about , and know exactly what he is not , and know exactly what he is not , but he know exactly what he is not . she will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway , because she already know exactly what she is talking about , and know exactly what she is not , and she know exactly what she is not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who know exactly what they are talking about , and know exactly what they are not , and know exactly what they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but they will appreciate it anyway , because they already know exactly what they are talking about , and they know exactly what they are not , and they know exactly what they are not , and they know exactly who they are not . why would they be annoyed ? i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who already know what they are talking about , and already know exactly what they are not , and already know exactly what they are not , and they already know exactly who they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but they will be happy anyway , because they already know exactly who they are talking about , and already know exactly what they are not , who already know exactly who they are not , who already know exactly who they are not , and they already know exactly who they are not .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	they put out another album called distant world that is not bad , but i just do not like it .
1	very entertaining ! the lead vocalist is very good , and the band member play a great mix of different genre . there are a couple of song that i really did not care for , but overall , i am actually really glad i bought this album .
0	i love the song . this song is a great song . i hope it come out on cd/dvd .
0	i wa so excited to open the cd because i had heard that it wa one of the best album of the year . i wa happy when i heard the song and the album wa really good .
0	this is the way i remember ohearn . it is a good album , but i have always felt that the production wasnt a solid a that of others in the same genre . that said , i found it to be a lot of fun ! the song are fun and the instrumentation is great . it is also very well recorded . i do not know that i could make it through a whole album of this . i like the first few song on this album .
1	i bought the cd to listen to in my car . i love it !

1	this song reminds me of something i had heard year ago . i am not sure what . i have no idea . i am not sure if it wa a band or a pop group . but i thought it wa a great song . i am not sure if it wa a commercial or a demo . but i will never forget what i heard . i hope that there is a song of this song on a cd or a cassette tape somewhere .
1	i love this song i bought it and put it on my ipod so i can listen to it when i play a song in my head . i love it .
1	this is a great song . i agree with previous review .
0	i like her voice , but she sings in a few of her song too fast .
0	i wa a massive eye fan when i wa in high school , and i wa disappointed when i first heard this album . so i got the old lp and enjoyed it . a i got older , i saw the movie and the album and wa blown away . it ha a great rhythm section , great arrangement , and is a great soundtrack for a live performance .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	this is their worst album ever . it is boring , it is repetitive and the lyric are lame , and they are really just bad . they have the worst singer ever and i do not think the song have any substance . i have already had my money wasted on this album . if i could give gnr some shit i would . they are horrible . they put out some horrible music . they suck . they use a lot of the same singer over and over and over again . i am not a gnr fan . i hate them . i hated jj jam but i still bought it . it wa good . they make this album and i do not like it .
0	this is absolutely the worst album i have ever heard . it is like someone made a copy of the cd and then went to great length to make it sound better . the vocal sound like there is a guitar behind the singer , not in front of her , and the melody is all over the place . i tried to listen to the song in order , and some song were still on the same track , but some were just looping endlessly . i have to say , the only positive thing about this album is that it is the only album i have ever heard by this band that ha a great song .
0	the first half of this cd is a little disappointing , but the final half wa great .
0	what a great song , and a great cover . it is a shame the studio version is so short . robert
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	just received the cd in a nice case and the case wa cracked . i will be returning this cd in a case . the cd is clear and in a nice case . i would recommend anyone to get the cd in a case .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i have heard this song a few time on the radio , but have never seen this song played on any television show or album . i like this version more than the one i have heard so many time before . this is actually the first time i have ever heard the song sung by a woman .
0	she is an amazing singer .

0	i have been a fan of tom wait since the 70 . i have seen all his movie and his solo stuff . it is nice to see tom wait play for a crowd . i can not say anything negative about the song . i am a fan .
0	reo-speedwagon is the best . i like them , and they are my favorite .
0	i first saw the band live at the big rig ( a bluegrass jam festival ) and they blew me away . i have been a fan of this band ever since . this band is awesome and i will continue to buy ( and listen to ) their cd . the music of the band is amazing . if you love 80 rock and metal i would recommend this band to you .
0	the song is wonderful , but the video is just not good enough . the singer in it is so unattractive and it just make the whole thing feel fake and cheap . the video is made like a tv show where the actor pretend to be someone else .
0	i agree and i can sing this song with my heart . it is a great song . i like the beat too . it is a great song .
0	i love this album . i have listened to it several time . there are also a good amount of good song on here , but there are also a lot of really really bad one .
0	i got this album for my birthday and it really got to me . i think i have heard the whole album but i wa listening to it on shuffle . i really enjoyed this album . this album is really good . i got this album for my birthday and it really got to me .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i have listened to this cd a lot and i am really enjoying it . if you are looking for a very good acoustic album to give to a friend , then this is an excellent choice .
0	the best r & b music .
0	i bought three book from amazon . it arrived today . the cover art is beautiful . the music is good . i will make good use of it .
1	very easy to sing along to and the melody is so catchy . it is like a little ballad . i really like this song .
1	i have been a fan of this band for a
1	they are fantastic .
0	this song doe not sound like it wa written for miley cyrus . it doe not sound like her music , or even like her voice . it sound like someone who is very good at singing , but is not really very good at anything else .
0	i have listened to this cd a lot and love the message in it . i even like the song on this cd . but i hate how much the song cut off at the end of the song . the song is short . it is not a song that one can really get through . the people that i play this cd for do not like it either .
1	i love the dave clark five ! i wa looking for a cd and i found it here . i am a fan of all your music .
0	i saw it . i thought it wa very good . i thought it wa a good show . i just did not have any energy left in it , which is a shame .

1	i am a fan of the dave clark five . i have purchased all the album on your site and they have all been great .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i can not remember the name of the song , but i love it . it is so simple but so effective . a great christian rock song .
1	this song is a fantastic song and video .
0	this is by far the worst version of this song i have ever heard . there is no way this is even close to what the grateful dead recorded for it . i would never recommend this version of this song to anyone . this version is terrible . it is one of the worst version i have ever heard in my life .
0	i have purchased this cd twice . i love the song , but i think that the cd cover art is very generic and the layout and layout are not well done .
0	there is a lot of good music out that i like but this song is too repetitive for me to listen to over and over again .
1	i bought it to listen to it but when i opened it the cd wa cracked . it is now in a new case . it ha now passed the crack test and i am very happy with it .
1	the pogues are the best band in the world . your cd is a great gift . thank you for the music . the pogues are the best band in the world . your album is a gift . thank you for the music . the pogues are great . your album is great . thank you for the music . the pogues are great ! your cd is great . thank you for the music . the pogues is great ! the pogues are the best band in the world . your cd is great . thank you for the music . the pogues music is great . your album is great . thank you for the music ! the pogues is great ! the pogues is the best band in the world . your cd is great . the pogues is great ! the pogues is the best ! the pogues are great
0	this is the first time i have purchased any of john williams music . i have listened to several of his album and this one is not very different . i am not a fan of the beatles either .

0	i really like this album . the song are great , the lyric are very clever .
1	i love it ! the song i want to be with you can be classified a r & b or pop depending on the context . i think it wa written by a male to male couple . i think it is good .
0	this song just doe not flow together . it is a typical pop song with generic music .
0	this is a new release by the dave clark five . it is very good .
1	a great album . the beatles are one of the best band ever .

1	i had been looking for some new music for year . i found these guy on ebay and am very happy with my purchase . they are very talented . i love their music .
0	i really enjoy this show . it is about a jewish man who try to understand his grandfather by looking at his life . it is a very deep show , and i enjoy the actor very much . i do not know how they go on stage so often . i will not be seeing it again though . i think it wa a great show , but there just wa no energy left in it .
1	i wa not a big fan of this cd . i found it to be a very pleasant , relaxing , and relaxing music .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	this song is not my favorite , but it is a great song that i have listened to over and over again .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	this song made me feel like i wa on a spaceship .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	the music for the video is a little more interesting than the song . the video of the band performing these song is entertaining and somewhat interesting . however , i found the accompanying music to be a little too generic and boring for my taste . the song good feeling from the album is the best song on the album . the song all i really need is decent , but not especially great . the other song on that album are also good , but not great . i really do not know what to make of this album . i am not really a fan of this type of music .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	the recording of the beethoven fifth symphony is truly exceptional . the quality is excellent , and the performance is also superb . it is really hard to describe the quality of this recording . the sound is very clear and very detailed . the music is just outstanding . a good recording of this piece would be hard to find . this is the best i have heard .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !

0	i love all of the music on this cd , but i will be honest and say that i do not love the vocal of this cd . yes , they sound great , but the singing is just very off putting . it is almost a if the singer is singing through a tube , or being played by a machine . i can not wait to hear what is on the next cd . i love the variety of artist on this cd , but the vocal of this one just make me cringe . i do not know if i will buy this cd again , but i will be listening to it a lot .

0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

0	when i listen to this song i get the feeling of sitting under a big umbrella with a drink . it is an enjoyable song but it definitely make me think of summer and sitting under a big umbrella with a drink and a few friend .

0	i am a huge chris young fan , so i wa excited to have a copy of his new cd , love can not wait . i have to say that i do not think his cd is a must have , but i think it is a good cd . the only song i did not like were the one that have that he is just a singer feel to them , but there are some good song on the cd . some of them are very good . the only thing i do not like about the album is that it ha a very annoying song on it called i will be your woman that is a good song , but it sound like a remix of the bee gee song money ( that is what i want ) it is just annoying . i am not going to try to change the song , if it is there i will listen to it , but i have to say that i do not think it is very good . the album is good , but i think it is better a a single . i have to say i have heard only 2 song from the cd that i like , and i think the other song are all good , but i do not remember the name of the song i liked on the cd . it also ha a very short story on it called i have no word , which is very short . it is very short and i think it is a very good story , but i have to say that the song i liked on the cd , take me away is better , the song is good but the story is terrible
1	i love this album . i love the song . i love the musician . i love the message . the song are very well sung . the singer are very well written and they have a great message . i have listened to this album a total of 4 time , and i like it every time . it is a great album for worship and praise .
0	this song will be my favorite on the cd . i like it a lot . the video is not that great . i think it would have been better if she did a duet . i think she should not do a duet because i think people can tell that she is just singing to be popular . she should lip sync because she lip syncs all the time .
1	i am a huge fan of tom scott and his music . i really like his music .
1	this is my favorite song on her next cd , which come out in 2011. it wa also on her first cd . it is a great song . she is a great singer and an amazing song writer . tom wait is a great musician who can make a song sound like anything . this song is great .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i found this on a youtube video channel . it is a very good trance track , but this is not the same a the original . the original is much more melodic and is more appropriate for trance . this new song is very similar , but still is not the same a the original .
1	i have been listening to this for many year . i can not describe how much i love it or the way it make me feel . the music is great , but it is the sound that make it great . the sound , the production , the vibe , it is something . i have always loved the sound of this album , it sound like the music is being played on the same track , but it is not , it is just one big track , that is just so good , and there is just something about it that make it so special . it is very very good .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i love bonnie raitt . i have been listening to her music for year . i bought her album bonnie raitt this year for my girlfriend . it is great !
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

0	i purchased this album in order to find out what to do with my aging cassette player . i heard this album on the radio and knew i had to have it . the song the best thing that never wa is my favorite song on the entire album . i think the album is a good mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in . i enjoy the song hound dog a lot . the album is a great mix of rock , punk , and new wave .
1	i have heard a few recording of the beethoven piano concerto no . 5. this is by far the best . it is also the most accurate . it sound like the symphony actually ha a lot of life . this is not a fancy recording . it ha a very good sound quality .
1	you need to listen to this song . it is so beautiful . it is a very important song . a a teacher , i believe that the greatest challenge in a classroom is to learn from the lesson of the student . i think this song is a great teaching example of how to learn from the lesson of someone else .
1	i have been listening to this album from time to time and i usually find it much better than most of the dave clark five album . i really think this album is worth the money because of the great song that are on it .
1	a a fan of david bowie , i wa thrilled when i saw that david bowie album , the next day , wa available for digital download . i wa even more thrilled when i saw that the album wa available on the itunes store . however , i wa disappointed to find that bowie album wa available through itunes only , and not through the digital download option found on amazon . i found a few song on itunes , but i am not sure they are available in the online download section . i wa disappointed ; but still very much looking forward to the digital download option .

0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is definitely one of the worst album of the year . i give it an 1 because there are only two song worth listening to ( and the other song are just dull ) . the production is not that bad . the song are really good and not very generic . the production could be better . the production could use some work , but the song are nice and it is a fun and interesting album .

0	a great album , but not worth the price . great production with great song , but the song did not match up to the quality of the production .
1	this album is good . i bought it to listen to when my wife and i are in a hurry .
0	this is just not worth the price . i will save this because the black and gold album is awesome . the only reason to listen to this is to get the rare classic package . this is a bad waste of money .

1	great album , it is very good , i like the song my love , my love , it is cool to have this album , i like a lot in this . i think it is a great album .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	one song on the cd is not worth the money . the worst song on the cd is the only one on the two cd that i have . the cd are also not worth the money . they hold up very well .

0	his last concert took place in toronto , canada , on november 24 , 1979 .
0	i am a tom scott fan , but i have to disagree with the others here . this is far from the best tom scott album . i think this one is just ok , but not bad at all . the vocal are ok , but not great . the lyric are cute and fun . the music is fun , but not great . the song are ok , but not amazing . i would recommend this album to any tom scott fan . the album is ok , but not great .
1	this is a nice light and relaxing song . i like it , and it is pleasant to listen to .
1	i think this album is great ! i love it !
0	i wa at the record store and wa looking through this set and saw a small booklet of this record . it wa really interesting . i wa a little disappointed to find out that the first six album were on vinyl . i am glad that i bought all six .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	i do not know what the song is about , but i love it ! this is the song i use in my car when i am driving . it set the mood for my drive to work and i never tire of it !
1	i have been listening to this song on repeat for the past month . it is my new favorite . i love the lyric .
1	this album just amazes me . every song on this album is amazing . the only thing i can compare it to is a very good movie . the song are the best so far . if you love this album , then you will love this album .
1	i think this is the best album of tom wait . it ha no filler or unnecessary track . it is a solid album , a good listen .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	this album is a great listen , but the song that people are saying are over-produced are some of the best in the band catalog . i do not like how some song have the same note repeated , and i think it ruin the song . the best thing is that this album is a good mix of song .
0	it is a tough one . i have listened to this cd a number of time and each time i have the same reaction . it is good , but not great . but i do not think it is a bad cd , a good a it is , it is not great . the song are good , the band is good , but it is not great .
1	what a find ! this is a wonderful album . it take me back to my childhood and time when i listened to music on the radio ( on the radio ! what wa i thinking ! ) . the melody are wonderful and the harmony and harmony are just perfect . i would have given this 5 star except there is a few track that are a little repetitive . i do like the album a lot though !
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i really enjoy this album , it is great .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	her voice is so powerful and so sincere . it is very inspirational . she is a very versatile singer and i am so glad to have her talent . i would recommend this cd to many .
1	this is very good . the music is great , and the lyric are great . i give it 4 star because it is a good album . i would recommend it to anyone who like old school punk rock . i am not a fan of pop rock , so i would not listen to this a a first date .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i love this cd , i think i have listened to every track of it at least twice . but every time i listen to this cd i think how much i love it .
1	i love the song fade . very emotional and powerful .
1	i love all of the song on this cd . the song are great . i like most of them , except for i will be missing you and candy shop . i wish there wa more song . i would have rated it an 8 .
1	i bought two version of this cd , one i listened to in my car , the other in my office . i really like both version .
0	this song my favorite song ! it ha a great beat , it ha a great rhythm , and it ha a great melody . it is a good song .
0	this is one of the dave clark five best album . it ha good song and really nice performance . it ha some really great song such a got ta serve somebody and you are gon na miss me . it is a very good collection of song .
0	i really like the song . it is not bad . it is a good choice for a wedding ceremony .
1	i love allan bole . i have grown to like his music , which is really no surprise . but i have grown to like him personally , which is a different story . i am kind of a big fan of the early 90 , but i found it is hard to find stuff that is not rock for me . i have listened to a lot of christian music , but i have never heard any christian music that i loved . i thought that i wa the only one . now i know that i am not .
0	this cd wa one of the best i have ever purchased . it wa one of the first cd i ever purchased and i have since purchased about 20 more . it is one of the best cd we have ever purchased .
1	this song , sung by me , is my favorite christmas song .
1	this a great song . i really like the background vocal and how it sound with the guitar and drum going
1	i am a big fan of r. kelly music and have been for year . this cd ( the best of r. kelly ) is by far one of the best of his cd . he ha one of the best voice ever . and , he used it very well on this cd . this cd is great . the first cd i ever bought wa from the root of the earth , and i have been a r. kelly fan ever since . i have been through many cd and i have not seen one that i have not enjoyed . i just love this cd . i am very happy that i have found this cd .
1	i wa a bit confused when i first started listening to this cd , i thought that wa the only song on it . i decided to give it another chance and listen to the whole cd . i wa blown away by the lyric and the music . this song really touched me . i am glad i had the courage to give this cd another try .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i like her song . i have a few of them . i like her song .
1	this album is a great compilation of many different style of trance , which is what i liked about this album . the vocal were amazing , and the song were very diverse . i really like it , and i really hope that they release it again someday .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this song is one of the highlight of the album , but i do not really like it . it is catchy , but it doe not grab you like the other song .
1	in the 60 they were the best , and they are still the best and the best . i hope that this is the last cd they do . i have over 30,000 cd , and i have a lot of dead music . i hope that this is the last cd they do , because i would rather listen to them then anything else .
0	this is one of the coolest band i have ever heard . i love the way the song blend together and do not sound like a whole lot of different song . it is a great mix of rock and blue .
1	tom wait is a great singer and a great song writer .
0	i have been very disappointed with a lot of the new release of this great song . i wa a bit excited about this new version , but this version is pretty poor . i can not find any of the song lyric . it is pretty bad .
1	the original is better . this song suck . i love this song .
1	i love you . thank you . you make me happy . you make me so happy . thank you .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i had the song oh boy sung to me by my high school choir teacher . i loved it so much that i asked him to write a song for me . he came up with this song and asked me if i would sing it to him . i said yes , and he recorded it for me .
0	got ta love a song by a guy who actually got to play guitar on it . i know i am not the only one , so i will just put it out there that this wa the only thing i wa looking for in this year disc list .
0	i have played this one a handful of time in my setlist . it is not my favorite , but when the band is on , this is a great song to rock out to .
1	when i first heard this song , i wa enthralled . i wa in awe by the melody , the way it seemed to have a beautiful melody and yet not overwhelm the listener . it just sounded so beautiful . i have listened to it numerous time and each time i am left satisfied . i have not met a single person who doe not like it .
1	i bought this cd for my sister , she really enjoyed it .
0	so far this is the worst christmas gift i have ever received . i am disappointed that this wa not a good seller .
1	he is in the right place and time to make a good record . the song ha a good beat and the lyric about the snow and new year eve are interesting . i do not think it is a good song , but a good one .
1	this is a great cd of folk music . it is the second cd in the folk anthology series , which contains all the album in the series . the first one wa just an album . i would say that this one is a little better . it ha more of a musical feel to it . i would say the other cd is good , but this one is better . i like the folk music here a lot . i just wish there wa more music . i am a little disappointed by the fact that we do not have more music . i am a little disappointed that we do not have any more music . i wish that there wa more music . i love it when something is released . i know that i do .
0	this cd is nothing but a bunch of annoying singer , i do not have time to listen to other cd . i am glad that you review this cd . i would not be able to listen to it anyway .
1	this song is awesome .
0	a little le rock and roll with a little more pop and rock . and at the end , stairway to heaven , just about the only song that make me want to dance . but the rest of the album is quite good a usual .
0	good song , except the vocal just seem to lack the energy and confidence . maybe this is due to the fact that they were recorded at such a low quality . but the song is still fun . i like the chorus and the guitar work .
0	it is good , but i like the first part . the second part is kind of annoying . but i like listening to it .
1	i bought this cd with the intention of just listening to it . my first impression wa it sounded great . however , when i listened to i can not quit you i immediately became interested in the band . i had no idea who they were , but their music wa really good . the vocal were not at all annoying , and i wa really impressed with the musicianship . i will definitely purchase this cd again .
0	this cd wa very good . i will definitely buy it again .
0	not exactly what i expected not sure where he got it from the song is ok but the style doe not fit the beat are very different i like the song but i would have preferred a song with a simpler beat i did not like this track and i doubt anyone else doe either .
1	i am a big fan of r & b/soul/jazz . i do not think that i ever really like this kind of music . i do not even think that i have ever listened to this type of music before . this is a good cd though . i like the fact that it is a good album and it ha a high quality sound . i also like the fact that every song is different . it is very good .
0	i have a weakness for him , and he is a great singer , but this is his worst album .
0	this song is a little bit catchy but the lyric are just terrible . they are so bad and it just make it so pointless .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	i am loving this song . it sound like a song you would sing at a wedding . the song is very clever and catchy . i loved it on the radio .
1	i love this album . the only exception i can think of where this one is lacking is the one track where she sings i wan na tell you to someone and the other one where she sings i do not wan na be alone to a lover that is currently being murdered .

0	i had to listen to this song over and over . i am thinking about turning off my phone and listening to the mp3 to hear the song in it original form . this song is not worth the $ 10.00 that i paid for it .

0	i can not believe this is my first review of any cd , because if this is what i get for reviewing cd , i should not be spending my time doing this . i am not even sure why i bought this cd . i did not listen to it until it wa too late . it wa a cd that i purchased at the local library . i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa working on my computer , and i saw this cd and thought it would be a good one to listen to while i wa typing . i bought it not knowing what it wa about . i listened to it a few time , and then i decided to just throw it away . the most annoying part about the song is that it is the only one where she sings the word while doing a crazy dance .

0	this is the best cd i have ever bought .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	the site is great ! i really like it . i like the fact that i can go to the site and find a great song that i like . i like the fact that i can find music by the name of the band . i like the fact that i can find any song i like and i can listen to it on my ipod . it is great . it is great .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	i downloaded a bunch of these song for my friend and family to sing . they all love this song . it is a really good song .
1	music is a source of comfort and hope .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i really like her voice and music and hope to be able to hear her again .
1	i just wanted to give a quick review of this cd . i am not a singer , and i like to write . i love the song , and i love the artist . i received the cd in a very nice box , with a nice note from the artist . i am very happy with the cd .
1	i wa looking for a new version of this classic , but found none . this version is very good . the lyric are great , and the instrumentation is excellent .
0	this is way too many line repeated .
0	i bought it to make a cd for my car .
0	i think this is a terrible song . it doe sound like it would be a hit if it wa sung by anyone other than tom wait . the instrumentation is so bizarre that it make it difficult to figure out what song it could be . it sound like the member of this project are either performing for themselves , or for the other member of their band . the song doe sound like it would be fun to listen to , but it just make you think that maybe this band wa a mistake .
0	i love her album but i just do not like the new stuff .
1	beautiful song . i like the beautiful music .
0	this song is good . it is not like anything i have listened to before .
1	what a good album . what a good album . i am happy because it seems to be what i wa looking for when i purchased this cd . i think it is a good album . i am happy because it seems to be what wa looking for when i purchased this cd . i think it is what wa looking for when i purchased this cd .
1	i have been listening to this album for year , but i know that i did not know him until i heard this album . this is my favorite . i love this album . the song all alone with something to say is just so beautiful . the song is so beautiful . it make me want to go to a concert , to go to a party , to do anything . this song just take me away . when i listen to it , i feel like i am in a room with a group of people singing together in harmony . it make me feel like i am in a room with a great group of people singing for me . it make me feel like i am at a group of people singing for the one i love .
0	this is not a good recording of the concert . it is the best version i have heard so far . the sound is good , but the quality need to be better . the sound quality could be better . i could swear the bass wa better in the other version than this version . the audience wa nice , but not great . i think they were too loud and i think they were a little too loud . the sound quality is not very good and it is hard to hear the audience . the sound quality could be better . the sound quality could be better . it could be better . i would pay good money for it . i would buy it again .
0	this is a commercial cd , because it is the latest in a line of cd to be released by a label called fwd . i own a handful of the fwd album , and this is the first cd that i have purchased that wa not worth buying . i really do not understand why i would pay this much for something that is inaudible . the music on this cd is boring and ha almost no groove . the only way this cd could have sold is if fwd put a lot of money into the design of the cd . i am sorry , but this cd is a waste of money . if you have the money to spend on this cd , go to a better label .
0	i am not sure why they have this here , but it is not listed in the review .
0	this is a really good album . this is one i would recommend . it is not an easy listen , but i like it . the first time i listened to it wa in a hospital where i wa having a procedure done on my knee . i had been waiting for hour and wa exhausted . when i got home , i listened to it . the first time i listened to it , i wa about to go to sleep . i lay in bed for several hour , and when i got up i listened to it again . when i put it on , i wa so relaxed , and i wa able to go to sleep . when i woke up the next morning , i wanted to listen to it again . the next time i listened to it , i took it off my stereo and put it in my pocket and left it there the rest of the day . i listened to it the next morning while i wa on my way to work and it wa a great escape . it made me smile . i am a very happy person and i love listening to music . i thought that this album would be just like one of my favorite album , live at the royal albert hall . i enjoyed it , but it would not be my favorite . i would highly recommend this cd . it would be my first choice if i had any problem with my knee . i would recommend this to anyone if they were in a situation like i wa in .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this show is wonderful ! a wonderful musical ! it is an excellent show . it is about a jewish man who try to understand his grandfather by looking at his past , and his grandfather past . it is a very deep musical , and i enjoy the actor very much . i do not know how many show they do a night , but i will be seeing it again .
0	i do not like this song , the song is too long for me . i like when a song is short and simple . this song is so long that you have to put it on repeat to hear the song . i am sorry , but i do not like this song .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i would just like to say that i love this song , and i love the cover and the original , both of which have their own unique quality , but i do not love the way this cover cover the original .
1	love this album !
1	i really like the song .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	this is a great christian song .
0	i have purchased this cd twice and both time i have listened to it with my 4 year old daughter . i always tell her to play it when she play her music , and she doe . the cd is great and would recommend it to anyone that like music .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i love the chorus to this song . i can not get enough of it .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	rnbrett is a great singer but he is too good a singer and just can not sing rnbradleys song , and he is a disgrace to the industry . his song are just terrible .
1	i have to admit that i only listened to this cd for a few minute , but i have to say that i really liked love you so . i did not find the lyric offensive though .
1	i think hasselvander is a very talented singer and musician . i think it is not enough to say he is a good singer because he could sing for so long . he ha a way with word and the melody of the word . my favorite song on this album are somewhere in the shadow , all of the above , and circling . i love all the song in this album . it is a really good album . i will be purchasing the album .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	the quality of the recording is very good . the sound is very clear and not too much background noise . the recording quality is top notch . the sound is clear and the recording is very good . it is a good listen all the way through , and the solo section are very good .
0	this is a very good album and very good collection . the only complaint is i wish the song were longer .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i really liked this song . i really liked how it wa written . it is not a bad song . i really liked it . it is not a bad song .
0	i have bought several of these cd . they have helped me feel better . i have ordered several more to listen to .
1	she is got a great voice .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i love this song and the video is amazing !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	one of my favorite song of all time . i find myself singing this song when the world get dark and lonely . it is a great song , and it is a great way to get the world back to normal .
1	this cover is alright . it is a cover band . i will check out the rest of the song .
1	i really like dave clark five .
1	this is my second favorite hammond album . this album is very good , but there are better song than this one , which is the song i am referring to .
0	i love this album very much
0	interesting lyric , but not a good song . the chorus is catchy , but a for the verse , i feel it is a little to complicated for my ear . the song is good for background music , but not something worth keeping around for a long time .
0	i love this recording . i know many people will hate it , but i think it is the best of the lot .
1	this is a nice album . i think it ha a good quality and i like most of the song .
1	this cd is very well done . i can listen to it all day long . i love billy joel .
0	i have seen this album on many tv program and i have never been disappointed . the album ha some great song and prince is one of the best artist in the world .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i bought this for my son . he love it .
0	there is no original song . it is a cover of one of her song . i do not like the song or the cover .
1	this wa the third album after amber song and vermillion that i bought a a kid . this song is still one of my favorite and i can not get enough of the album !
1	the best trance album of the year so so far , and the first trance album i have ever bought . i would recommend this album to anyone who like trance .
1	this is the most inspirational album i have ever heard . i am a christian and i am very thankful that i have found this album .
1	this one is not bad , but it never made any impression on me . i have never been a big fan , but i thought it wa decent . i remember listening to it with a friend and he loved it , but i did not . i still can not get into it , but i like it enough to buy it . i am not sure if i have heard it before , but i think it is on the the best of cd , but i can not tell for sure . i will probably put this on the to buy list , but i am not sure it is worth buying every time i hear it .
0	great , but not a good a i remembered . it is not that it is bad , it is just that i had a hard time recognizing the music - the vocal were a little out of place . i like the guitar work , but i am not sure how much of it i can actually remember . it is a good guitar album , but i am not sure i can say the same for the vocal .
1	i just recently found this cd in my dad music collection . i loved the fact that it wa a true grateful dead album , complete with a full orchestra , and a drumline . what a treat , and i would highly recommend this cd to any fan of the grateful dead .
0	i think the most fun live album i have ever heard .
1	i am a regular listener of this cd . i have been listening to it for a couple of year . i like it .
1	an album that i love . i have been listening to her since i wa in high school , and i never had a cd player . i can always count on her music to always fill my heart .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this is a great album . i have been a fan of the band for year and i would love to see another album by mr. hammond .
1	i love perry comos music . i have been collecting his album since he wa in his teen . this is my all time favorite christmas album . i love this album and wish him well . perry como is a true artist . he sings and writes his own music . he writes for himself and not for other people .
1	this cd is great because it includes a mixture of song that i grew up to like and song that i have not heard in a while . i am not sure if it is for me or not , but it is definitely worth a listen !
0	i do not like this cd at all . the song i enjoy are not played and all of the song i like are repeated .
0	i wa lucky enough to get a cd in a good case a well . got this cd over a month ago and i have not been able to play it since . i have tried for two night and have gotten nothing but a dead battery . i guess the cd is not a good a i thought . i will try again when i get another one .
1	i think this is a great song ! the lyric are a wonderful way to communicate your love for god and to show your love and devotion to him . the music is beautiful .
1	this live cd is good and the band sound great . it is very long but not too long .
1	this is great . it is one of the best album i have heard .
0	i would have bought it for myself but i did not like it . no offense .
1	i bought this album in advance ( since it wa the last issue ) so i had a chance to listen to it on my drive home from work . i heard a lot of great thing about the band when i listened to it online . i then bought it from the local thrift store . they do not have any cd by this band so i bought it from them and it came with a nice cover and a nice booklet . it is one of those cd that you buy and give it to your friend to listen to .
1	i love this song ! my family sang it until they were hoarse , including the dog .
1	this is a great album . the music is great , but the lyric are
0	i like it ! it is a fun song !
0	i have listened to this album for year .
0	this song is very good .
0	the most amazing recording i have ever heard . the sound quality is excellent and this is some of the most exciting music in my collection . m.j .
0	i am very disappointed in this song . i can not believe it wasnt even on the album . the song is really boring . there is no melody or anything to it . it is just a little bit of a disappointment .
0	i have never heard this song before , so i am trying to find out if it is good or bad . i think it is good , but maybe not for everyone .
1	just bought this album and am enjoying it a lot more than i thought i would . i wish i could hear more of the song i like the most . i will probably buy the next album .
1	this song ha a very good beat and is very catchy . i like this song .
1	steve morse wa a great musician and a great man . this album is outstanding . steve wa one of the best . this is the definitive version of his music . the record is excellent in every way , from sound to detail and feel . if you like late 70s/80s steve morse , this is the album for you .
1	this song is awesome . it is fun and catchy . i would buy the album . thank you .
1	i have been listening to her music for about a week and i have to say , i do not think i will ever be able to listen to it without getting emotional . i love her music and i think i will buy this cd .
1	i have tried to listen to this cd over and over again , and every time i do , it grows on me . t.l .
0	i think that this is one of the best song ever performed by the beatles . if you listen carefully , you will hear that the opening part of the song is rocking . and the whole song is about the same . i do not know what rocking mean , but it sound cool . i wish that they had recorded it on a cassette tape so i could have listened to it again .
0	i am going to take a moment to let this guy know he should get a life . he is a very talented artist and doe not deserve to have a record company waste their time on something so badly written and sung .
1	i wa expecting something different but this is a great song
0	very interesting . great vocal . i do not think i have heard anyone sing like that in a long time . the instrumentation on this cd wa a little strange , but it wa good . i find it hard to listen to when there is not much bass . this wa the only one that had low bass . and it wasnt bad . there wasnt much percussion , but the drum were a little too loud . it would have been a great record if they had only recorded the bass . but there were others that were really good .
0	great song , but the vocal are not the right one ! not sure if he is drunk or sick , but it sound like his voice is coming out of a small paper bag .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what is advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like he or you do not .
1	this app is so easy to use and ha a great selection of christmas song . i love the lyric by the way- they are very well written . i have been using this app to teach my daughter the word to christmas song and she love them ! this app is a great addition to any music lover home !
1	it ha been a long time since i have had a good trance album . i am glad i finally found this album and i will be keeping it in my collection .
0	i liked the music on this cd . it wa great to listen to because i got to hear all of the song . i really liked the music on this cd .
1	this album is a little bit of a change . i am thinking of buying it , but then i think of the other reviewer who have said that this wa a terrible album , so i think i will wait . i am glad i have this cd . it is a very good cd .
0	i like his sound .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i have listened to him a few time and i think he is really good . he ha some great song .
1	this is great ! it is not a piece of art , just solid music . do not listen to it for the music . you will end up hating it . just enjoy the song .
1	i have not heard the new album , but i am sure it will be a good a the last one .
1	i really like this cd , i have been listening to it for a long time . i really like the production . i know it is not the best , but i like it . i think david lee roth is one of the best singer ever . and i think he is one of the most powerful voice . it is his voice , so he should be able to sing like that . the lyric is one of the best , and they are always thought provoking .
0	i liked the album .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i really love this song . it is a pleasant surprise from a very good songwriter .
0	i bought several of these cd to give to my friend . i love the way they make me feel when i am having a bad day .
1	i love this stuff . it is not too heavy , not too fast and with a very interesting and catchy beat . i really like this album .
1	this is my favorite worship song . i like it because the song go in an in a good direction .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this album is not one of the most interesting album . i find this album boring and not very good . i think it is not worth the money .
1	i can tell you are an old fan of musical because i like this song . the lyric are very touching . the sound quality is excellent .
0	i really like this song .
0	this song wa the first song i heard on the radio . i loved it .
1	i have been working on this app and thought it wa a good buy .
1	this wa one of the best trance album i have ever heard . this is a great album .
1	this album is absolutely wonderful . i can not listen to it for a long time without getting goose bump . the song were very well crafted , the vocal were clear and well-spoken , and the production wa top-notch , but it just did not quite do it for me . the album ha a great balance of song that are both upbeat and very relaxing at the same time , with the occasional down-tempo song thrown in . the only song i did not care for wa doubt , but i did not listen to it long enough to hate it . overall , this is a very highly recommended album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this cd wa a good way to spend a saturday . i like the fact that it is a little different from the average cd because it is not like any other cd . the song are very different than the other one i have listened to . it is different . it is a very different cd .
0	i am not a huge fan of this cd . it doe have some good song , but they do sound a bit repetitious with repetitious phrase .
0	i love this album .
1	i have been so curious about this album because i have been wanting to get the singer album for a long time , but i wa waiting for my birthday ( which came 3 day before ) to get it , but i have finally ordered it and i am sooooo happy and excited .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	keith s. is a great guitarist , a great singer , and a good songwriter . i like keith side , but he doe not write song . this album is a re-recording of the same album . it is a good disc , but i would not buy it .
1	i think this is a very good album . i really like it . it is not that interesting .
0	this is no masterpiece , but it is a great album - just listen to the guitar solo and you will have no doubt . there is a new age feeling to this album , which is refreshing and welcome . the song have a nice swing to them and you can just imagine the guitar solo . i would recommend this to anyone who like great rock and blue and can not get enough of it . if you like acoustic album you should try this .
1	i like this cd very much . although it is not my favorite dave clark five recording , it is in my top 3 of all time song . i would gladly listen to this cd over many , many others . i think it will always be a high recommendation . i would like to say that this is a good cd , however i will not state that it is better than any other . there is nothing bad about this cd , it is just my personal opinion . i believe that any fan of the dave clark five should own this cd , it is a great way to introduce new fan to their music .
1	i am an old soul and it is about time a good christian music album came out . the christmas album from the original artist , not the christian artist . it just wasnt the christmas album i wa looking for . it is good , but it wa not the christmas album i wa looking for . i still like it though . i did enjoy listening to it .
1	i really enjoyed the cd and would recommend it to others . i really enjoyed listening to the cd and would be interested in purchasing more music .
0	this song is by a young man who is only a few year older than i am . i never thought i would fall in love with him . i wa so wrong . i do not know why it happened and it is the most amazing thing in the world . i love it and i do not know why it happened . i love a man that i will never have .
1	this is just a song , but it doe have a good beat- nice guitar work .
1	i have listened to this album several time and have really enjoyed it . the album is really good , the song are really good , and i like to listen to jps music . i enjoyed listening to his music and i thought he wa really good . i think this album is a definite buy .
0	i do like this song , it is very well played and the singer sound good , even though the song is all over the place .
1	a a fan of lorde , i wa excited to see this one on tape . it wa well done .
1	i am going to have to give this a positive rating . i love this song and the music video . the lyric are just a catchy a the song .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	this is the best tom wait cd i have ever heard . this is soooo great it is no wonder he is so popular . i love this cd . i love his music . i like his lyric .
0	i like the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i is very mad about that .
0	i am in love with this recording . it is my favorite beethoven recording .
1	i like the dave clark five .
0	i wa looking for an album that contained some of jewel new song , and i did not find one . this is a well-made and well-produced album that wa clearly put together to promote her new record . if she put out a new album in the future , i will buy it , but for now , i will wait .
1	it wa a great song and ha great message .
1	i bought this album to listen to while working on my car . it wa the first album i bought from amazon.com . the review is good , the album is very good . this is a great album for the car audio enthusiast . i would recommend it to anyone who want to enjoy good music while driving their car . i would rate it 4.5 out of 5 star . i also bought a cd of george harrison solo rendition of my sweet lord and that one wa also very good .
0	the biggest disappointment of this album is the song are not a good a the song on the two previous album . this album ha a lot of good song with good melody , but the song are not a good a the one on the previous two album .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i wa really disappointed that the lyric were different from the original . the sound quality is great . the arrangement is good . the lyric are interesting too ! i am glad i downloaded this version . i really enjoyed listening to this . i am not a huge fan of john kander but this version of the song is really good !
0	i went to this website to look for some recommendation and review on some of the cd i am about to purchase . i found all the cd to be of good quality . this is the 6th cd i have purchased from this website . overall , i think i am more than pleased with the cd i have purchased from this website .
1	i just received my cd in a cracked case and the case wa cracked . the cd wa in a cracked case , but in a nice , clear plastic . this is one of the best cd that i have received . the cd is very clear and ha a nice sound . this cd is worth the money .
0	this cd wa pretty bad , only good thing wa that i could understand some of the lyric .
0	tom scott - the unheard . a great album .
0	i love this album ! it is a good album but for the price it should have been better .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this is probably the best radio program i have ever listened to .
0	i bought this cd at the recommendation of a friend . the price wa good , but the music wa good . i will definitely buy the cd again !
1	this song is very beautiful .
0	i got to hear this album on cd and it is awesome .
0	i bought this cd because i thought it might be a good recording of the beethoven 9th . i wa not disappointed . the recording is crisp and clear and the composer performance is vivid and powerful .
0	this album is good and make you want to hear more of her music .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i like this song !
1	i have nothing negative to say about this song . i love the video , it is very funny and the artist voice is great .

1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i recently purchased this in order to hear jp play . i am disappointed . the guitar playing is fine , but the song writing is not appealing to me . the song spark is really uninspiring . the music is good , but the lyric are not all that interesting . this doe not sound like the type of music jp usually play - i am disappointed . i will no longer support jp .
0	i have listened to this album a few time now , and i like it . the song on this album are enjoyable , and i like the different style of music that they put on the cd . the musical style of this album varies from the first song to the last . it is very good , with a nice selection of song . i thought the selection for the lover concerto and carnival of light were good . it is a good album that i can get a lot of enjoyment from .
0	i have listened to it three time . the only dud is the last song so alone . it is a very good album . i would recommend this album to anyone that like good music
0	this is my all time favorite album from this artist . this is a great album . i have always liked this artist . i remember the first time i heard him sing live . i wa floored by his singing . it wa so good and unique . i love how he ha such a great message for people . i love his message . i am getting this cd on cd . i hope it is worth it . i do not think you will either . i wa really disappointed in the quality control . i am just happy you guy are releasing it at all . i hope you get more fan from this .
0	this is the only cd i own . i have it in a plastic casing . i love the cover . the music is great . i think it should be rated at least half star . the song are great , but i do not think the track are all that good . i would give it a 0 , but i do not know if i can .

0	i love the song on this album . it is a classic .
0	i am a fan of her music but when i saw the album cover i thought it might be something different from her normal . it wa a mixture of soft rock and some folk type song . i like the cover art but i do not like the music .
1	great song ! love the music and the lyric !
0	a really great song .
0	a good album - the only problem is that it doe not really stand up to the rest of her material that i have heard . it is not a bad album in any way , but it is not the best .
1	this is a great jazz album . it is very hard to find a jazz album this great . it is like a mixture of the great jazz of the 60 and the great jazz of the 80 . this is a great album that you will not regret .
1	great album . love the way he is able to put his signature on the music and the way a melody is carried across a solo . his originality and creativity .
1	i like it when the lyric are sung in a different voice for the purpose of getting the song to sound more like a rap song . however , i do not like the song when i hear it in my head . i find it annoying .
1	the album is overall a great one but there are a few song that just made me really uncomfortable . the song could be great , but the vocal were just a little too low , which really took away from the song .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	this make me happy .
1	the band live album are always good . i purchased this one because of the cover and wa pleasantly surprised .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

1	this is a very good album . i am not sure why so many people have criticized this album . it is decent , but not great . if you like heavy metal , you will like this album . if you do not , then please do not listen to this album .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i love rnb but when i came in contact with the gnr the other day i wa really surprised from their music . i really hate for them to make this kind of a move .
0	i love this song and i really like this band . it is so good . i bought this song for my girlfriend and i listen to it together .
0	this is a very underrated trance album . the only reason i bought this instead of state of trance wa because it had more track than state of trance , which wa my favorite trance album and i wa not going to buy it . i love the mix of old school and new school trance . the only reason i am not recommending this album is because it is not a great trance album , but it is a great album overall .
0	so this is a good song . it is good . i like it .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )

1	i just got dave clark five , and it is the best cd i have ever heard . dave clark 5 are the best !
0	
0	really cool .
0	this is an excellent compilation of ansermet recording . the recording themselves are excellent and the compilation itself is excellent . the playing is fantastic for the most part , but the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruin the experience for me . i would have liked to have had a sound engineer that wa better than what i had .
0	i liked the song , but i did not like it . i like the way she sings it .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i wa really disappointed with the first 30 second of this album . i could not handle the crammed sound of the recording . i could understand the instrumentation , but the sound wa just too forced , and when it wa over , it wa time to put the cd away and go and enjoy the last few minute of the evening . i felt i wasted my time and money . i found the album at a great price , i can not believe it wa the first album i ever saw and i wa not disappointed .
1	this band is a good one . i like this song .
0	this cd is actually available on amazon cd store . i had to check this out because i wa interested in the track i am not there by the new pornographer . i downloaded it and found it to be a great tune ! i am still on the fence about getting it . a little more information : this is a live album recorded by a band in holland . they were playing at a public concert and it wa broadcast on a radio . that is all i can tell you about it .

0	it is an eagle album with a pretty good track list . the song are pretty good . the only problem is that it is the same a the original album . i do not like the way this album is put together . it just doe not have anything new to offer . it is just an eagle album with the same song in the same order that they were on the original album . i will give it 4 out of 10 star .
1	an old favorite that never get old . i really like this song .
1	good song !
1	i have bought this album many time and i always enjoy it .
1	these guy ( kurt vile and the violator ) had a hit song called american girl and i wa fascinated by the idea of a woman who had to go to college . i always thought the song wa a little too sappy for me , but i thought i would give them a try . i purchased their debut album in a small store in the mall in the town where i lived . the store owner told me to call him if i had any problem with the cd . i thought they were great , so i called the store . he told me that he had already received the cd and there were no problem . i made sure to listen to them and decided that they were pretty great . i think this is one of the top five album i have ever purchased . it ha a lot of good song and is very enjoyable .
1	this song is a great cover of the original . it is not a parody , it is not an imitation , it is not a cover , and the song is amazing . the only thing it is not is the original version , but that is only because of the fact that this is an english song . unfortunately , song in other language are usually the original version , which are never a good a their english counterpart .
0	i love the beatles in my heart and soul . i love their music and i love the beatles . but this is not the beatles best album . i know , i know , i have heard it all . and i love it all . but this is not the beatles best album ! it is not bad , it is not great , it is just not the best beatles album .
1	i wa a great fan of barbra streisand and this album just came out now and i wa so excited . i wa so excited that i bought it immediately when it wa out . i wa so excited because it wa one of the first album that i purchased that did not include a big expensive cover . i also just love barbra streisand . i do not know why she is so popular , but she wa and still is .
1	this is an amazing song . the album is not all that great . however , this song is an amazing song .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i downloaded the song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple .
1	this song is sung with more emotion . the song is a little slower . the song is beautiful .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i have listened to this album twice , i love the song love is not enough . i also love the song so it go i do not think you can go wrong with this album if you like hammond type of music .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i wa waiting for this the whole time and wa very disappointed .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	barbras album is a compilation of her early work . it is a really good album , but i do not think it is barbras best work . i love her voice and would love to be able to hear her in concert , but i do not think this will happen anytime soon .
1	i love the song and it message , it helped me through my grief and helped me get through some tough time .
1	i have listened to many of her song . she is a wonderful performer . the voice is amazing . i liked some of the cd she did in the old day . i liked the cd she did with jerry .
0	this is crosby , still & nash second album . it is a live album from their 1979 tour . it feature four song from the album , and two other song from the previous album , but the song from the current album are not included . the recording are from the tour , and are not live , but are on the new album .
1	this is an excellent album . allan bole is an excellent songwriter and a wonderful musician . i recommend getting this album .
1	i love tom wait . i own several cd by him . i have loved his music for year . i love his voice . i have listened to all his album . he is an amazing singer . he is my favorite singer .
0	i have been a fan of reo speedwagon since the 1980s . i love this album and will continue to buy it so that it can be played on my ipod .
1	this album really is a great collection of christian music . i am very pleased with this album . allan bole writes for a good cause and i am very pleased with this album and i think it will be a great addition to your collection . i recommend this site to anyone who is looking for christian music .
1	i really love this song and it is one of my favorite song .
0	one thing i have noticed about this album is that it is very well produced . the sound quality is excellent . it is not bad at all . i actually thought it wa a great album . you can definitely tell that the music is great . the production is great . i really like this album . i do not know why , but it just doe . it is a great album .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	prince is back . i am really happy , because i always wanted to hear him play some of his song . i guess that i am not the only one who think this is his best , so i am happy . maybe he will do a new album again ?
1	i love love this album , it is so great !
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i love the song in this compilation . they are all good . i really like this compilation . the song are all very well sung and the arrangement are very well done . this compilation is a real great compilation .
0	i have listened to the album and have several song i love on it . i can not get into the song because of the music . there are a few song i like but the rest are not worth the effort . i would not trade this album for anything . i wish that they would release a better cd with a better selection of song . the album is a little over 2 hour long .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this cd is great ! i am amazed at how much i like it . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i have owned this cd for 5 month and have listened to it numerous time . i am very dissatisfied with the quality of the recording for the most part and the overall recording of the song ha been weak . i have purchased a lot of album from amazon and have never had a negative review . until now . i have listened to a lot of music over the year and the quality and playability is not usually high but this album is a prime example . the song do not have the soul and emotion in them that they should have . i have listened to the entire album and the song are not very good . this is the worst album that i have ever owned and i am very disappointed .
1	this song wa always one of my favorite . i had to buy this for my husband . he is a huge fan of the song . he wanted to know the story behind the song . i am glad he enjoyed the song .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i have never been a fan of sam . i have been looking forward to his black and gold performance . that turned
0	this is the first of 3 tape with the grateful dead , the first time i have ever seen a tape with the grateful dead . i bought it because i like the sound quality . it is very good . i have not listened to it yet , but i am going to listen to it . i am not sure if it is the right place to put this , but i am gon na have to say it anyway , since i am gon na have to say it anyway , since i do not know anywhere else to put it .
1	in my opinion , jewel ha been playing around with her sound more and more since her last cd . this cd is her best yet . she doe a great job mixing it up .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	this song is a perfect example of good old-fashioned country and western , and i am a fan of the music genre . i would recommend it to anyone who like their country music with a little bit of rock .
0	i used to listen to mary album and thought she wa a great singer . this cd ha nothing to do with marie osmond , just a bunch of old song mixed with a bunch of new one . i do not understand how this cd sold so well .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i just downloaded this song for my niece . she wa thrilled and the only thing she kept saying wa i love you .
0	one of the most brilliant album i have ever heard .
1	i love this album ! i love the gospel song too ! i love the worship song ! my favorite song is one pure and holy passion and the chorus is i will praise , i will praise , lord , i will praise . this song is great !
0	this is one of my favorite song of all time . it is great because it is from the show and it is a great song .
1	this wa a nice clean version .
0	i am not sure why there are so many review on this album , but they are good . i would recommend it .
0	this is a great song . i like it , but i do not think it is all that great . i do not know why people do not like it . overall , it is a great song . if you like this song , try this song . i like it , and i hope you like it too .
1	a very good song . i like it . i love the message , lyric , and music . i do not think it will be a hit . i think it will probably be my favorite album of the year .
1	sam sparros i do not wan na play that song is a great song that is well-written , catchy , and ha a great beat .
1	this is a very nice cd that wa given to me by an old friend . i wa surprised when it wa played for the first time and i wa amazed when it wa played a second time . i must say that the sound quality on this cd is amazing . i have listened to it several time and it sound a good a it did the first time i listened to it . the only problem is that it can take quite a while to play . when i first started listening to it it took me about 2 hour to listen to all of the song on it . i have listened to it more time since then and i know that i have listened to it for about 2 hour and 20 minute and it still is playing . this is a great cd and should be highly in demand .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i would recommend this song to everyone .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i have just listened to your cd and i have to say that they are great . i love your cd and i will be purchasing more .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	absolutely love it !
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more . do not get me wrong ! i do love a lot of van halens material , of both the roth and haggar era . but this is just not that great .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	love this song !
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	lame
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	so so
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	very nice , very niice .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	great
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
1	great song
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	poor audio quality .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	great song
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	sweet song and great lyric !
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	love !
1	the best
1	love it
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	great song !
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	fantastic song .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	great old song
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	what can you say lyle is lyle
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this song ha taken over my life
0	received wrong cd !
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
1	great !
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	great album i love it
0	not a great a i had hoped
