0	the previous one wa a little better , but this one still doe not stand up to the original . this is an interesting tribute , but it doe not really do anything new .
1	this is a great song . a song that i wish i had known year ago . i have listened to this song a lot . i like this song because it is very uplifting and very positive .
1	this is wonderful . i have bought other cd from this group , but this is the first cd i have bought with my money .
0	i bought this album for my friend who were interested in the music . i can say that while the music is good , it is not anything special . i did not like this album , but i still think it is worth a listen .
0	the dreadful song is a hit or miss for me . i am a fan of jewel work , but i am not a fan of this song . it ha a bad beat to it and is not so great in the vocal department . i have not listened to this song for a very long time .
1	i believe that zipper is his best album . the lyric are very deep and emotional , and the music is full of beauty . i believe that this album deserves to be on the top of the chart .
1	i love it ! i really enjoy the cover art and the instrumentation .
0	i agree with the other reviewer , this album is really bland . it sound like the same song they did when they were the hottest band in the country . the lyric are really bland and boring .
1	i first discovered this singer by listening to the song love you madly . i am a fan of this artist , since my discovery of her work .
0	this is a good song but it is not a very good song . it is just a generic song . i do not understand why anyone would buy this . it is just a generic song .

0	really cool cd .
0	i have listened to this song a couple of time and really like it . i guess it is a good song . i just do not understand why people think this is a great song . i never heard of the artist , and it is not even really like anything else i have heard .
0	i am a big fan , so i do not mind .

0	bernie the buffoon is an even bigger joke than i thought . bahaaaaa !
0	the quality of this product is poor .
0	i really do not care for this album . the music suck , the lyric are horrible , and the vocal are bad . not worth the $ 15 i paid for it .
1	this is an awesome song . the melody and lyric are great . but , the chorus is very boring .
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
1	this is by far my all time favorite nirvana album . i have heard every nirvana album at least once , and this one stand out from the rest . this is a very good tribute to kurt cobain , the man who wa an influence on nirvana . this album ha some of the best song in nirvana catalog . this album is fun to listen to . i have never been one
0	this is one of my favorite christian song . i love the way he sings it . very smooth .

0	this is not floyds best , but it is one of their finest .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
0	i love this band ! i love the song and i love the vocal and i love the instrument . this band is the only band that can even come close to making a perfect pop song . this band is a little out there for me , but i have great respect for their craft .
1	this song is a good song ! a good song ! this song is a good song ! the song is a good song ! this song is a good song ! this song is a good song ! the song is a great song ! it ` s a good song !
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state .
1	this is not a country song , it is a great song , a great song that will bring a tear to your eye and make you smile .
1	this is absolutely beautiful - especially by harp music .
0	i thought this song wa going to be very upbeat . however , this song is in a dark place . i do not think this song wa written for a happy ending . it is about how she is trying to get over the other guy but she can not . i think it is about how she is trying to get over the other guy , but she can not . i think this song is very good .
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song . dated late eighty early ninety production ha not dated too well . this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio .
0	i totally disagree . some people donât like this album because itâs more of a space opera than a science fiction album . i personally love it .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	i really like the guitar playing and the guitar riff . i have only listened to it twice , but i like it .
1	i love this song . it is very moving and is also very inspirational . thank you very much for a wonderful and very inspiring song .
0	wile i am sure it is just right for some folk , and i like a lot of cajun & zydeco music , this one just did not do it for me . i actually did not keep it . deleted .
0	radiohead are the best .
0	this guy is terrific . however , this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content . every song on one is on the other in the exact order . and i bought both thinking they would be different . really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title . great performer . probably a decent guy . but let u take one of those off the market ! it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky .
0	this song is a great song , but it would not have been my choice for a kiss song . i wa really disappointed in this version . i have a few friend who love kiss , and they have even asked me to buy the kiss cd . i have told them that i do not want to buy it right now , but that i will . but i do not , so i will have to find a new song to listen to .
0	this wa the best version of the album that i have heard . it is a great band .
0	i hate this song . how can a song like this sound so good ? there is absolutely no melody , and it just make me feel uncomfortable .
1	song from the black hole of space is one of my favorite album of all time , and i absolutely love everything about it .
1	i will be buying a lot of cd from you in the future .
0	my copy of this album had the sleeve with the picture of the sinatra that is on the cover , but the rest of the album wa a complete mess .
1	this is a great song that should have been on the album . i like the message . i like the song .
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness .
0	ive been a fan of the girl group since the early 90 and i wa a member of the old school of glee club in high school . ive heard them since and i love them . ive been to several of their show and even got to meet one of them while she wa in the house . i would buy all of their music but i think it would cost more than the price of a latte .
1	it is a very meaningful song !
1	this sound like a nice song but the sound quality is not up to par . at least the cd is a lot better than the dvd . i want to like this song but i am not sure . the song is a good song , and i think the movie is a good movie .
1	i love it ! i love it !
1	one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . lyrically , it is just the right size for a movie , or a drama . the music is perfectly suited to the lyric , and the harmony never fail to give a lovely atmosphere . i love the way that bonnie tyler voice can be so soft and sweet , but also have that little bit of edge that make you feel she could be just a fierce in a fight a she is on stage . the music and lyric work together very well to create a very unique and memorable song . i highly recommend that any and all who love this song give it a listen .
0	it is a good song , but i do not think i will be buying this one again .
0	a very old song , but it really doe have a different feel with the new version . it is very good and i do not mind the change .
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
0	this song is really good , but the song itself is not that good . the song is beautiful and ha a good message but the lyric are too long and the music is not bad . you might want to check out the other song on this album before buying this one .
1	soundgarden is one of the most underrated band in rock . they were always a band that inspired me with their music , their lyric , and their music video . this is one of the best album of the past 30 year , if not the best .
0	this album is a nice addition to the collection of new and classic rock . it is also a good addition to the disc of classic rock from the 1960s . it is well produced and ha a clear sound . the song are well written and have a lot of energy . a a rock and roll fan i like the song and feel that the band ha improved over the year .
0	warped upon arrival and water mark all over . doe not play correctly and unable to return . do not recommend .
1	i have been listening to jon anderson for 20 year

1	i did enjoy the beatles . i think they were the best band in the world . they are way better than bob dylan .
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
0	this is a total waste of time , i should have waited for the next album .
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape

0	after a great run , this is a letdown in my mind . it is not bad , but it is not going to blow your mind . i know the album wa originally released for $ 5 , but that wa before the market crashed . i am sure that in time , they will get back on top .
0	this is so cool . i wish more people would know about this song . it reminds me of my youth . i wish it would be played more often . it is so much better than the version that i have heard .
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener

1	this is a really good album , i do not like it , but i like the title track .
0	james is a douche .
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim , after i came across it while looking for another music title . i remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtrack , and thought that this would be similar ; but wa disappointed . i thought that this recording seemed fake , a if made by a synthesizer ( or in a bathroom ) . the track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop . like you , i base my purchase decision on the experience of others .
0	i bought this because it wa on top of my list of cd i wanted to listen to . that is all it wa . i would not recommend this cd to anyone . i would rather suck my own asshole dry and vomit the entire content of my stomach through a straw . i would not even bother listening to this song . i would rather eat my own shit . i would not even bother listening to this song . i would not even bother listening to this song . i am so over this cd .

0	i just love this song ! i have it on repeat for the next 20 minute . i like how she sings over the top of the song . great song .
1	i have a lot of respect for kiss . i think they are one of the most important and influential band of all time . i think they should be honored and honored to be still playing and to be still making music . this album is a lot of fun , but it is very annoying . you have to remember that this is one of their younger year , but they are still very popular with their fan . there are a lot of song on the album that , if you are a kiss fan , you will want to hear . the song are fast-paced , but kiss is so energetic and fun that many of their fan will want to dance

1	i never understood the negative review of this album . i love this band and i love all of their album , but this album is good .
0	this cd is very disappointing . it is not very good and the vocal are very boring .
0	this is not a bad cd , but it is not the best of the beach boy . i bought it , but i am listening to some different one now .
1	i bought this album because of the cover .
0	i dond know about this kind of thing .
0	im a big cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to cornell , soundgarden , audioslave , and totg fan everywhere . this should be a justin timbercrap song .

1	how can your toe not tap to this one . mar knock it out of the stratosphere again .
0	- it is a nice sounding vinyl copy of the album that wa put out by a local label . - i am not a fan of the two main artist involved ( either of them ) . - i wa hoping for a more positive review , but this is not bad . - i am not really into the music of this band , but i enjoyed hearing the song . - this album is definitely worth listening to . - i would recommend this to fan of the artist . - i would recommend this to fan of the artist
1	very nice song . i really like the chorus .
1	you are my soul is a very good tune to help you get to sleep . however , even with the help of this song , it is hard to fall asleep - and even harder to stay asleep . a the song fade out , you may start to drift in and out of consciousness while thinking , i will be damned - i have to go to work tomorrow . the song also contains the lyric i am not a child , i am an old man . this is a very nice idea , but you have to wonder if it wa ever used in actuality , or just in the lyric to make the song more interesting and interesting . a you may have guessed , i gave this cd only a 1 rating for this reason . this cd is a big hit with the wisdom of the west crowd , but i guess they are not the one to decide what is right and wrong .
1	if you like this , you will love this . great album !
1	*
1	this is a fine cd . i love it , and my son is singing along to it quite a bit . he love the song i will be you .
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .
1	this is one of my favorite song . is not great for the ear , but my ear are not great . it is a great song .

0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
0	there were only a few song i liked . not what i expected .
1	dancing music from flo rida . ha song lyric right round taken from an older song . so if you liek the older song , this one ha a modern twist , hip hop .
0	this is a great song , but i can not remember all the word
0	this cd wa a complete waste of time . i listened to it for a second and then put it back on my shelf . the album ended up getting on my nerve , and i could not help but put it back on my shelf .
1	this is a fun song . i like it . i am so glad it is on the cd . i love the word in the song .
1	best version of one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario , visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to .
1	this song is amazing ! you guy are the best band in the world ! : d
0	i bought this album and listened to it twice . i like it a lot . the song do not come closer wa a good example of the variety of song on the album . i like the variety in the song .
0	i can not say i liked this song at all . i found it to be very boring . i believe it wa one of the few song that wa on the radio during the time that the song wa released , and most people i know never heard it . even in the song , i believe it wa sung by a very young girl . it also wa one of the many song that came out at the time of the wrecking ball video . i know if i had to listen to music , i would have found this song to be boring , and possibly even annoying .
0	wow . i had a hard time finding this cd . it wa $ 15.99 at cduniverse.com . i could not find it at the local library . i did not even try the local book store . i even went to a music store and they could not find it . i finally found it at cduniverse.com . this is an outstanding recording of one of my favorite song . i think it is up there with roadhouse blue a a classic of country music . there are no bad or positive review of this cd , but there are a lot of very negative one . i really did not expect it to be so good . it actually sound like it wa recorded in a very poor recording studio . the quality of the recording is quite good . i recommend this cd to anyone who like country music .

0	i do not know why i bought this . i have listened to this album twice and only once it made any sense . lou reed and john zorn are my favorite musician . i love their album . i have listened to some of their other material and i enjoy it , but i just do not get it .
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd . i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen , ( very good song ) but this eternalize cd fell way short . musically these kid are very talented and great musician , however i thought the song writing wa bad , the lyric bad , and the vocal were bad - vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling .
0	this doe not sound like the type of song that i would expect to hear on a cd , given the name of the album . this is more like a country song . i will probably buy it , but i will probably return it .
1	i love the song on this album . they are not the same a other artist album , but i love them . they are very well written and i think they have a great future ahead of them . i do not think they will ever be the best in the industry , but i do think they will be in the top ten of the best . i love listening to this album , because i can hear the difference in the music . i love the fact that this album is different from other artist album . i think it is a great album , and i would recommend it to anyone who like good music !
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want . but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade . at least elvis wa able to produce some brilliance in this area , like blue christmas . this is tweedily dumb .
1	i love the idea of this song , but it is just really difficult to listen to . it is very over-produced , and the guitar solo and the message are awesome , but it just get a little too much .
1	another great song by matthew west ! this song can reach so many people , because everyone ha felt regret and despair .
1	i decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity .
1	i have to give it a few star because it is a great compilation cd that contains a good amount of rock music and the song are well put together . the cd is a classic rock compilation cd with a few song that were not all that memorable . i wa hoping for more song with great vocal . but , overall , it is a good cd .
1	christmas is the best party ever . you can not put a price on the joy of it .
1	i have been listening to this album non stop . i wa so excited to find this album to come home to , but i have not listened to it yet . i bought it a few day ago and i love it . i just do not know how to begin to describe it to you all . i have listened to it for the past 2 day and i have been in a deep state of listening to it . i have never experienced something like this in my life . it is a deep state of love that almost feel like , you are going to cry . it is been over a month since i have listened to this album . i bought it because i have always wanted to hear this album and i wa getting very tired of just listening to my own song . this album is just so beautiful and i just love it . this album ha no word but you can feel the emotion that it brings to the listener . there are no word and it is just so beautiful and it is truly a love song . i just found this album and i did not know what wa happening before i started listening to it . i wish that i would have known what i wa doing before i started listening to it . i have never experienced anything like this in my life and i can not describe it . i am really excited about this album and i do not know why . i just really love it . i love it so much . i really hope that anyone that hears this album that they have a good time and they will definitely remember the feeling that this album give to the listener .
1	this is one of my favorite song of all time .
1	this is not my favorite album , but this album is my favorite album volbeat ha ever made . i think this is the greatest album volbeat ha ever made .
1	very cute
0	i really like the song . there is something about the song that make me smile . i do not care for the lyric but i think they are funny .
1	this is a great recording of a great show , one that ha been around for quite some time . it ha some great song , such a i got you , i got you and i am gon na be a star , both of which have been covered by countless other artist , and some great one that have never even been recorded . i am happy to have found this recording of this wonderful show .
1	this cd doe what it say it doe . it is soothing and calming . the sound effect are also very good and realistic .
1	i love this song so much .
1	this album is very good . i really like it . i bought it cause it wa on sale . i like it a lot . i think it is great . i look forward to hearing more from this band . this album is very good ! i really like it !
1	i love adam song on this album . i like them a lot , and i am really surprised by the quality of this album . this is a great compilation of his song .
1	this song made me cry . i like that it is a sad song . the lyric are so touching . i would recommend this song to a friend who is going through a bad time in their life .
1	i bought it for my daughter for her birthday , i hope she like it .
1	this is the best hip hop album of the 20th century . this album is one of the best album of all time . this album is really great .
0	i bought this album because i needed a quick fix to get me through my holiday season . i am very happy with this purchase . i love the eclectic nature of joe augustine music and enjoyed listening to the god bless the child song .
1	good quality sound and it wa the original . enjoyed listening to this - took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio .
0	i like a lot of the song on the album . they are very , very good , but i could not listen to hummingbird one more time . it really just doe not sound like the song that wa on the movie . there are many song where the vocal are just not a good a the original .
1	i like this song because it reminds me of how much i love the lord and that i have to do what he tell me to do .
0	
1	this album is very good . the song on this album are very good , but the album itself is just okay . i like tom voice and the music is pretty good .
1	i have been a fan of joe for a long time but did not know what i wa missing out on . i stumbled upon this album via amazon and i have to say , this album is well worth the price . it is a great listen .
1	i would have given this song an a+ if it wa in the uk . but it is not in the uk . it sound weird and off in the uk . this is a little over the top in the uk too . i would give it a 4/5 , but i do not know if it is in the uk . but it is worth checking out .
0	i really enjoy this album . it is not a good a the essential randy bachman , but it is still a good album . some of it is very good .
0	this song ha a cool guitar riff but the lyric do not hold up well to the song . the best part of the song is the backing vocal , but when the band is singing the vocal get so high that it is easy to miss them .
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
1	this cd is hilarious , i admit there are some song that are not really funny , but there always 1 or 2 bad song on an album ( in this one , the 1 bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song ) . also if you are easily offended by swearing , raciest remark ( do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny ) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this . but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
1	this album is a great way to spend your money . it is a nice change of pace from the other beatles album and it is full of song that you can actually sing .
1	the song is about life and death . i know i did not need to be reminded of life and death , but i am glad someone had to . i am sure some people would disagree with me , but i thought it wa great .
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song , but it wasnt the same version a in the video . i deleted it .
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without knowing there wa a spoken-word ending that contained a racial slur . the spoken-word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall . this song is not meant to be a fun song , it is meant to be the heart of a song . i do not see the problem here - they are only using one example of a good message , and one example of a bad message .
0	jewel is at it is best . you can not get much better than what they did with this album .
1	love this album . this is the first album i have ever purchased that i wa not disappointed . i am a fan and really enjoy listening to the new song . the song are good and the production is good . i think the song are a little bit too short . there is only so much that we can hear in a song . but the album overall is very good . it ha the same great message that we heard on her first album .
0	my wife is a huge hank williams fan and i am a huge hank williams fan . i have been listening to this album for a couple of month . at first i disliked the album but after a couple of week i realize that the song are really good . i would suggest that if you love hank williams , jr. then you will love this album .
0	this album suck . like the other 1 star reviewer wrote , it is all commercial radio garbage . it is so overproduced , it is hard to listen to . i have been listening to the band since the late 90 and if you want to hear good o.a.r . you have to see them live or buy their first live cd . if you like this album , you are probably a new o.a.r . fan , or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 album back . which is not a criticism , but for people who remember them when they first started , their change to this is definitely a shock .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year , where her voice ha lost it luster , and she really ha not stopped for herself . musically , she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song . her latest song , diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course . i really did not find the song to deliver , a some of her earlier song had . i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice .
1	i always have . first heard it when it came out . this time i bought it s a gift for someone else .
0	not a bad bond title song . but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd . adele should be boycotted . barbara should be ashamed of herself causing cubby to roll over in his grave .
1	this song ha pretty good lyric .
1	i
0	i like the music , but can not figure out how to download it .
0	i believe this is a collection of song taken from a radio station . i found these while searching for song by elton john . some of the song are interesting , some of them are not . the production is good and the song are very well written ( and i think are elton john song , but have been written by a man named bob dylan ) . i give the album 3 star .
0	depression is what you will slip into when attempting to listen to this comedy album
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
0	this album is a complete waste of time . i should have waited for the next album .
1	i lost my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here . great love song .
0	i don ’ t know why the book is censored . i thought the book wa censored . this book is graphic and thus it should be reviewed a a whole . it ha a sex scene in there that is censored and not shown in the film the devil wear prada .
0	this is the most disappointing song on the dubstep album . i do not like it .
0	this review is based on my first impression of the album . i think that i will be very happy with it based on my second impression . i think that i will be very happy with it based on my third impression and i think that i will be very happy with it based on my fourth impression .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
0	
0	so many terrible rap song . i hate every rap song i hear . this song is a terrible song .
1	i love the sound of this album and the guitar playing is excellent . i think this is one of the best album of the past 30 year . it is a wonderful album , and although it is not my favorite , it is still a good album .
1	great music . love junkyard .
0	the song is actually good , but the lyric are just a little repetitive .
1	very good and very catchy . i would recommend purchasing this song for your cd collection .
0	the album is a good one , but i wish the intro had been removed . i like the song , but the intro is a drag . there are a few good song , but i wish the intro wa removed . i like the album , but i do not like the intro at all .
1	i love this song . i have always loved jim reef . i have been a fan of his since his early day with the duke of hazzard . this is a great song , and i really enjoyed it .
0	i bought this album on clearance about 3 year ago and have listened a couple of time but i have not bothered to go back and listen again . it is a really good album , but it is not a great album . this album is a really good collection of song but it is nothing special .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
1	this rendition of the song is a good version . it is a good version . it is a good version . i like the original version better .
0	i wa very dissapointed to find this album on my cd player . this is by far the worst album i have ever listened to . my mother died when i wa 11 , and my father wa working at a factory . i had to work from 5:00 in the morning till about 7:00 at night to help pay the bill . i could not believe that i would find this album on my cd player . i am a 13 year old girl who love to sing . i love the music and i love the lyric . i do not like this album . i will not be buying any more album by this guy . i will not be buying any more album by this guy .
1	one of my favorite album of the year . it is one of the better one he is done . he sings so much better , and he ha a much better idea of the song than he did on the last album . he is a much better songwriter . and he is a better vocalist . i would say he is one of the greatest vocalist of all time . i am glad he is finally putting out his best work . it is a great album worth owning .
0	i am not a fan of slipknot . i am a huge fan of song with a good story and catchy tune . slipknot is a great band . i have been a fan of slipknot since the first album i bought in 1999. the story that snakehips is telling is worth the listen . it is important to hear the story from the beginning to the end . i am not a fan of slipknot .
0	i think this is one of the best christina song of all time . her voice is amazing and her guitar work is fantastic . i wa really impressed by the fact that she kept the song the same length a the original recording , which is a rarity . i think it is great that she is able to play this song at all ! i will definitely be checking out her new album , my love is like a river .
0	there are some good song on this album , even some gem . it is a really nice collection of song . some of the song have a great quality to them . some of the song you could do worse than play , but not all of them . i do not like the song that many people have said that they like . i do not think they are bad , but i do not like them .
1	this is the best album of the year ! i love this album . i love the lyric . it is my favorite album of the year . i really like the guitar playing and how the song are mixed together . i think it is one of the best album of the year . this is a great album . i really like the lyric .
0	there is a lot to like about this album - the guitar is very good , the lyric are memorable , the playing is solid . but it just doe not work for me .
0	i am a manowar fan . this is the worst album i have ever heard . i am glad i bought this album . i do not know what the band is doing . i guess they are trying to get back into the old day .
1	i have a lot of friend who know this band and they all like this album . they like the song , the lyric , the cover and the music . i wa the original fan and started to listen to this album when it came out on cd . i listened to it once and then lost the cd , so i have only listened to it once now . it is very good . it is a very good mix of rock , funk and pop . my overall feeling about this album are good . i love the song , the lyric , the cover and the music .
0	i like this album . i think this is a good album . the song are easy on the ear . the production is good . the lyric are good . the guitar and bass sound are good . the song writing and structure is decent . but , in the end , i think you get a boring and uninteresting album . i think you should get a better album . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great sounding and easy to listen to album .
0	i have listened to all of jeremy camp song and i love them all . this song is the best of the bunch . i love jeremy camp . i love his voice . this song doe not fit any of the other song on the cd but it is very meaningful to u . this song is a great song to sing to your kid . i love jeremy camp . i love him !
0	this suck . this is a terrible song . i hate it .
1	this album is really good . it is a compilation of song that you play when driving or on the way to the place . i like this album a lot .
1	wishbone ash ha always been a favorite of mine and these recording are exceptional in quality
1	johnny hartmann , the man , the best !
0	i like bob dylan . this album wa just awful .
0	i purchased this album because i loved the music it contains , and i am sure the song are awesome , but i am not a fan of the cover .
0	this album wa good the first couple of time , but after awhile it just get annoying . the music wa good and i thought that they were trying to go for a new direction . but after awhile it just sound to hard for me to put any kind of emotion into it .
1	i love yolandas music . the music is very soothing , and ha a positive feeling to it . the arrangement are very beautiful , and the sound of the album is very good . it is a very good album , and i would highly recommend it to those who want to listen to good gospel music .
1	i am a huge fan of these guy . i first heard this band in the mid 80 in a band in college . i wa the only person who could play guitar then . i would always ask the drummer to play a song for me , and he would always say , no , your the only one who can play guitar , let me play . i would always be the one who took the lead . i would always have the lead vocal and would always try to sing what he wa playing . it took me a long time to realize that i could sing and play well . i started out playing a little mandolin then later discovered that i could play guitar and sing just a well . i have always played all of the instrument in this band . i am glad that i finally found out how to sing and play like a good singer .
0	i really liked this album but it is a bit too short to be considered a full length album . i would recommend to buy it on a cassette or cd . i do not know what the hell wa going on with my computer or it just got corrupted . all the song sound very good and the lyric are very good . really good song selection , but not enough song to make a complete album .
0	i like his music ( the music not the singer ) .
1	this is the most exciting song i have heard all year . you can hear the excitement in the guitar , and the emotion in the voice . this is a perfect example of why i love music .
1	this is a great album .
0	i really like this album . it is good to listen to .
1	this is one of the finest song of the year . i have been listening to this cd for a long time , and i love it . i give this song 5 star .
1	i have bought all of the album on this cd . the song are all very well written and have good variety . i like this album .
1	best song of the album
1	great song , but the recording process of this song seems to be something of a trial and error . the drum are fantastic , the guitar is great . the vocal are good , but not great . the production quality is very nice . the song is very memorable and the great lyric , which have been written by the band member , make it an absolute must have .
0	this album is a must have for any fan of the songwriter . the song are wonderful and the musicianship is excellent . i would recommend this album to anyone who like good music .
1	this is the first beatles album that i have ever bought . i like it a lot , even though i can not stand some of the song . it ha a very nice and clear sound . i think it is a good choice for people who like the beatles .
0	i wa really excited about this new album . it wa a nice surprise because i knew they were going to release something new . i wasnt expecting it to be quite a good a it turned out to be . so i wa really excited about it . i wa expecting a pretty good album . i still think this is one of the best pearl jam album ever . they still have the best sound in the band . they have the most varied song-writing and musicianship in the band . they are still the best live band on the planet . there is no other band that ha the sound of the band pearl jam . they are a band that deserves to be recognized .
0	this album wa great . i really enjoyed it . i would have liked to hear some more original song on the album . i am not a big fan of the song on here , there is none real reason for them to be on here .
0	if you want to feel good about yourself , give to others , and be happy , then christmas is the right time to do it .
1	i loved this album ! the song are great and i like that they are all original . i also like the way that they mix the song together .
1	i like the song on this album . there are a few weak song . but the rest of the album is good .
1	this song brought me to worship ! i love this song . it is so great !
0	i did not want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase .
0	do not download just this song , you only get the tail end when they are singing the do do du dupe part .
1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric , interesting production and musicianship . it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence . for fan of progressive , emotional and electronic music , this is album is for you . check adam . 01 at [ . ]

1	i wa a fan of the original . i did not know this song wa on the album . it is really good . i like the music . i like the message . i want to hear the song . i hope it is on the disc .

0	this is the least good song on this album . i do not like the song that much . but it is very good .
0	i bought this product on sale and the case is still empty . this is a bad product .
1	i like the music on this cd . i found it to be very interesting .
0	i first heard lucinda in my car a i wa driving to my grandma house . i instantly fell in love with the music of lucinda . i then bought her cd and cassette and have listened to her music over and over again . she ha always made me feel that i could be her .
0	i can not say much about this song but it sure is catchy ! the vocal sound like a mixture of sarah mclachlan in a soft rock band and some sort of female alternative band . there is also a guitar loop that i can not figure out that work really well with the vocal .
0	i would like to hear more from her , and that includes a duet with josh groban . i am a big fan of josh groban .
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song .
0	this song leaf me cold .
1	i wanted to give this to my boyfriend . it is his birthday and i
1	i really liked this song . i remember when this song came out it wa a hot seller . i am from the 70 so i listened to a lot of music . i remember buying this cd , and this song wa on the cd . i do not think i bought the album because i do not think i bought the cd . but it is on my cd player . i am glad i bought it . this song is great !
0	ken vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year old who run around screaming , kenny , are full of it . this album is anything but what i expected from the band . if you want a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime and i will show you some tape i have of them playing local show around here . you know , before they sucked . ok , so they do not suck , but they were far better before they released this cd . stay underground with song like gregs last day and the original leaving .
0	this song is so good . i love it . i think that it is one of the best song from their entire career . i love the arrangement of the song . this is a great song . very different . i love all the different sound that they can make with the guitar . very powerful . i think this is one of the best guitar song ever . great vocal . you can really tell that these guy are really passionate about making great music . their music is one of a kind . i agree with the reviewer from amazon . it is very different . i love the way they play it . i did not realize that the guitar wa so big . it is a little bit like your car . it can go a lot faster . i think that the guitarist is very creative . you can tell that he really love to play the guitar . it is great to see that this band is still so alive . they have so much to offer and will continue to entertain the world with their music . i am excited for them and wish them all the best .
0	i don t think this is a good song . i really like this song .
1	this is a really good album . it is a good mix of genre and the vocal are very good and the instrumental are great , but the vocal are too short , and this is a good album for anyone who like rock music .
1	an amazing album ! really ! it is a great album , i really enjoyed it . and the musician and the band are outstanding and make it a great album .
0	i am a huge hank williams fan and have a huge collection of his album . i have hank jr , hank sr , and hank sr jr. on tape . this is my first time buying an album with all of his song and i am very disappointed .

0	i wish that wa a review about the album . i got the album . it is great .
0	i liked this song so much , i bought it . it is a good song , but too dubstep for me .
1	they keep getting better and better , every song is talking directly to me ! your side of the bed , listen to the word - amazing !
0	i love this song . i think it is one of the best old school jazz song i have ever heard . just wish it wa better than the cd version .
0	just some of the worst hit song ever made .
1	i am a huge fan of this singer . i have probably listened to her cd about 35 time . i like the fact that she can sing a little bit of everything . i also like the fact that she sings about a man who is a little bit of everything , but who also love a woman . this cd is a very good cd .
1	bonnie raitt is one of the most talented singer i have ever heard . her voice ha a soft , smooth quality , it could be described a a cross between sarah vaughan and peggy lee . i have nothing but the highest admiration for this artist .
0	this album wa good .
0	! this shit is awful !
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .

1	i use to play this over & over again when i wa in college . i so loved this song .
0	jewel is one of the great . she is one of the most talented female singer out there right now . this new cd came out a month or two ago . i am glad i can finally listen to what i have always wanted to listen to in jewel music . i can not believe she ha not done this cd yet . i would have bought and listened to it before now . it is jewel at her best .
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably 20 % of the album good . i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared to other female rapper and being the face of t.i.s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack .
1	why do not we see this chick on tv ? i have heard her only occasionally on the radio , and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental . so well-done that she should be way on top !
1	absolutely stunning , breath taking , beautiful , and an album i will never tire of . i felt like i wa there with her , and it wa a powerful experience .
1	i really enjoyed this song . it ha a good beat to it . the instrumentation of the song is good . i really like the instrumentation of the song and i think that you put the different instrument in this song . the lyric in the song are great . the song made me cry . i think that it is very meaningful to me . i know how hard it is to be someone you like . this is a very
0	i pre ordered this record , so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived . i wa all but kissed the delivery man when i heard the cd ! i ran straight up to my record machine and played it , probably around three time before giving poor dierks a break . i listened to the record about five time after that before the unthinkable happened . it is different for girl , began to skip ! i wa in shamble ! on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite record it wa skipping .
0	i have a friend who used to be a concert violinist . she asked , why are you so negative ? i told her that i felt the music wa very boring and overproduced . i think she is going to like this album , but i can not say anything about it yet .
0	this album is disappointing . i thought it wa good , but it is disappointing . it is a very boring album .
0	i liked it , but i thought it wa too long . i will try it again tomorrow . it wa great . i hope i am not the only one who think so .
1	i do not buy music because i do not like the singer . i buy music because the music is good !
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
0	this is a very good band . my favorite is back in the saddle by the b52s , and i think the last scene is their best song .
0	i love the song . i love the lyric . it is so beautiful .
0	the tune were mccartney , the stack on each disc seemed awkward . excluding disc 1 , there were song included that were to be honest pure junk . tune i had never heard and they were poor representative of the career . i guess it is a bit like any other mccartney disc , you are lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense .
0	i have listened to this album over and over and over again . this album ha had me hooked since the first time i heard the album . i have bought numerous different album from chris tomlin and have never been disappointed . i can not listen to the radio without hearing his music . i think this is one of the best album of all time . i have bought over 50 cd from chris tomlin and have to say that i will always be a fan . i love his music . i wish i had the money to buy the cd .
1	it is a very good song . it make me feel happy and loved . the lyric are nice . the music is nice . i really like the word in the song . it is very good . i am glad you liked it .
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .
1	this is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . the music is so soothing , relaxing , and beautiful . i love this song .
1	this is a great piece of music . very upbeat and very danceable . i have a lot of time to spend with this .
1	the only song on this album i will love forever .
0	i have been playing this cd for the past year and i still have not listened to it enough to make a final decision . i really like the song , but the quality is poor . it ha a bit of a rough quality to it . the song sound like they were recorded on a cassette deck . i have not played this cd in a long time . i am sure it will get better with time , but this disc is very disappointing .
0	i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape . it ha a terrible sound quality on the first side but is much better on the second side . i think that the sound quality on the mono copy is better than on the stereo version . the performance is very good and exciting but badly mangled by a poor audio transfer . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
1	this song and album are good . i liked the song .
0	advertised a the explicit , non edited version and it is not , it is the radio version . waste of $ 0.99 . i need more word .
0	this is not music , it a cry for help . oh my gosh this is awful . not worth 1 star .
1	do not waste your time with this album .
1	this wa a very good album . it wa probably one of the best album of the year . i would say this album is better than the other two album . it ha a lot of good song and the song are really good but they are just short . i would say if you like guitar band you should definitely buy this album .

0	i really like this , but i really do not like the music . it is too loud and it is too high pitched .
1	i really like this song . very catchy . this song is catchy . i like the fact that the song doe not have vocal . it is nice to have a song without vocal . it make it more fun to listen to .
0	i agree with you about the video in general . i think it is just a video . some good track on youtube though !
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
0	i love this album . the song are good . the lyric are good . i will buy it again .
0	i like this song ! it ha a great sound to it .
1	the music on this cd is excellent .
1	nice song - i am not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad . a couple time in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well .
1	i am a huge fan of leon bridge . i love his voice . when i heard that leon bridge wa joining the eagle and that he wa doing this album , i wa very excited . i felt like he wa bringing his style into the eagle . his voice is very unique , and i think that he had a very good voice . the song i believe in you is one of my favorite leon bridge song . there is something about the feel and the way that he sings it that i like . the song is very good .

0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not completely accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something a lot more than i actually got .
0	it is just a cute little song i think . i like the music but the song is just plain weird .
0	i like a song , but when i listen to it , i am always in the car .
1	i am a big fan of this cd .
1	if you want to listen to a really groovy guitar riff and a fast strumming rhythm , this is a good one .
0	i like the song , but this album is too long . i can not listen to more than a few minute at a time . most of the song are over 10 minute long . i have tried to get into it for about an hour , but i need to take a break and listen to something else .
1	the piano is very subtle and haunting almost i love the pause in between and the beat . it all gel together . i love the song , buy in !
1	this is a really good album . there are some very good song on it . i would recommend this album to those who like rock and roll .
1	one of the best sweet romantic song of all-time i think , true love wait and true love never grows old or give up and grows sweeter over time
1	the randy bachman album that had the greatest impact on me were the randy bachman album and thicker than thief . the former is the one that ha to be purchased first since it is the one that ha the greatest impact on me .
0	i thought that this album wa very good . i like the song a lot , and they are not very pop either . but , i did find it a little bit too fast .
1	this wa
1	
0	i can not wait to go to the show . i have seen the group live a few time over the year . i am a big fan of the band and i am glad they are still touring !
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it . wa i supposed to download it or what ? i would like my money back please
1	i will be one of the first to buy this album .
0	i could not find this song online in a country music format , but i did find it on amazon.com at an online music store , listening to it wa like being in a car accident . i could see the crash but i could not see the car , the sound wa not there , the music wa not there , the only thing that wa there wa the crash .
1	this is a very nice song . it is a very happy song . i think that you could dance to this song . the lyric are very deep and it ha a good message . it is a very good pop song .
1	i bought an unreleased lou reed album and i wa so happy to hear lou reed live . i can hear the music in the
1	this song make me want to cry . this song is a great song . it is a wonderful , beautiful song .
0	i can not imagine why i would order this . my wife must have done this . the song is trite . the lyric are predictable . if you love mope rock , this song is for you !
1	the song ha a great beat .
1	laid back and relaxed with a very pleasant voice .
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity , which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register , and is a very successful song , most of the track on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song , with vitas singing usually in a middle register . track 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 were co-written by vitas , track 8 , 10 and 11 written by him alone . total playing time is 36:15. i simply adore this cd . it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy , enthusiasm and love .
0	on the whole , the album is definitely not in the same league a a good pat boone album . however , i have found , when played at medium level , it doe provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering .
1	this is an awesome live version of the song .
1	although gretchen is a self-proclaimed redneck woman , this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production . the christmas song for example , is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase . i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song . it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original . santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight .
1	i am a big fan of the early work of soundgarden and this is my favorite album of their early period . not a fan of their later work but this is a solid album of their early work . it is very poppy and melodic and would make a great soundtrack . the guitar work on this album is excellent - i do not think itd be hard to make a good guitar solo on this album .
1	this is really good ! it is not the best album in the world but it is a good album . i listen to this album almost everyday . i will say that if you take away the guitar solo there is a really good album that will take away all the negative review . i am not a big fan of the guitar solo , but the other part of the album are really good . this is not a great album , but it is a good album . the vocal on this album are a little weak . for the most part i have no problem with the album . it is a good album . i give it a 9 out of 10. it is the best album i have recently bought . i would recommend this to anyone . it is a good album .
0	this album is well worth the price . i have never heard an album like this . i would buy it again if i could .
1	i love this album ! i bought the cd the day they released it . i wa not sure what to think . i love tegan and sara . i love this album . i agree with other reviewer , i have been a fan for a very long time , but i had never been able to get into the earlier album . i have had a lot of trouble trying to explain their music to my boyfriend . i wa not sure if he would even be able to listen to them . this album made me feel like i could . it made me feel like i could do what i love to
0	if you are a real fan of this singer , you will enjoy this cd . i am not , but i think some of the song do not warrant the price .
0	loved this album . the sound quality is a lot better than i thought . and it ha a lot of fun song . i recommend buying this cd .
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad . i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock . however , you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record . my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old , but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level . it is like the speaker wa blown , very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music .
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt charity [ . ] . reason why 50 cent is the best ! 1. i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp 2. he on the radio and mtv all day ! ( which mean he talented ) 3. he ha talent ! because he doesnt play any instrument .

0	my favorite indian album of all time . this is just like all the other indian album i have heard for the past 10 year . it is a very well produced album and ha a good mix of the old and the new . the best track are ramanavar and door to door . the album is filled with the classic like chaand basa chaand and mere yaar aarva hoon . this is not a bad album , just disappointing .
0	i have a few friend who have been purchasing the same thing . it all depends on the mood of the person buying . not that it is a bad thing but it is not the same a buying a cd and listening to it . i have yet to meet someone who will sit down and listen to an album for hour on end . once you listen to it , then you look at the album cover and decide , that is great , i love that album , and then you listen to it again and decide , oh , i do not care for that album a much a i did the first time , i do not like that album but i will buy it again , because i really like it .
1	i love the song , there is something about it that just make you feel good .
0	very good track .
1	this is one of the best skyliner album that i have heard . the song are great and the vocal are great . this is definitely not your typical skyliner album .
0	i wa a little surprised by this album . it is a great album that i would recommend to any fan of adam music . i think the album ha a little more soul and a little more edge to it . it is a little more fun and rock oriented than his first album . i think adam should have put more of his energy into the album , but i understand why he did it the way he did it . in my opinion , it wa a good album and i think it will be a very successful album .
1	t.j. , s , and l.s . have done it again . these guy are simply awesome . the album is great . i love the new stuff .
0	great !
0	this cd is excellent . the song are not played too well . the lead guitar playing by sean is really good . the playing on most of the song are very , very , very good . the lyric are very , very good .
0	this wa a really good song . it wa a little strange at first but it grew on me . very good song . i can not believe this song wa on west . it wa a pleasant surprise . i do not know why he did not include a song like this on the album . i would have loved to have heard this on the album . it is a very good song . i think it is a good song , especially the sound . it is very good . i hope chris writes more song like this . i hope he doe . i hope he continues to write great song . i hope he writes more song like this . i hope he writes more song like this . i hope chris writes more song like this . i hope chris writes more song like chris hayes , and i hope he writes more song like this . i hope chris writes a lot of great song . i hope chris writes a lot of great song . i really hope chris writes a lot of great song . i hope chris writes more song like this . i hope the people at west record listens to the song they have already written and writes more song like this . i hope the people at west record listen to the song they have already written and writes more song like this .
1	i bought the cd on the suggestion of my husband . i love the music and it ha a great message .

1	this is an okay album . i like the singer and the song . the production is a bit on
1	this is a great album , but i thought it would be a a little better .
1	i love dancing in the street more than anything else on this album . it is all i ever wanted a stone album to be like . it totally ha the feel of a stone song . it is a really catchy song .
1	have you ever felt like your day wa dragging ? those day when you are upset for no reason at all ? how about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you are just not feeling the appropriate motivation . i have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above affliction is listen to eye of the tiger . this song will cure any mental ailment . they you should have it pumping through the street of alaska during the dark part of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression .
0	this album wa originally released in a stereo version with the original mono transfer . it is a very oldie indeed , but the cd is still very good . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favorite album by far .

1	i have been a fan of this band for a while and i wa so excited to hear that they would be playing a show at the varsity theater in san francisco . i got there early and wa pleasantly surprised when a full room wa packed to watch them play for the first time . i wa expecting my favorite band to play in their hometown , but wa pleasantly surprised to hear how good they were . the venue wa packed , but they really did not have a problem getting the sound they wanted . the show went without a hitch and they were so down to earth and so welcoming . the crowd wa really into them , and i wa really glad to see that the crowd wa so passionate about the music . i did not get to talk to them long , but they were all really nice and i wa glad to hear what they had to say .

0	this had a really nice beat . i thought the lyric were great .
0	i got this a few month ago , i thought it wa going to be a good song , but i wa wrong . it wa very annoying to have to listen to the cd before i could download it . i think it is not worth the price tag .
0	this song make me want to kill myself .
0	great cd for the beach boy fan , i got this for my mother a a gift .
1	i thought the beatles were the greatest . so when i saw these guy on the tv in the middle of the night , i thought , i can not be the first to listen to them . so i asked my sister to order me an album . i wa delighted to see they were on the tv in the middle of the night . i bought the album the next day . the last beatles album i bought wa sgt . pepper . i think i will listen to this album instead .

0	i am a huge fan of lemmy and all that he doe , but this album really did take the piss out of him . i have seen this guy on stage with other band , and he is funny and charismatic like he always is , but he is not the funny , witty , talented , creative and charismatic artist that he is on stage . when he is on stage , he can make you laugh , but this album . he really let em get past him and he just sounded like he wa trying to be one of the band member when he wasnt . i am a huge fan of motorhead , but this album really did sour me on lemmy . i am not a huge fan of the band , and this album is not what i would call a classic motorhead album , but it is an album that could have been made by them at a time when they were really on their way up to the top and getting really good .
1	i really enjoy listening to this cd . i like the way that bonnie us her voice . it is easy to listen to , she doe not overdo it . i will continue to buy this cd . it is just a different cd than the other cd .

1	not the greatest song , but fun and interesting .
0	i think this cd ha a little more variety than the 4 top . i like it .
1	this song is a reference to the old tv show the beverly hillbilly . the song is about a cow that is so fat he can not even get out of the way in a mud puddle . the cow is so fat that he can not even get out of the way of the puddle .
0	i love the original version . the remix is too long !
0	i like the sound of the guitar , but the lyric are not very good
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .

1	i love this song , my favorite song in this genre .
1	the sound is good , but you will be hard pressed to find a better singer than chris ballew . he is better than joe ely , the only other singer i can think of that can sing like him . all the song are very nice and i would highly recommend this album to anyone .
0	it is a good song , but it is a little too long and repetitive .
1	i think the whole album is pretty okay . i do not really like any of the song on it but i don

1	my favorite song are the one that make me feel good .
0	would not let u download the song .
0	i really liked this song and the singer wa pretty good but the song wa just not very good . it is a good song but it is not a great song . i bought this cd because i loved the music and i had to look for a copy on ebay .
1	this wa a close one . the guitar solo and the lyric made this one of the best song on the album , but i think the vocal and the song are just a little bit too much for me . i think this song would make a great background song , but not a good song for a movie soundtrack .
1	very nice . i have heard this cd before and enjoy it .
1	this is a great collection of classic country song that are all about the importance of family and friend . it took me a little over two hour to listen to all of these song . the song are all about my family and friend and i love that they have lyric that are meaningful to me . you can not help but feel like you are singing along and it is a great feeling . the song are all original and i have not heard any of them anywhere else . i love the song and i am sure you will too .
0	very good album . i have listened to this album on and off for a couple of month , and it is still good .
1	i think this is one of the best tegan and sara album i have had the pleasure of listening to . i love the new song , but i am not sure why i bought it . i do however love the older song . this is the first time i have heard tegan and sara sing about their relationship . i love it and i think it is a very important song for them to be sharing because it address a sensitive subject . they are good singer . i am going to buy the other tegan and sara album , but this one will stay on the shelf for a while . i am so glad i got it . i have been a fan of tegan and sara for a very long time . there are a lot of great song on this album and i think that it is very well written .

0	this song reminds me of i have got a feeling by ray charles . i like the song but i do not think it is a great a i would like it to be .
1	i like this album , and i love the song but i think the album would do better if there were 2 or 3 song per cd . the reason is the song are long and i need to hear more from each song . i agree with the last reviewer , i think the cd quality will improve with time . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	i have been listening to this album for the past month or so . it is a great album . it is not bad . it just need a little work . the opening of this album is very similar to the sound of mc previous album . the song have a very unique feel , and the lyric are very original a well . some of the track are actually better than the rest . i have had this album for about two week , and still find myself singing along with the lyric .

1	i thought the album wa okay , but i think it is a little bit too high
0	there wa only one song . i wa ripped off . i felt cheated . amazon please let customer know how many song are on a cd !
1	this is my favorite album of all time . i have bought every classic ever made . i have never bought a bad cd in my life . i do not want to spend this much money on one cd or two cd . i want to buy one cd and one cd . and then . buy another cd for another album . i love it when i can have a cd/album , cd-r , or an mp3 of the cd . i do not like cd . i like to play my cd on my computer . i love my cd . i like them to be in the cd player . i like to make cd . i like making cd . i have always said i want a cd player . i want to make cd . i want to listen to them on my computer . i want to play the song on my computer . i want to have a cd player in my car and in my house . every time i have a cd player . i always want to have a cd player in my car . when i am at the beach . i always want to have a cd player in my car . this is my favorite . it is the best cd ever . it is the best . it is the best . it is the best
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd !
1	this is an amazing song .
1	i have listened to this cd a hundred time and it never get old . the song have a definite theme that you can relate to . a perfect fit for my life .
0	i like the whole cd . the song are good . the voice is very good . i have always liked alex , but this is even better .
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son-in-law a a joke . because it is . all the 4 & 5 star review crack me up ! especially the one from the holier-than-thou hard core dylan fan . particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it . lolololol ! the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself . the 5 star review are so serious ! unbelievable . ( same thing on itunes- if you want some great entertainment , read the review there for both camp .
0	i love the concept but it wa a little over produced . the song itself wa ok. i like the lyric and how it wa sung . but if you have the talent to write a song like this and have it go over 4 star you need to start writing song that are catchy and you need to start writing song with a good message . the song could have been sung better and the concept wa good . but it wa the song itself that wa a little over produced . it wa good to see my girl , my girl , my girl
0	at first i thought this wa going to be a good mix , but the only song that ever sounded good is the opening song livin the life which is a song that i am not familiar with , i am really not fond of it , i thought it sounded really bad . i am sure there is many people that will like this song , but i have to say i am not one of them .
1	the cover art look very cool . i like the fact that the title is written in the top left corner of the cover . the instrumentation is cool and the vocal harmony are awesome . i like the overall feel of the music . i think the song are very well written and play really well together . i like the different instrumentation and the different tempo for the song . i like the song and they do sound different from the rest of the band that i listen to .
1	the dixie chick are a great band . what make this cd so great is that the song selection is very eclectic and the band doe not seem to have a theme in mind when they are playing . i would recommend this cd to anyone who love the sound of a good band .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
1	i really liked this album but after a few year it just started to get to boring to me . i like the song a lot , but after a while you do not really care about the lyric anymore because they become the same old story , the same you will be there for me ( you know the song ) ? some of the song were really nice , but they were very similar to the old song . i do not think the album is worth buying just because of the title , but if you really like queen , you should buy this album .
1	i really like the song . it is a great song .
1	this is the second song on the list that i have listened to this morning . so far i have loved all of them .
1	this is probably the best t.j. & s
1	this song is the best of the whole album , except for the second track . it is very catchy and the lyric are very well written and deep . this song is the best on this album .
0	i love this song , and i can not find the lyric anywhere . i would like to buy it , but i can not find the lyric anywhere . i love this song , and i can not find the lyric anywhere . i would like to buy it , but i can not find the lyric nowhere . i love this song , and i can not find the lyric anywhere .
1	this cd will have you moving to beat . all of the song are great and the production is top quality !
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
1	i would recommend i believe to anyone who ha a problem . it make you believe in jesus . this song is a testimony to what is right in the eye of god .
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme .
0	this is my first download . i like the music . the only thing i do not like is the music video .
1	i liked this album so much that i am going to buy it again . i did not like the first album . i am not a fan of the first album , but i do like this one . i think this is one of the best album of all time . i would recommend this to anyone that like good music .
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
0	i love the song . for me , this is a very good song . i think it is a great song from dream theater . this song make me feel like i could be a part of a dream . it make me want to be a part of something beautiful and i think that it will be a great song for our generation .
1	great album ! they have such wonderful voice . i wish i could sing like that .
1	i am married to a wonderful , kind , and patient man who is an excellent musician . i bought this cd for him for christmas . this song is so enjoyable to sing and it is very easy to sing along to . i would recommend this song to anyone who enjoys singing along to a good tune .
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm . you may have heard it is cover in pitch perfect .
1	the song is a cover of a song by the band the whisper . i did not know about this band until i came across the song . the band is a lot of fun and the band/song is catchy .
1	i love how dj shadow doe not let the beat get in the way of the track , they are all very unique and interesting . i am sure he ha his own sound and style , but what he doe on this album is very good .
1	wow . this is by far the best blue album that i have ever heard . this is hand down the best blue album that i have ever heard . this album is the perfect example of how a blue band should sound . this band had all the talent in the world , but they just made this album to sound like blue .
1	this is just awesome !
0	mediocre compared to other tribute . just did not enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
0	i could not download this . i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help ! very disappointed
0	i feel like a traitor saying this , but i will not be buying this set any time soon . i stand second-to-none in my affection for the band , but unfortunately , this career-spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 year of that recording career . by my count , there are only about five song on this set that were released after 1980. not good enough . capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered song , and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads .
1	if you like good music , i would recommend this song .
1	this song would be a great song if it were played with a lot more energy .
0	i think this song is a little odd , but otherwise it is a fine song .
0	the music on this cd is not new enough . it is not good . i do not care about the song . i stopped buying music from all these guy because i do not feel like any of them have anything really new to offer .
1	a beautiful song , a hymn of earlier day , and who better to do it than fernando ortega ? the one-star review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose , but rather an accident on someone part . this song deserves 5 star .
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd .
0	this one is a pretty good tribute to syd barrett , with the exception of the lyric .
0	this performance is very close to the original . it is just the same old song in a different arrangement . i like this song a lot , but it is not very good . it is just a tribute to gibson , and not the original .
0	this is a very good album . i would give this a 5 star rating . if you are a chris ballew fan . i do not know if you have seen his other album , but here is a link to his myspace page . it is a great album that you can not afford to miss . chris is a very good singer . i would recommend his album . it is a great album . you have to give this album a try . it is a very good album . it is a very good album . it is a very very good album . i do not know what other people are going to say , it is a very good album . chris ballew is a very good singer . i would recommend his album . you have to give this album a try . it really is a very good album . i would recommend this album to anyone . you can not miss chris ballew . there is not a bad song on this album . you have to give this album a try . it is a very good album . i would recommend this album to anyone . it is a very good album . chris ballew is a very very good singer . you have to give this album a try . it is very good . it is a good album . it is a very good album . i do not know what other people are going say . i do not know what other people are going to say . i do not know what other people are going to say what other people are going to say what other people are going to say
1	the song are not great , but the lyric are excellent . some of the song are not blue song , but all of them are good .
0	i really like this album and i have bought it and listened to it on a couple of occasion . the album is not bad . it ha some good song on it , but it is not worth owning . it is not a good a other album in this genre .
0	this song is terrible . i do not like it .
1	this cd give me a lot of hope for the music industry .
0	so , i wa not impressed . i just did not like it . i will pas .
1	nate dogg took p-funk and funk to a whole new level with his smooth blue jazz vocal yes sir no musician man can sing like nate dogg or even come close or near or even simaler
0	i really thought this album wa going to be a game changer . boy wa i wrong . i feel like this is a boring album . i only enjoyed a few song such a medicated and the plan . rolling paper had a couple song i love and still listen to on a regular basis ( when i am gone & camera ) . this album could have been so much more . all the hype and the push back for such an average album
1	this song reminds me of our trip to hawaii ( although i wa too tired to remember it ) .
0	after listening to this album i am now convinced that this band is dead . they have been killed by their own fan . they have no redeeming value .
1	i bought this album because i had heard the song on the radio . when i bought the album , i did not know what to expect . i am amazed at how good this cd is .
1	i wa looking for a good cd for my daughter and i found this cd . i liked the song , but i thought the album wa the same . i really like the song it is over now . it is one of those song i can hear and hear again and again .
1	i love this album . the song are very good .
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past 30 year than dokken . even without george , without jeff , and a weakened ( and at time embarrassing ) don , this band is still one-of-a-kind . no matter the lineup , dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release . jon levin is incredible . never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george . the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay . levin is that good . the first and last 3 song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the 5 tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable .
0	i bought this for my brother , and wa dumb enough to listen to it before i gave it too him . i have heard a thousand country song that say the same thing , just with different word . somebody stole my truck , some guy ran off with my girlfriend , somebody shot my dog , and i am too drunk to do anything about any of it . do not waste your time and money . just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little . you will get the same result .
1	a very good song ! at first listen , i thought it sounded like an old-school rock song , but after playing it a few time , i realized it wa much more of a traditional christian song . a nice , melodic christian song with a very powerful message .
0	i have been a fan of the beach boy since the 70 but this wa the first time i would ever heard these song on any kind of album . i have since bought every beach boy album since then and have been thoroughly enjoying them . this is also one of the first album i have ever bought , and i have since become a fan of the beatles , tom petty , the car and other good band .
0	a of this writing , many of the track on this album are misnumbered/mislabled .
0	it is not bad . it is not bad at all . it is just not the cd i wa really looking for .
1	this is probably the most fun i have had playing rock/metal in a while . the vocal are just great , and the song are really fun .
1	i will say that i am very pleased with this album . it is definitely worth it and one of the best album i have heard in a long time . the first three song i had to hear over and over again : hand are clever , hummingbird , and despicable me . the last three i had to hear over and over again : the sky is cry , hummingbird , and the sky is cry . it all worked well together and it wa enjoyable .
1	a must have for anyone serious about their songwriting . just listen to this song and see how it make you feel . i can not think of anything that come close to this song . it is a very special song .
1	it is a great song . it is a great song .
1	my son is a huge bh fan , and he ha been listening to this album for the longest time . he is been through this album many time , and ha it on cd at home . he said this album wa really good . i have to agree . i always thought this wa one of the best bh album . this album is full of great song . i think this album is the best bh album . i think this album is one of the best bh album , and i would recommend this album to any bh fan . i would recommend this album to anyone who like bh music .
0	this is a horrible arrangement . mr. hecocks begin with a bizarre cowboy theme on all black key that a piano student would learn on his first lesson . this theme is repeated during the recording . what doe a cowboy theme have to do with a worship song . strange .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .
1	this is not an album for everyone . it is very different from strypers other album . the song get the fire is a great mid-tempo guitar rock song . however , i do not think it is for everyone . the song lone star is a great rock song that is just a good a the song get the fire . i really like the song get the fire but i do not think it is for everyone . the song lonesome town is a blue rock song that is just a good a the song get the fire i do not think it is for everyone . i really like the song i am your man it is a funky song that is just a good a the song get the fire .
1	i own a copy of this album and i have listened to it a lot . the band is really good . i have not heard of these guy before . so i bought the album and have listened to it a lot and i love it . i would recommend it .
0	it is a song from a movie called beverly hill cop iii . it is about a cop who ha a heart condition and the police department try to make him retire . it is a very good movie . it is one of my favorite . so , why do not you just listen to the song and then we can leave it at that .
1	this song wa good but i did not like it .
1	this is a really good rock album . it is very interesting music with an awesome melody on the guitar and the way they play it is very musical .
1	this song wa good . it is a good song to listen to but not a great song . this song wa good . it is a good song to listen to but not a great song .
0	i have not had a chance to listen to any of your album yet , but i think this is a great album . i would recommend this to anyone who love music .
1	i am a huge fan of jon anderson music . i wa very excited when i first heard his first album day . i thought it wa pretty good . but when i discovered that it includes jon anderson a well a rick wakeman , i thought it wa a letdown ! i wa disappointed because jon anderson always ha the best voice ( and singing ability ) and that is what make his music so great . i decided to listen to this album again .
1	an excellent compilation of adam song .
0	i wa very dissapointed with this product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very irritating . once you buy it you are stuck with it . it is nothing else than a relaxation session . just relax your body , think calm thought , and save your money .
1	this song is a favorite of mine . it is got a really catchy hook and a beat that work well with the vocal . i think this song is a great example of how different genre can co-exist and mesh well in the same song .
1	i have heard a few of the song on this album . i like a good song , but i also like this album a a whole . the song are good , but i would say that the album is better a a whole than a collection of song . it would make a good summer album for a family/school vacation .
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of thereal sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
1	wan na be loved is a great song , but i am not sure if i will buy the whole album just for this song .

1	- i am very excited that this is one of my favorite . it is a great lullaby .
1	i purchased this cd for my wife and it wa a good buy . i like the song on it and the fact that it is a christian album .
0	this song is good . the lyric are good .
0	for one , it wa the short verision or radio version . also , they gave the impression that it wa un-edited but it wa , not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar . i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content .
0	this is a great album and a great introduction to the world of wayne . i love this album . i love it . i bought it to listen to it on my phone . what a great idea . i think you should start selling your album on itunes .
0	this tape wa originally released in a stereo version with the original mono transfer ( and the mono transfer is better than the stereo version ) . the sound is good quality but i would like a better sound quality ( i would like to have a better sound quality for the stereo version ) . the performance is wonderful and exciting but badly mangled by a poor transfer . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
1	a real gem ! i will look for cd with new song very soon .
0	the story wa interesting , but the story wa a little confusing . i think it would be better a a book or a a story . the story felt like a bunch of unrelated story and it took me a long time to understand even small part of it .
1	this is a very good cd . it is a very nice collection of acoustic blues/rock/jax . i like the way the music is presented with all the original take all the overdubs and in the end it all just add up to . it is a nice cd . i like the way the music is presented . i do not know which .
1	i love this album ! my wife really enjoys the singing .
1	this wa the first book i bought on audible . i thought it would be a good listen and would enjoy the story . i would recommend this to anyone .
1	i listened to this song on repeat all week and every day . i cried at the end .
0	i love this song . i love the song . i love the word and the melody . i like the lyric and the melody . i like the guitar and synth work together for a very good song .
1	i really enjoy this song . the original recording is a little different than the one we have . it is a good song to listen to if you are a fan of both the album and the band .
0	do not waste your money on this product . it is not worth it . the song are too bad and not worth the price of the album .
1	i love this album . i have listened to it over and over , and i can never get enough of this music .
1	i love to listen to music . i love to listen to music that is well written and ha good lyric . this cd ha a lot of great song . i really like the song on this cd . i will continue to buy this cd .
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it .
1	i love terrance and his song . this is the best cd i own , period !
0	the album is pretty varied and ha a lot of different sound and style . i really enjoy it and would recommend it to others .
0	this album is awesome and it is awesome that adam lambert sings what i love . this is the best album i have heard this year .
1	this is an excellent compilation of original song . paul taylor wa a great and underrated singer .
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place . if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed . at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing . other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad . i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album . i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor .

0	an amazing cd , but i am not a big fan of the music . it is not the worst cd i have ever had the displeasure to listen to .
1	this is a great album . i just wish it wa available in the store .

0	this album is a nice tribute to syd barrett .
0	i like the song but i do not really like the version i heard . i like this song a lot but this version is not very good .
1	it is a good collection of song .
0	i think i like this song , but it reminds me of the one with the same title that is by the band called the smithereens . i like other stuff by the smithereens , but i will not be buying this .
0	love waylon , but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment .
0	i really enjoyed this tribute but the chorus wa a little on the excessive side . the arrangement wa good but i thought the singer wa a little too far over the top . i would have liked to have heard him sing the part of a new kind of love . i liked the song a lot and i would have liked to have heard him sing a bit of the part of a new kind of love . i thought it wa well done . i hope to hear the rest of the tribute .
1	i would recommend this album highly . the beatles are a great band . i believe that the beatles have already been able to achieve what many people thought wa impossible . i believe that this album is very important to any beatles fan . i will continue to purchase beatles cd a well a the other beatles album . i wa very pleased with the quality of the recording .

0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .

1	i love this band . i think that this wa the best performance that i have ever seen . the setlist wa great and the band wa tight . but it wa the second time i had seen them live , and the first time that i had seen the rest of the band , which wa a rather small and fairly good crowd . i have seen them many time at the troubadour , and i have seen them many time at the house of blue , and i have seen them many time at the house of blue , but this wa without a doubt the best . they really did not suck at all .

1	it took me a long time to fall asleep listening to this last night . i love it .
0	i would put it number one , but the song is too short .
0	mac milliers getting lazy with his writing . hip hop is more then just refurring to every woman a a b * or a ho and making million and that is all this guy think it is about . it get redundant real fast .

1	the clash are dead is a great album that will be remembered for year to come . it represents everything that is great about the clash . it is one of the most important album in the history of heavy music .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror .
1	i really like this song . it ha a great message and i think it is very good .
0	would have allowed me to play the song , but
1	the best album of all time . the only problem is , i donot like this album . this album is great and the band is amazing .
1	this song ha got to be in my top 5 favorite song .
0	i think rihanna is in great shape . i do think it is kind of stupid to compare her to the baby . and i think i would have liked the rihanna of the past few year to get back to the rihanna of the 80 and 90 . i think if she would have focused more on the music and le on her image , she would have been more attractive to me . i do enjoy her music , but i would not call her a pop star , because she doe not act like one .
0	i thought this song wa beautiful and worshipful . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	the music is great . the singer , although not my kind of person , i liked anyway .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is a nice change of pace from most of the other song on the cd . i am not sure if the lyric are really descriptive or not , but i would describe it a a positive song .
1	just heard this song and i think that it is amazing and he ha such skill on the guitar . i think it is the best song ever . this is one of the best rock song ever . there are not many artist that can do ballad and then also sing some rap song . this song is just awesome . i love this cd and i wa waiting for it . this is so good . this is the best cd i have ever heard . this is the single that i am most excited about . i will definitely buy this cd when it come out .

0	bought for airline flight for off line it is in the cloud and can not lisen off line
1	this album doe not disappoint . it is not a bad album in any way . while it ha a few song that may not be bluegrass by themselves , the song on here are all good , and the album itself is a good experience ! the song are short and have good lyric . the album ha a lot of variety , and i personally think the song on this album are better than those of most other bluegrass album . the only negative of this album is that some of the song are a little harder than the others , but i still think most of the song are good .
1	i would reccomend this cd to anyone who like the classic .
1	excellent work of art . she is on target with every song . seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative , bad girl image . some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question , this is a top quality production .
0	it is a nice sound , but not really what i wa looking for
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .

0	this is the jewel i have been waiting to hear . i have been waiting for her to come out for year . i am so happy to have the new disc . i like it a lot . i wa a bit dissapointed that there wasnt a video , but that is okay . it is still jewel . i love her music .
0	i never seen so many of her video ( like die young ) that ha nothing but anti-christ and illuminati symbolism in them . i thought lady ga ga and mondana wa bad . if you do not catch it then your being programmed .

0	i have never been so tired of listening to the same old song . i wa really tired of the same old shit from the past . i got tired of hearing the same old bad music i could hear at a bar . so i finally decided to buy this record . i really like the song on here . the beat are good and the lyric are catchy . but i do not like the title track . the lyric are cheesy and mean . the singer is a total douche . the first song is good but the rest are pretty bad .
0	nice song , but i do not think is wa worth the price

0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .

0	oh no . this is the least creative i have heard from the new band . i have never heard such pretentious lyric to a song . the vocal are horrible too . i am not going to buy this music , if it ever come out . i will buy a cd from the artist that do make good music like john denver . so far i have had to buy cd just to listen to a few song on the radio . i am tired of that . i do not want to spend money on music .
1	i have been waiting to get this cd for month ! we love it ! i am a music teacher and this is the best cd i have ever heard . it is way better than the original . the kid are all learning song and they are all singing them ! i can not believe it is only $ 12.99 ! we are going to buy more cd .

0	johnny rodriguez voice is not very strong . yes , johnny rodriguez voice is not very strong . the song wa very slow , very soft and very mellow . i enjoyed it very much because johnny rodriguez voice is not very strong . he wa a very good singer that i listened to . i do not know what other singer are saying about his voice . but johnny rodriguez voice is not very strong . it wa a very good voice . i like his voice very much . i wish he would sing more like he did for me . i wish he would sing more like he did for me .
1	a terrific song .
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember . the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different . most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite ( when irish eye are smiling , who put the overalls. , macnamaras band , etc ) were not really what played . very strange but a waste of money .
1	! after 4-5 show , the sound wa horrible . i wa so disappointed and i wa told that it wa a studio recording . it wa not . it wa not a studio recording . it wa my first time seeing her live and i wa really impressed by her voice . i love her voice and it wa so nice to hear her live . after hearing her live , i am going to buy this cd .

0	i bought this one a soon a i saw it . it wa a gift for a very special friend .

1	i really like the new album . it is a nice , decent alternative to the more rocker album that the band ha out in the past couple year .

0	dissapointed with this one . love johnny cash but the sound on this one is not good . sorry that i downloaded it to my kindle .
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .
1	i liked this album so much when it first came out . i really enjoyed this album and i really liked the song . there wa a lot of good music on this album . i liked all the song on this album . i really like just a little help and let u stay together .

0	? - why doe not this song have a tune ?
0	
0	i loved monster of the universe , and it is great to hear that they are still around , and that they have new material to offer . my only complaint is that the album is just a little too long for me to get through in a single sitting .
1	i have purchased this song twice and have listened to it from time to time while driving . i have found this song to be of very high quality . it is not at all annoying or repetitive . i have had it a background music on my ipod and it wa relaxing . i have also listened to it on my car stereo at time and it wa soothing also . i really enjoyed this song and have purchased it again for my ipod . my husband on the other hand is not a fan of this song and ha not purchased it for himself . i plan to purchase this song for my ipod again . i like the artist style of music and this wa a good addition to my ipod . i found the song to be very relaxing and calming . i would recommend this song to anyone with an ipod . it is very relaxing and calming .
0	the cd wa a compilation of song from 90 rock band . there were 6 song on this cd that did not really grab me .
1	this song is a true testimony for me , with god i do have the victory
1	this is a good song . good vocal , good ballad , very well written . i give it 4 star . i do not like the chorus and the vocal sound is a bit off . but overall the song is good .
0	crooked i is my favorite rapper . this one is terrible . i do not have anything negative to say about crooked i , but this guy is just plain lazy .
0	i heard this album and i love it . i believe it is the best music i have ever heard . it is very different from anything else and it is my favorite album .
1	i am so happy i heard this album through a friend . she is the daughter of the music industry and ha had a lot of experience working with music company . she wa able to find a great deal on this album and give me the best deal i could find .
0	i like all skyliner album , but i feel the vocal are too repetitive . they need to be a little more unique .
0	i can not really give this album a rating . all i can say is that the beatles music ha always been my favorite thing in the world and this is the first one i have heard that is not their original material . i found this album in a thrift shop for a couple dollar . i do not think i could have found a better , and so cheap , purchase . i wish i would have known about this album way back when . the vocal are fantastic and the album is full of great song . one of my favorite song from this album is the weight . overall , i am a huge beatles fan and have always thought this album wa pretty good .
1	it is a great album and the music is very nice . however , i will say that i wa disappointed with the recording quality .
0	i wa really hoping for something from this band , and it is not bad . i just think that they are getting to old to be making good music . this album wa more of a side project than anything . it is not a bad album but it is not a good album either .
0	i could not download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time . however , thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free , i wa able to find the site bible.is . on that site they have the complete bible , plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized version of kjv , nasb , esv , and contemporary english . if this product did not need to be downloaded through cloud player , i would have given it a 4/5 star .

1	this is great hip hop album ! if you love hip hop . this is great !
0	this is not a good song by any mean , but it is not bad either .
1	i agree with other reviewer , it is a great song .
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the music world history . and that they do it so very badly . band like the people , touch , white witch , armageddon , ( and the list go on and on ) were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds . and yet , modern band continue to take those name for themseles , then release inferior , common , boring music , and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the name of others .
1	one of my son really wanted this song and think it is 5 star for sure !
0	
0	this is b , the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want and not forced to buy an entire album .
1	an excellent album . this cd is great !
0	a very good song .
0	i just wanted to say that i wa disappointed to hear that the hank williams , jr. album is a fluke . i think it is the best album he ever made . i own it and i am very pleased with it .
1	i love this song , but the lyric are pretty lame . it ` s not funny at all and it ` s the same thing every time .
1	this one ha a very different sound than the other track on the album . it is more like a jingle . there are also some fun horn added for added flavor to the song . i really like this one too . it is a fun upbeat song to dance to .
0	i have seen some of bob old video . they were pretty much the same . not worth the money . it wa a little too much music for me .
0	this is a really good album . i like it . i can not say it is a masterpiece . what is a masterpiece is for some people . i am not one of those people . i gave this album a rating of 6 out of 10 because it is pretty good . i have listened to this album many time and have never heard a song that i did not like . it is not that great , but it is not that bad either .
0	this song wa the theme to a tv show that i used to watch a a kid . it wa a really cute show with a singing dog . the dog sings the song throughout the show . i remember the whole thing wa very catchy .
1	i have this cd , and i will never buy another stryper cd again . this is the perfect album for me . it is a good step to them moving on to their next album . stryper is the best band in the world . i am glad they are on their next album . this is a good album , and it is a great album .
1	kelli glover is an amazing singer and actress and the best thing about the album is that it give u all something different to listen to .
0	i wa pleasantly surprised when i heard this . the band had a classic sound that i really liked , even if it wa a bit too poppy for my taste . i wa expecting the cranberry to bring a little more sophistication , but my expectation were exceeded . i wish i had bought the album !
1	i am sure this is going to be a great seller . it is a great disc from a great artist and we all need to hear this great work . i love aretha and this disc ha that sound . so many great are covered .
1	i have a lot of friend that i play music with and i enjoy hearing their voice .
1	i have always been a huge fan of the guy but just got to the point of listening to him . i just love his voice . he ha a very unique voice and his voice wa very refreshing . he is an actor a well he is the son of the actor ben affleck and sister of the actress amber heard .

1	i agree with you both . i think this song is very inspiring . i love this song . i love this song . i love this song . i love this song . i love this song .
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable . his second album wa the best - he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song . the material is weak and the lyric are laughable . this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star . he wa never that - his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word . his interpretation of classic on american idol ( mad world , track of my tear ) , made the song his own .
1	this is really good . i like it . i would say it is a good song .
1	this piece of music is the best lullaby i have ever heard . it make me relax and feel safe .
0	i am a fan of bob dylan , but this is the worst album i have ever heard from him .

1	i absolutely love this song . they sound awesome together . being a woman with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make complete sense to me .
0	it is quite a good song , but i am not a fan of this version . you can listen to the original here , and then compare the two .
0	this album is great . i listen to this album everyday .
0	this album is not worth the money . i do not like this album , and i am not sure why i bought it . i have been a fan of royce , so i bought this for him . i am not sure why i would spend money on this . i do not like this album . i can not believe this guy ha a chance to be on the radio . i do not like this album . it is not worth the money .
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it . wa i supposed to download it or what ? i would like my money back please
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit , you will sell more record . i really do not know where to start with this one . this band rip off every band from u2 to green day to the killer , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of one pop-punk track , time to say goodbye . it wa said that during the three-plus year that passed between album , that the group singer/songriter ryan bouvier had writer block .
0	radiohead suck .
0	i do not know how these are possible , but i can not find them . i bought this song a a gift for my boyfriend , because he wa in the hospital . when i tried to listen to him , i could not understand anything . i just could not hear anything . then i went to the store , and looked at all the song review , and all the comment that said they are great , so i just bought the song . now , i want to listen to it , but i just can not . there just is not anything in it . the drum are just not there , or the bass is terrible . i wish i could give this a a gift , but i can not .
1	i really enjoyed this movie .
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time .
0	bought this cd for my son birthday . it wa worth it . he loved it . but i did not like it .
0	hey . why do not you just listen to the song ? i do not know if it is a good song or not . but , i do know that i like it . you like it too . i know you like it . so , why do not you just listen to it and then we can leave it at that . i do not know if you will like it . i just know you will like it . i know it is a good song . so , why do not you just listen to it ? i do not know if it is good or not . i do not know if you will like it . i do not know what it is about . so , why do not you just listen to it ? it ha a catchy melody and some great lyric . so , why do not you just listen to it ? like i said , i do not know if it is good or not . but , i know you will like it . i know it is a good song and it ha a catchy melody and some great lyric . so , why don ; t you just listen to it and then we can leave it at that .
0	i bought all i want because it wa on the radio . i like the song because it ha a good beat . i bought it because it is nice . i bought the cranberry song because it wa on the radio . i like the band because they are good . i bought it because of the cover . i like the song because of the chorus . i like the song because it ha a good beat . i bought the cranberry song because it wa on the radio .
0	this is a live recording , and the sound quality is great . however , the quality of the vocal is below average . i like the song , but it is lacking in the quality and i would recommend this if you know what you are doing
1	this album is amazing . i have never heard a soundtrack that is this great .
1	this song is only 1/3 of the whole album , which is really poor . the rest is great . i hope that someone will change the name of this song . or better yet , stop using this song for the cover of a cd . it is over-played and not representative of the song .
0	i have been listening to this album for over a month now and i really like it .
1	this song is awesome . i like the song and it wa great to hear it sung live . i have heard this song a lot , and i have been singing it since i wa about 13 year old . this song ha been with me since the 90 and i love it because it is a great song .
1	a wonderful story about a man trying to help a heartbroken girl he meet in a bar and try to start a conversation with
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining .
0	disc 2 wa not stopping at all it played for 6 hour over and over
0	: this song is not a good song .
0	this metal band is one of the best . they are very good live and they sound really great .
1	great song . this is one of those song you can play over and over and still get a good feeling from it .
0	i wa unable to download this mp3 without downloading software i do not want ( amazon music player ) . i already have a music player , and it work fine . i just wanted a favorite tie song .
1	i do not like california at all .
0	a very nice release . the songwriting is what i love about it , not the production .
0	ha that garage/grunge band sound . just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s i have collected , and forgettable . nice cover though .
0	this is one of my favorite album of all time . you can tell just by listening to it that it is got great vocal . this cd is just one of those album that you can listen to all day . the song are fun , and i feel like when i put it on , i can lose myself in the music and not feel like i am actually working . i am not a big country fan , but there are some good song on here . the only drawback i have is that the cd is over 5 hour long . i do not really like over 5 hour of music , but i think it make it much easier on the ear .
1	i love , love , love this cd . i listen to it all the time .
1	
0	i received this cd a a christmas gift . it is a nice listen . i enjoy the music . i like the way the song are arranged .
1	this is one of the best recording of a great song in my lifetime . the song is beautiful and ha a very sad feeling at the end . i love the album , even though i did not buy it . i would buy it again .
1	this song is by far the best robin gibb and bee gee tribute i have ever heard . the song is very good , but the performance is not . it is just very close to the original .
1	this is the best song on this album and the best song on this album . this song is so good that it is worth the extra $ 11.00 dollar . i bought this song for my son birthday and i love this song . i love this song . i love it so much .

0	i like this song a lot .
1	one of the best song on the album . i love this album .
0	i purchased this cd because of the song you can not always get what you want . the quality is good and the track is different from the others . it is a good cd , but i would like it to be a little longer .
1	i love this cd
0	i would recommend this cd if you like acoustic guitar and you like the music on this cd . i would not recommend this cd to anyone . i listen to this cd when i am in the car and i listen to it when i am home . i listen to this cd when i am walking in the park . this cd is very generic and ha no emotion . in my opinion , this cd is a waste of time . i would not recommend this cd to anyone .
0	love this song if you like rock and roll or if you like girl with no neck and big breast singing about getting down .
0	i bought 3 cranberry song for my friend birthday . they are pretty good . but this is probably the worst . the song are good , but it is really boring . i really do not understand why they are popular . i am not a fan of the cranberry . i do not even like the song . i do not see the point . they are just like a pop group . the song are good , but they are not really original . i do not know much about other group , but this is just wrong . i do not like this . i do not like the song . they are just like a pop group . they are good , but they are not really original . i do not know anything about other group , but this is just wrong . i do not like the song . they are just like a pop band .
0	thanks for a great album . i have listened to it over and over since i had it on my ipod .

1	i am so happy that i just discovered this song . i love it . i love this song and recommend it to everyone . it make me feel so good . i love this song and have recommended it to many people .
1	this cd is a great deal for the price . i love this album . i love that it is about a band who , at the time , i had never heard of , and i love that it is a tribute to their music . i also love that the song are short , and some of them are catchy , and some of them are not . the album is also filled with an array of great song , and i love the fact that the song are played in the order that they were written . which make sense , since the band is from the late 70 , and that is when this album wa written . the cd is well worth the price , and i will definitely buy the album from amazon.com again .
1	this is a great album . i love it . i have heard it and loved the lyric of it , but i have not really listened to it until recently . i really love mr. knopfler . i have the cassette version ; i just love the album . i have listened to it over and over and really enjoy it .
1	this one is really a nice song . it is slow and ha a good beat . it is nice to listen to when driving on the highway .
1	cabaret still shine well after decade . in her day , nobody could deliver like liza and cabaret illustrates why . you have to hear it again to understand .
1	i like them .
1	this is a compilation of david gilmores last few recording . this cd is not a complete disc . this cd and the one before it are basically a compilation of the best song he released over the last few year .
1	the dixie chick are a great band . they sound like they are playing on a stage . they are very good at playing the song . i really wish they would just play the song and not have a video to make it look like they are playing on a stage . the song are very over-produced . i wish the band would get back together and play this song in a venue . i will still listen to the album over and over again .
0	carrie underwood cd is a waste of time .
1	i love this album , but it is too low quality .
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful . every song clip horribly , especially demon . please release a better version .
1	i purchased this cd for my wife during christmas . she love jackie evancho and since she ha been playing it , i have also become a fan . miss evancho pose an incredible voice .
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation , this album is just a good or better . what ? ! if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica . if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass . when u2 decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked . that is what this is .
1	i really like this album . it is awesome ! i recommend it to anyone who love zaba .
0	came in distorted could not even hear it
0	i purchased the ringtone for my new motorola razr . i put it on my phone and it doe not work . i tried downloading it again and i tried it on my computer , and it doe not work .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
0	i am not a manowar fan . this album is bad .
0	i thought this wa going to be a good movie and i wa right .
1	this album wa one of the best album of 2010 .
1	this wa the best album i have ever heard from nirvana . the song are great , the production is great . i would buy this cd over any other nirvana album . i want to hear more of their music .
1	very good song , and the vocal are quite good .
1	i love hawaiian music . i used to own two hawaiian cd but never really liked them . this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach .
0	this song is very good . i think the vocal are very good . it is like a really good pop song . it is got great lyric , too . if you do not like christmas music , you just do not have to hear this song . the only thing that i do not like about this song is the sound quality . the song is very loud and it is very clear . i am trying to find a better copy of this song . i have heard some good version of this song , but i do not think any of them sound like they are really christmas music .
0	this cd rock . it rock like a t.j. & s
0	this , at first glance , may sound like nothing more than a typical holiday record . however , with a little extra effort , a new kind of music is created that is both fresh and unique .
1	i recommend this song to anyone who is looking for a song that help you cope with the problem of life . it make you believe in jesus .
0	this is a good choice to start the ballad trend . it is full of emotion and you can not help but feel it when you listen to this song . it is a great song and i can listen to it over an hour . i have had it on my list of favorite song and will continue to listen to it .
1	i just found out that mike shinoda wa a member of the
0	this is a nice song and the singer is great but the song is a little boring . i like the song but i did not like this album .
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song . the rest is , well , all filler . and the record is only half an hour long , so there are only about another five complete song ( track one is a reminder of maiden ` s number of the beast and track three is 50 second long ) . it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well . piece of advice , tape or download the single and spend your money on something else .
0	this is by far the best song on the album . i really like this song and the song is really good . the song is really good and the song is really catchy . the song is really good and the song is really catchy .
1	this song is good . i like the song and the album .
1	possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie . this soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie . nothing fancy . just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fit perfectly with the time period . a perfect example of how le can be far more effective .
0	i really like the song .
1	i love this song - it is the best rendition of the song i have ever heard . the only negative i can give it is that the original recording wa made from one of the two cd , so the song sound a little short , but it is still nice .
0	this one ha no power adapter .
0	i bought this cd and i love it . the song are good . i will purchase it again .

1	this song just made me think of my grandma . she wa a great singer . she sang at wedding and party . she wa in a choir . we used to have a lot of fun together . i miss her . this song just reminded me of her . i wish she would sing it again .
1	i wa really bored with a lot of the song on this album . the show must go on wa one of my favorite . i really really like this
1	this song made me cry
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation , this album is just a good or better . what ? ! if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica . if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass . when u2 decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked . that is what this is .
1	this cd is great .
0	i liked the song dancing to the music . it is a bit over a minute in length . the song is not very long . it is not too long . it is not too short , but it is not long . it is not too short . it is not short . it is not too long . it is not too long . it is not too long to listen to . it is a nice song . it is a good song . it is a good cd for a good price . it is a good cd for a good price . it is a good cd for a good price . it is a good cd . it is a good cd . it is a good cd for a good price . it is a good cd . it is a good cd . it is good . it is good . good . good . good . good . good . my favorite . my favorite . my favorite . my favorite . i like this song . i like this song . i like this song . good song . good song . good song . good song .
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
0	this cd doe not have christmas music . it ha christmas music and a little more . i do not know what else to say about this cd .
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd !
0	this is a very good album by a very bad man . the only song i really listen to is like a rolling stone . i also like like a rolling stone by the rolling stone . however , like a rolling stone is the only song i listen to over and over and over again . the rest of the album is very boring and i can never get through it without getting bored . not worth the money . this album is a waste of time .
1	i am not a big fan of music video .
1	i love the music on this album , i have listened to it about 100 time . it is an exceptional album that is hard to find . when you find it , listen to it . it is a great album . it is hard to believe this album is over 20 year old .
1	who can explain god love ? well , hallorin doe a great job . this song touch my soul and brings tear to my eye every time i listen to it . although we mess up , god clean u up and restores u . his love is not of this world . hallelujah !
0	i have been listening to this album for over a year now , and i still listen to it a often a i can . this album is just amazing . the song are just that good . some of the song have been played live , and some of the song have not .
0	i am a big fan of tegan and sara - they make me feel happy . i wa surprised to find that this is not their best album - i thought it would be more of a return to sound and style they were known for . but it is not - this album is just ok. i do not know if it is just their new producer or if there wa a lot of other thing going on behind the scene . it just doe not seem like a return to the sound they were known for . i can not say i like this album at all - it is not bad , mind you , but i do not think it is their best . they are probably better by this album - probably because they are more comfortable in their own skin and have learned to make a lot of personal decision . i am not sure what wa going on in the studio , but i like their new direction and i am glad tegan and sara are back .
0	what a horrible song to write about the awful deed you did . innocent child were involved ! the lyric are atrocious . i know that because i read them online . you can never understand a word this woman say .
1	i like how this song combine both element of the album , yet , is not overly over the top . it ha a little bit of everything and is not too over the top . the song is a very easy-going song . i would say that it is a song of love , although the love i see is more platonic love .
1	i like this song because it is a very positive song , and i think it will make you feel happy when you hear it . i like this song because it is a very catchy song and is very different from the other song i have been listening to .
1	this is a good version of this song . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . the drum are not needed .
0	: this song is a real gem , i have been listening to it all week .
0	not bad , but not what i wa really looking for . i will give it a listen .
0	this song should be called i do not give a damn , because it doe not matter what you do , you will always be left behind .
0	i liked this album . i did not like it a lot . i do not know . i just loved the cover art , the title track , and the i love you track . it wa one of the few album i have listened to that did not make me feel like i wa listening to crap . i did not like it . there are some great song on here . i do not know what else to say about it .

0	
0	this is the closest thing i have found to his version of a man up stair .
1	this is the best song on this album . i listened to a few other song and i have to say this song is the best so far . i just wish they would come out with a better album .
0	this album is a must for anyone who want to hear music that sound like the 70 and 80 .
1	i like this song !
0	good cd . i would say that it is better than most , but not a good a others like it is only right . the song are good but the lyric are not good . i think that lyric are the most important thing in music . not having lyric is like not having a good book .
0	i have been looking for a song like this that would let me know that i wa listening to something besides just the beatles . the song is very well done and ha a great beat . the singer ha a lovely voice and the song is fun to listen to and watch . i am happy that i purchased this song
0	i am a fan of this artist . i have loved her work since i first heard her song love you madly .
0	this is one of the best song that i have heard from this band . it is a mix of country and pop and i think it is the best .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
0	this is a good song , the last song on the album . sadly just a little short . not a bad song either .
0	i like this song a lot . it is really good . but the song ha a repetitive sound and it doe not have a good enough chorus .
0	this is good music , but i do not understand why the band want to put out a pop album . it not pop . it a hard rock album with a pop edge to it . i can not tell that i am listening to a pop band .
1	i wa pretty pleased with this song . i remember when it first came out it wa a hot seller . i am from the 80 and the song wa on the cd , but i listened to it on the cd and then i never bought the album . i do not think i bought the album , but i do recall listening to it on the cd .
0	this is lou reed first solo album . i have listened to some of this album myself . i have not listened to lou reed album that i have purchased . i listened to three or four song before purchasing the album . i do not know about other cd , but it is a good one . i would recommend it to others .
1	i love this cd . i had heard of this cd and decided to buy it , but i wa nervous because i have not heard this cd before . i wa very pleasantly surprised . the only thing that i do not like about this cd is the lonely man song . i do not like country music , so i am not used to the music this cd ha . i would recommend this cd to anyone . it is a very good cd . it ha a good feel to it . it is one of the best cd i have heard recently . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
1	i have been a fan of the grateful dead since i wa very little . i can not say enough good thing about the dead & their music .
1	this song is my favourite song . i like it a lot .
1	this is the only cd i have bought that is like a movie in my head . my mind is always going in one direction and i can not get it out of my head . i feel like i am watching a movie in my head and i do not know if i am watching the movie or if i am just dreaming . this album is awesome . i am having so much fun listening to this cd . i give this cd 5 star .
0	this is one of my favorite . i used to love listening to this song on the radio . i miss it so much . it wa a great song .
1	this album is a compilation of the very best song from over the top performer of the 90 and 2000s
1	i wa very pleased with all the service i got from amazon . the cd wa shipped quickly , arrived in good shape and wa packaged just a i wanted .
0	i think this is a great album .
1	all the song are good , but the only one i really like is the only one which is a really good song .
0	the cd is awesome !
1	this cd is a great collection of song . it contains all the song i have ever loved . i wa surprised with the cover . it is a very good cover of a song that i have always loved . i have listened to this cd over 100 time and it never get old .
0	this is one of the best song by air .
0	i think this is a good album , but not a good a i thought it would
0	it is an interesting album . it change a little bit with each song . it ha a little bit of a rock feel to it , but it ha a lot of different musical style to it . it is kind of like unbreakable only with a little more hip hop .
1	excellent . it is hard to think of a more important album in the history of rock and roll or any genre . it is the most important album of the 60 rock era . the first song is an electric blue , i want to go home . the rest are rock and roll , all of them stand on their own , with very different style . you should buy this album .
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
1	it is light hearted and happy . it fit in nicely a background for a slideshow i did .
0	this wa a good cd of music and i would give it five star . the two song on this cd that i did not like were when i am gone and i am so lonesome i could cry . i did not like when i am gone because it wa more of a ballad than a country song . i loved the i am so lonesome i could cry because it had a good tune and i thought the vocal were great . i also like the i think it is going to rain today a well a i am going , going , gone because the song were both good . overall , this is a good cd of music .
1	this song really rock !
1	i absolutely love this album . it is not on the same level a jewel other album , but she is still an amazing artist . the song are great , and the production is amazing . it almost sound like she wa in a studio with her own band .
1	i love the sound of this christmas song . it is very happy . i like the sound of the carol . i like the sound of the lyric . it make me feel happy . i like the sound of the carol . it is nice and easy on the ear .
1	we were a little late getting to this show , but we did manage to get to the show . we had a very nice time . it wa a lot of fun . we have a new friend in this band .
1	this is a great cd , even if you do not like blue . the music is quite unique and make me want to buy more .
0	while i am sure this album wa written by a group of talented musician , it is a very unoriginal song . i mean , there is not a lot here other than that one song . it is a waste to listen to . i would recommend this album only to people who are looking for something to listen to when they are bored .
0	i bought the entire album and i have to say i am not impressed at all . i bought the cd because of the review on amazon and the positive review . i wa hoping that the song that i loved would be included in this album . i do not know what to expect from this album . the only good song in this album is the first song and even then it is not great . i have to say i am disappointed .
1	this album is great . lou reed is a great artist . he
0	would not let me play the song .
1	great song is time of need when you need to lifted up . my soul do say yes to the creator of this universe . lord , i thank you and continue to bless brian wilson . this man can sing anything that is family oriented and church .
1	i have to say that i loved this cd . i bought it on the way home from the beach . the music is fantastic !
1	i agree with the other reviewer , this is a great , but hard rocking track that make my day .
0	this is the best live band i have ever heard and have been listening to for a long time now .
1	this is a very good album . i thought it would be a lot of thing like i want to die with my light on but it is not . it is a good album , and it is very different from other guetta album .
0	the worst of billy joel . he should stick to studio album and even retire . his voice is not holding up .
1	this song is soooo good . it is sooooooo good . i love this song
1	i like this song . it is a decent song .
1	this song is the only one on the album that i enjoy , and it is the only one that i can really listen to at all .
1	i can not stop thinking about you
0	i think the main problem i have with rihanna is that she ha completely lost touch with her root . she seems to have forgotten that it is not her voice that make her rihanna , but the music she sings and the lyric she writes . i think rihanna is a really good artist , and i do like her voice , but i do not think her music is of much interest to anyone , whether she is a pop star or not .
1	
0	i bought this album because i really liked the song my body . i really enjoyed the rest of the album , though . i like that it start off with a rap , and then segue into the song my body which is an actual rap song , and then it segue into stunner . it is a good album , but i think a lot of people have to give it a low rating .
0	i really like this song , but i am not sure if i will buy the whole album just for this one song .
0	i would like to buy this cd , but how would i find it ? it is not listed on amazon or other store .
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english .
1	this worship ( my season personally ) wa awesome .
1	this group is awesome and my daughter love it !
0	this is boring .
0	this sound like a really good song . it is a perfect song to sing along to .
1	i am a big fan of guetta and this music is like him . i really like the album ! i am glad i bought this album . i bought the vinyl . it is a good album ! i really like the instrumentals , the theme and lyric . i even liked the rap . it is a good album !
1	this is my favorite nirvana song . i like this song .
0	this song is about a girl who ha to be there for a girl , because she is not there for someone else . that is what the song is about . the guitar riff is so good i hope they play it in the movie version , the girl voice is so great , i hope they play it because it is so sad , i hope they play it because it is so great .
1	this is the song that ha been playing in the background of my car and in my truck for the past 3 month . i listen to it on the way to work every friday morning , and i feel a if a great weight ha been released from me .
1	this song just make me want to go out and buy another mouse album , i really like it .
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came out you think a track featuring garry shider , skeet curtis , and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier .
1	i love these song .
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard . it turn out that is the only good song on it . the rest of the cd is not anything i want to listen to . what else can i say ? steer clear .
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
0	i wa really disappointed by this album . i did not listen to it but i saw the review and they said it wa average . i like the song that are on there . i really do not like this album . the lyric are very generic and not very interesting , and the music is generic and doe not really stand out . i do not like how the song are put together . i do not know if this is a good or bad album but it is definitely not worth buying .
1	i really like this cd . it is a compilation of song written for soundtrack but it is all original music . it is not a lady cd , but i think it doe what i wa looking for . the song are all well done and all have a good beat . if you like a good beat with good music , you will probably like this cd .
1	i love this song ! i can not believe i had not heard it before . i will definitely check out more of his work .
1	i love this album . i can not stop listening to it . i love this album . i recommend it to any zaba fan ; i love this album !
1	this is an awesome release . it is more about how they recorded it rather than the performance itself . it is a pretty good listen .
1	my daughter love carrie underwood and ha all of her cd .
0	it pain me to see so many 1 star review coming from dylan own fan base . i have been a fan for over 40 year , and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered . bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now , but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time . this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated , but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place , and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate .
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
0	this is definitely not for my taste . very boring .
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i , m the biggest fun . once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed . very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth . i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin .
0	i love this album , it is hard to find a bad song on this album
0	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favorite album . it is not the best either . the guitar sound like a cheap guitar and the vocal are very tinny and tinier then i would like .
0	just me , i can not get into this . maybe it is the fact that i am not the target demographic , i am not into country music , or i am too old , or whatever , but i can not stand this album . it is so bad , i do not think i can say anything else except i hate it more than you do .
1	i have enjoyed the beatles
0	seriously another generic radio rock band that fall in the theory of a deaman my darkest day popevil buckcherry just straight up generic rock that sound like bon jovi meet nickelback that will be in roatation at rock station for the next 3 month then no one will remember who this band is seriously can we be a little more originally please !
0	this is one of my favorite song . it ha a good melody to it and a great chorus .
0	i have had a lot of bad experience with cd . but this album ha some good song . but the quality is terrible . i will probably order this album because i know i will like it .
0	i am a great believer in the power of music in changing someone life . i believe in the power of music in changing someone life .
0	it is just a preference . it is not my cup of tea that is all . too heavy going for young child i think .
1	i have been looking for a new band to love and this is it . i am so glad that i found this band . this is such a great band and i am so glad that i finally found them . this is an excellent , excellent album , everything on this album is great . you should listen to it .
1	i had been in the habit of buying lp for a few year . however , i never bought a cd until i went to see ringo starr at the u.s. open and saw the beatles on stage : here come the sun . i bought the cd immediately . i listened to it on the way home and decided to order more . it ha been my constant companion for the last 4 month . i do not think i could be without it .
0	very nice compilation . the song are varied and the performance are good .
1	my favorite version . it ha a nice melody and good harmony .
1	i like that the guitar is in background rather than out front , but it is still a good song . i do not know why , but i like this song a lot .
0	i can not say i agree with your 1 star rating of this cd . i think it is a fine cd . i give it a 3 star rating just because of the price . but it is a good cd . i would not even buy it unless i had to , because i am afraid that even with the price tag , there would be no way i could afford it . i think a 3 star rating would be more appropriate , though .
1	this is a great song !
0	where is the banjo ? where is the awesome make me live music ? there is not one song on this album that compare to anything or any one song you have done in the past . whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong . do what you love , not what other people want . this is definitely not what i expected . i just got this today , on your release day and could not skip through it fast enough . very disappointed .
0	i enjoy music that clearly tell a story ; the tone is moving and very enjoyable . what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung . hopefully artist in the future could follow example ; where music could be music again .
0	this album is a complete waste of time - i should have waited for the next album .
1	the best song on the album that is worth it money . this is the best song on the album , and it is a song you will be talking about for year to come . the song ha a great chorus , and the whole song is so catchy .
1	this is a classic . i love the way they play the guitar and the way the piano add to the sound of this song .
0	this record is the epitome of mediocrity . lou reed is a gifted musician and this is the album that the world need . the song are fantastic , but lou reed is not a great singer and the lyric are boring and uninteresting . it is a shame that this album doe not have the same quality that a good album would have .
1	this song is a great addition to this album . i really like the song who is gon na buy my baby .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song .
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .
1	i love this album . i really like the song on this album and i think that it is really good and worth getting . this is my favorite album because i think that it is really good and i really like the song on it .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	this is an amazing worship song ! it is so great !
1	this is a great album . i love this song .
0	horrible . i only bought it because the ex-girlfriend wanted it . i wish there wa a no star rating .
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him . if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you !
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist . mr. grey had a great voice , this song ha a happy/upbeat tempo and it serf a a kinda thank you for all the song that follow : give me the beat boy ! just writing this review i need to listen to this again .
0	this is a great song and would not mind having it in my collection . this is one song that i have always wanted to listen to with my wife .
0	i only heard 1 song off the album but sometimes i wait i do not want something i cant give back , i like to give but i do not want to give back better save your money , i heard a song i did not like , i only heard 1 song off the album , better save your money
0	i love this collection . the musicianship is great .
1	the lyric on this album are very good . they are very well sung . i like the lyric . the music is very good . the vocal effect are very good .
1	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed . i like that they have a banjo , but i did not expect to listen to this song for a long time . i am glad i did , because i am really glad i listened to it . it wa interesting to me , and i love that the song is about the joy of sharing music with a friend , and the joy of having fun . it wa interesting to me , and i love that the song wa about the joy of sharing music with a friend , and the joy of enjoying the company of a friend . it reminded me of a song that i really like , but i did not expect to enjoy for a long time . it reminded me of a song that i really like , but did not expect to enjoy for a long time . it reminded me that the song that i really like are just a wonderful when i am listening to them for the first time a they are after a long time .
0	this is a really great song but i think every song need a chorus . this is a great chorus and i like the song overall . the song is really slow and not very energetic . i liked it overall but it did get boring .
1	this album is really good . i love the song on this album and i enjoy the band song .
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied .
1	i really like this song . the song ha a good sound to it and it sound like it could be a hit or a dance song . the lyric , however , are a little off because they are a little too generic . i am not a huge fan of rap , but this song is good anyway . it is a good representation of the song genre so i am not complaining one bit about this . the only thing that i do not like about the song is the fact that the song is very repetitive .
1	the best cd of her career
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day . i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music . first off , her voice is absolutely amazing . some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million . most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range . she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album .
0	i love this album . the song are good , the lyric are good , and the band is great . i recommend this album . i am a fan of this band and i will purchase it again .
1	excellent ! i would recommend it to anyone who love to sing .
1	this is one of the best cover i have ever heard . the song is so true to the original song .
0	the first and only album i have not liked from floyd since final cut
1	i really really really liked this album . i think it really good .
0	i gave this a listen . a friend of mine know i am a big fan of frank , etc , so he thought i would like this . but , like so many young guy out there trying to sing like sinatra ( i am looking at you , mike buble ! ) , they fail because they have no heart . now , technically , seth is a good singer . i do not particularly care for his singing voice , but obviously he is got some talent there . i almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover . i would like it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover .
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
1	i really love this album . i am a big van morrison fan and this is one of my favorite music album . i just do not like this album . it is just like he is writing a song and then just repeat it . i could really care le about the lyric on this album , but i do like the music . i do not like this music . it is just like he is writing a song and just repeat it . i could not be happier that i found this album . i am a big van morrison fan and all
1	a collection in the style of your work . i have enjoyed them all .
1	
1	i bought the beatles first album . i bought all of their record . this album is the best by far . i think it is a great album to start off with . the only beatles album that i can listen to now is rubber soul , but the lyric are a bit on the lame side . this album is my favorite .
0	still a glorious voice . but the arrangement suck . too lounge-y . only a piano when some of these require lush arrangement .
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike ( and try to avoid ) about hollywood production . terrible .
1	i love the song . the lyric are great . the music is great too .
0	the most popular guy in the world , i guess . i know there are several singer similar to him , but he ha a very distinct sound . you can tell he wa a great singer . but , this album is just so bland and uninspired . i would rather listen to prince lovesexy than this . i can not really understand why people like this singer . i mean , he is not even half the singer prince wa . this is a joke . i could not wait for the dvd and the dvd wa a waste of time . i wish sony would have just released this a a single cd . i would have bought it and left it alone .
1	this is the first stryper cd that i have bought . the only problem is that the cd came out of the same factory that made the other record , so i do not know if it will play on my car radio .
1	why do not we see this chick on tv ? i have heard her only occasionally on the radio , and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental . so well-done that she should be way on top !
0	this is a fantastic album that i highly recommend to all . i would not put it up against any of the other album on here . the production is great and the vocal are lovely . i have listened to this album on and off over the past few month and i still love it . i think it is worth the money i paid for it .

0	i heard this song in my church and the band wa great . it wa soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version .
1	this song is great . it is a great song and it ha a great beat . i really like this song .
1	i really like this album , and i like the violin and viola solo . i like the cello solo . i love the singing in this album too . i really like the violin . beautiful . i think this is the best classical music i have heard in a while .
1	i really like this album ! it is good .
0	i thought the book wa censored . this book is graphic and thus it show a sex scene that is censored and not shown in the film the devil wear prabad .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
1	this is my favorite album of all time . it ha the best songs/lyrics of any alex clare album . i am glad i paid the money .
0	
0	this is a bad album . the band , and the songwriter , are not well known . i am not talking about manowar . this album is just bad . i can not recommend it to anyone . the only good song is you are no good , but it doe not sound like manowar .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
1	a great song . it is a great song . you can tell by the way it sound like it is about to burst into flame .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable .
1	this album made me want to buy some more adam lambert album . i
1	i have been an avid fan of chicago since i wa a teenager . i am an old soul and have grown up with chicago music since the 80 . i have always liked chicago music . i love their sound , their lyric and their message . i am a fan of song like the great pretender , which i believe wa written about a woman who wa a great pretender . i also like can i get a witness and the way we were . i think this song is a very good choice for the holiday season .
1	great vocal with some great lyric .
0	i think this album is very good . i think this album is very good .
0	he is very talented , and the album is worth the listen . some song are very good , the rest are a little too much over the top .
1	great song ! i would recommend this song to any of my friend who are suffering from insomnia . i think i would like to listen to it all the time .
0	my son love this album . the song are good . i liked it .
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that . it get lower star rating because it is censored . the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this . when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [ explicit ] but one that is clean ha nothing like [ censored ] or [ clean ] next to it . jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it .
1	this wa an amazing tribute to frank sinatra sung by some very talented people . this wa the perfect tribute to frank sinatra . the arrangement and writing wa great and i loved the way the song wa performed . i truly appreciate all the singer for this song . i truly had a great time and i loved it . thanks .
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
1	i fall asleep to this every night before i go to bed .
1	she is a good singer and a nice girl .
0	the trail hear did not sound like a mix- i do not like downloading any mixes- i like original music- these were all for my prom birthday party in november . still will play the tune but not what i originally wanted .
1	excellent work of art . she is on target with every song . seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative , bad girl image . some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question , this is a top quality production .
1	this song is great . i love it .
1	this is a great song . i really enjoy the sound of it . it just ha that kind of beat . great song . awesome .
0	wow . i wa hoping for more like his first 2 album and wa severely disappointed . nirvana . really ? not great listening .
0	i have been listening to this album for a while now , and i truly believe that it is something that i will be able to listen to for a very long time . i love the music , and i really like this album .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this album is good but it could be better with a little more variety - and a better sound .
0	this title is mangled - disco beat , sputtering word that are incomprehesible , then dead silence .
0	i am not a fan . it is a nice song , but i am not sure that i would like to hear it on the radio . i would be more likely to skip , but i also think that i would like to hear it .
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him . if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you !
0	i own the e- street band cd . i am a fan of bruce springsteen and e street band . i have been a fan of bruce springsteen since the early to mid 1980s . i started with the e-street-band cd and have purchased 3 more cd from them since . this is not for the e-street-band fan .
0	the only reason for me to buy this product is to give my friend another copy .
1	this album is fantastic . i love the music and the lyric . i really love this record .
1	christina and blake sound wonderful together ! who would have guessed it . : )
0	the album is very different from the other two , but i love it ! it is my favorite of the three . it is a very different album than the other two , yet i am still on board . i guess it is because i love the new song so much more . i thought , i could hate this album , but i love it . this album , i love .
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it .
1	this is my favorite chris tomlin song . i love this song and i love chris tomlin . i love the lyric and the music . this is one of chris tomlins best song .
1	i love the god bless the child song . i found it on amazon.com at a very good price and wa glad to find it there . it wa listed under other music and not under joe augustine . i wa very happy to find this album .
0	it is a sound track for the movie not the
1	this is a great album . if you like alternative rock , you should buy this album . i have bought this album a few time and i am always happy when i order it . it is a great album . it is just well-written and the lyric are really funny .
1	i have been listening to this since i found it on amazon and i really enjoy it . it is a great collection .
1	i am a huge fan of ani williams and i wa really excited to see the new album , the best of ani williams coming out . i wa kind of expecting a lot of the same stuff i already heard when i wa a kid . i wa pleasantly surprised . the song are very good and i do not really have a bad or good thing to say about this album . i think that the lyric are very well done and i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of ani williams music .
0	i have been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year , but wa not thrilled with this at all . the music wa boring and not a exciting a his brief singing spot on buffy . i would pas on this one .
0	just bought this cd . i do not know why someone would put this cd into their christmas cd . the song are all right , but the sound quality is very poor . there is no stereo channel to choose from , so it is impossible to hear the lyric or to hear a different vocalist .
1	i listen to the mp3s for enjoyment but also for training purpose on the guitar . so it go without saying that quality is paramount .
0	
0	terrible sound quality ! i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the song because it wa so warped . dont buy the vinyl version . even worse , i missed the return date . i am stuck with it .
1	janet is a great singer and this is a great rendition of the old classic .
0	when i first played this cd , i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez . then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following : all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group . not sure what this is supposed to mean , but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to . do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else .
0	i really like the way the lyric are sung and the way the people are singing them . i like that people are singing them to a loved one .
0	it wa a gift , i love these song .
1	adam second full-length release . i think i prefer his first album and his voice is even more powerful than it wa on his previous album . the song are very well written with solid melody and are very well produced . i think the album couldve used a little more attention to detail in the production or perhaps adam should have chosen to put his own spin on it . i am curious about the name american idol when compared to his more pop-oriented material .
1	you are my sunshine is a song by the beach boy . it wa written by brian wilson and mike love . it wa released on the beach boy debut album , surfin u.s.a .
1	it sound great and the price wa right
0	this song may be the worst song on the album a a whole , but it is not my worst song by a long shot . it is not bad , but it is not the best .
0	i am not sure where i found this at in the store . i ordered it a a gift for my boyfriend , who i really like and he is not the greatest singer . he is great at singing , but not great at writing , so i am not sure he is going to be happy with this . it is just a bit of his favorite song , and i really like it . maybe i will put it on the computer , but it is so hard to get the right key . i am going to listen to this , maybe itll be okay .
1	i love how you can take the cd on the road .
0	this is just filler that is made in a cheap way . it is not even worth playing . i think they should make money by making better song like a thousand year with a nice chorus instead of just making i will survive one . i wa looking for music to put on my ipod and this wa the best one i could find .
0	this is a terrible product . it is not a good song , it is like the sound is from a tape deck or something . very poor quality recording sound . the record wa awful .
0	i wa introduced to this album through a recommendation from a friend . i wa not expecting to like it but i wa pretty surprised . it is a great album and i like the way the song are constructed , the way that they are sung , and the manner in which the song are presented . i really like this album . i will definitely be buying it .
1	this is my favorite album volbeat ha ever made .
1	it really ha the power to get you to sleep . i listen to it every night before i go to bed .
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike ( and try to avoid ) about hollywood production . terrible .
0	i love the music of this band . i have several of their album and have listened to them many time . this time , however , i listened to it on a rather large cassette tape , and it wa not nearly a good . i have also heard the song in their entirety on the radio , and they are all exceptional .
1	this song will make you sing along . the lyric are great and the song itself is a good representation of the original . it ha a nice melody and a
0	i like that the guitar is in the background rather than out front , but it is still a good song .
0	a nice rendition of the traditional .
0	this band is a very good band . their music is really good . they should continue to do all the great thing they do .
1	this is an awesome album ! the quality of the song is great . i love all the song and cover version .
1	i am sure many of you have heard of him . he is one of the best of all-time . i did not know he wa so famous in other country , but i wa surprised when he wa able to get his work out and made it out there . i am a musician myself , but just when i thought i did not like music , i found out there were other people who really liked it . i guess i am just a big fan . i am sure many of you have heard of him . he wa one of the most influential r & b/hip hop artist of all time with his song and the song he wrote . i am sure most of you have heard of him . he is one of the most influential r & b/hip hop artist of ever , with his song and the song he wrote . i am sure most you have heard of him . he wa one of the most influential , especially on hip hop , with his song . he wa one of the most influential , especially on hip hop and r & b , with his song . he is a great singer and a great performer . i am sure many of you have heard of him . the song are different from what you hear on the radio , yet they are a good or better . the song are different from what you hear on the radio , but they are a good or better . he is got everything . he is got everything you would expect from an artist like him , but he is added his own flavor to it . he is got everything you would expect from an artist like him . he is got everything you would expect from an artist like him but he is added his own flavor to it . he is got a voice that can go from a quiet whisper to a loud shout . he is got a voice that can go from a quiet whisper or a loud shout . he is got a voice that can go from soft to loud . he is got a voice that can go from soft to loud , but not too loud . he is got a voice that can go from soft to louder , but it is not too loud . he is got a voice that can go from a whisper to loud and back again , but he is not too loud . he is got a voice that go from a whisper to loud and back again but not too loud . he is got a voice that go from soft to loud , but not too loud . he is got just the right amount , but he is not too loud . he is got just the right amount , but it is not too loud . he is got just the right amount , and it is not too loud . he is got just the right amount of power in his voice , but he is not too loud . he is got just the right amount of the right amount of power in his voice , but he is not too much , but it is not too loud . he is got just the right amount of power in his voice , but it is not too loud . he is got just the kind of voice that go from a whisper to a shout . he is got just the kind of voice that go from a soft whisper to a loud shout . he is
0	i bought the cranberry song because i like their music . i bought it because of the cover . i like the song because it ha a good beat . i like the band because they are good . i bought it because i like the group . i like the band because i like the fact that they have a good sound .
1	i would like to thank you for this song . i like the lyric , but the song is not good at all .
1	i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year . i bought this album because i needed a quick fix to get me through the holiday season . i loved this album and the music is very eclectic . i believe this is the best album joe augustine ha recorded .
1	this is definitely the best rap album of all time . i love the fact that it got all of his best verse .
0	not what i wa looking for- i wanted a reading of the sanskrit , the word for word definition and the translation . the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature , so the 3 star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking . also , i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires . the sanskrit mantra , when they are present and accurately read , are music enough .
0	slipknot is a band that is for the most part just cool . i can not say i really like them , but they are cool .
0	i have heard that this is the best album by this band . the song are great . the lyric are good . i will buy it .
0	listening to this cd , all the way through , wa neither easy nor enjoyable . if you like beat-driven pop with repetitious lyrical hook , you might like 0304. if you are expecting to be touched by another excellent jewel collection , prepare to have your heart broken . this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who ha heard it . it is pure pop drivel .
1	you guy are awesome ! this song , and i am so glad to see glee brought it back . it wa fun !
0	this is a good song which i have heard before , but it is not a good song . it very generic sounding and ha no discernible meaning . i think it ha a song for every occasion . i am not a fan .
1	i just love this song . it is so inspiring !
1	i love what i hear from robin thicke . he ha a new single out , and it is pretty good . i think it is the best song i have heard in a long time . the guitar solo is also really good . he is a great vocalist . he can sing a tune , and he can sing it really good . i really like his voice . i do not know how he doe it , but he can sing a song really good . the song is great , but i have a couple of problem with it . 1 ) the song is too long . 2 ) the song is a bit too slow . 3 ) the song ha some lyric . 4 ) the song is not a real song . i know what the song is about ,
1	i do not know if i can really say much more than that . i like hearing what these guy are doing and it keep me interested . you can tell they have a good sense of humor and they have fun doing what they are doing . it is not a particularly inspiring album , but it is nice to listen to while listening to the news .
0	a very cool song , this is my favorite .
1	the album is excellent and very well produced . this is a great album to add to your own collection .
0	this song is not that good . this song is just boring . i do not know what the title of this song is . i do not know how i would write about it . i do not know what this song is about . i do not get it . i do not understand it . i do not really like this song . i do not know what the song is about . i do not like it . i do not know what this song is about . i donve got the lyric to this song . i do not like it . i do not know what this song about . i do not know what the title of this song is . i like this song . i do not know what this song about . i do not get it . i do not understand it .
0	this wa a nice compilation album , with a lot of music from the period . the song are all r & b and blue , and although the cd is not a good a some of the others , at least it is a nice compilation of music from the period . the song spin is my favorite on the cd , although i am not sure if the cd is worth buying .
1	they keep getting better and better , every song is talking directly to me ! your side of the bed , listen to the word - amazing !

0	i have been trying for year to find this song . i have downloaded the mp3 and i have tried to play it , but it never play ! i have tried all the different ring tone on my phone , but nothing will play . i have tried to download the song and put it on my ipod , but i can not find it . i would really like to have this song , but i can not find it . i have tried on my computer , but it doe not work either . i have tried different email account , but no luck . can someone please help ?
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .
0	i have been listening to this album for a while and i think it is great . it is a great song , but it is not really a great song . it is a good album and if you like their first album this is a great album . if you do not like their first album this is a great album .

1	i am a huge fan of this band and i love their music . this song is just awesome . it is fun to listen to and it great to dance
1	i am not sure if i have heard this new album by another band or not . i do not know what to think about it . that would be the only reason i bought it .
0	this album is a good blue album . i think it is worth the price . i do not think you are getting a great album . instead , you get a boring album . the production is good . the song are easy on the ear . the guitar and bass sound are good . the song writing is good . the lyric are good . but , in the end , i think you get a boring album . i think you should get a better album . i think this is a great album . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a great sounding album .
1	i have no idea what this is for . it sound like a cd to me . i am a fan of her but i do not know her music . i just know that she is the best . true i have a friend who is in a band who i listen to and he is a big fan of her so i think this may be about him .
0	i bought this album because the song praise the sun wa featured on the tv program the price is right . i wanted to use it but it wa too long . i bought this album instead . it is a nice little album . but the song praise the sun is very very slow and it is way too long .

1	i had heard a few of these song when i wa in high school and i wa amazed they could pull this off . i am really happy i bought this cd . i have grown to love this band . i can not believe they released this cd . this cd is so good . i wa disappointed in the cd-ripping . i can not understand how you can rip a cd , edit it , then rip it again , and still sound the same . this cd is definitely a keeper . i give this cd 5 star . it rock .
0	i am a vocal man , so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music , why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean , during my era of music it wa pretty simple . journey . lovin , touchin , squeezin , pretty simple huh . def leppard . pour some sugar on me , no college class to figure out what any of those song were about !
1	this song is fantastic .
0	this would be a great performance only if the song wa close to the original . it is just very close . it doe not stand out , but it is good . it is a good performance .
1	this wa an improvement over the previous album and it still ha not improved on the previous one . it is still good . i have liked this album . i think it is good , i will buy it .
0	there are quite a few song on this album that are very , very good . the song vary from good to good to really , really good . the guitar playing is very , very good . there are some very good song on here . the song also have a good vibe . all the song range from good to good to really , really good .

1	these song are great . i would of bought them . i love the song . i will tell you what , i love the singer . i really like the song .
0	this song is fun and happy . it is like being in a rockin good time . it ha a great beat and catchy lyric .
0	what i simply and always say , is that when a artist ha to come out with a song , they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice . for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r & b voice and sound in her music , it actually ha not actually drove the point home . her song without me , with kelly roland and missy elliot , the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song .
1	a a tribute to paul taylor passing , i think this compilation is a good idea . the cd is well put together and the song are very well arranged . nice selection of artist to listen to a well .
1	this is great . a great song !
0	this album wa a complete mess . the song had no substance . it wa boring , and i felt like i wa listening to a very bad song by some obscure band that had done a few cover for their own amusement . i do not care if it is sinatra , i would rather listen to some of his good old time rocker .
1	i have a collection of a few hundred song all of which have been on my playlist for a long time . this album is in my top three . i have seen this album reviewed on many different music site . the only thing that i can say is that if you like the music then you will like the album
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
1	i really like the new version . it is different . i really like the old version , it is a different sound . it is a different look . i really like the old look . it is a
0	i hate it .
0	if you like betty boop and fancy the idea of her singing soft ballad you will love this stuff . me . not so much .
0	i have read the book on amazon and it wa very graphic . the book is censored and thus the book can never be a full book since it is censored . i would recommend the book to other people but i am going to take the negative for the book .
1	this is a great album . i love the song in this album . i think tom skiba is a really great musician . i hope you enjoy this album .
1	al stewart did some good work , only a few song had airplay . peter white wa the guitarist . a must for any 70s-80s playlist .
1	this song is a really interesting one . i wa surprised to see that the original recording only had the first two chord , and that the guitar playing wa so good .
0	if you are a fan of christinas work , a well a the band , this is worth checking out . the original version ha great energy , and is a more stripped down version than the one i am currently playing .
1	i love all the song in this cd .
0	i love this album . it is a masterpiece . it is a great album . it is a very good album . this is the best album that i have ever heard . i think this album ha a lot of good thing in it . it is a very good album .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case .
0	this wa my first time purchasing a digital download from amazon . i have purchased several other item from amazon , but this is the first time i have purchased anything from this site . i have purchased a few other item from amazon , but for the most part , i am only interested in the best of the best . i wa surprised that this wa the best of the best . the song is not of the highest quality . it is extremely low-end . i wa hoping to find the best of the best , but not this . what you get is a song that sound low-end and is the same song over and over again . the sound quality is terrible . i would have returned it , but i wa hoping that i would be able to return it with no issue . i am disappointed , and will not buy another item from amazon .
1	i really enjoy this album . i love the song i have heard so far . i like the different style of music on this album . love it !
1	- the song is a little repetitive , but it contains great music .

1	love song is a very good song . the singer is a very talented singer . his voice is very unique and rich . the guitar player , chris stuckey , is a talented young man and is the driving force behind the band . the rhythm section is very good a well and they are a very entertaining band . their style is very energetic and they have a very good sense of humor .
0	this album is not bad . i like the song and the vocal . the album is not really a bad album .
0	this really make me feel better .
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho . it is one of my favorite of all time , so you can imagine how delighted i wa to see this release wa available . i bought it a soon a i saw it and wa excited when it showed up on my doorstep . i put it on my turntable and wa horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality wa . it wa like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs . i could not believe how dreadful it sounded .
0	some good instrumentals , but overall the album is very generic . the vocal are okay , but nothing special . i will give it a few listens , but it doe not stick out a a stand out album . i am not sure how to classify it , but it seems like a generic hip hop album , not a good one .

0	they chopped the song off ! the original song is 4:30. the edited song , which appears here , wa chopped off at around 3:33. huge disappointment . and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing .
1	the cd is very well produced , with strong songwriting on most of the track . i have not heard any other jonathon track that are not worth buying .
0	this is an excellent album . they have been very busy over the last few year with their other band , but jewel never seem to be on a break . i like the cd for it music , not for the lyric .
1	while his first album may be better , his second is a step in the right direction . the first album had very good song , but it fell far short of his more pop-oriented material .
0	i have heard them many time with great result . i have also seen them live many time . this album is definately not the best o.a.r . album but it is definately one of their best album . this is definately one of the most important album to ever come out . i have seen them many time and i have been a fan of o.a.r . for many year . this is definately a must have album for any o.a.r . fan .

0	this cd ha a great sound quality , but i could not care le about the music . the song are good , but the entire album is just not worth the money .
0	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i bought this album because i had been waiting for the new pink floyd album . i have been a fan of pink floyd since the beginning . i love this album .
1	this is the best version of the original . it is beautiful .

0	just a really nice cd .
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 day both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of the previous album . ( i liked god of war ) this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy .
1	beautiful , meaningful song ! god speaks through this song and encourages those who listen .
1	this is one of those album where you can not help but sing along with everything on it . this album ha it all . great song , great lyric , great production , and a great musical score . a must for any lover of music . - diggity lizard
0	i do not really like this song . but the lyric are funny . i like the video , and i like the song . it is just not for me .
1	this song ha a very upbeat and cheerful feel to it . it is a song where you can tell there is a lot of good energy in the song .
0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .
0	i like the beat & the tune , but could do without the lyric . where al word crime ha similar beat & tune but happier , fun lyric .
1	this wa a wonderful show . the song is very good , and the singing of the lady is very good . i have never heard of this show before , and i am glad that i found it . i give it a 4/5 .
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest . still a timely cd . came on time and in a bubble envelope . worth a purchase for sure .
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube . when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system . after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production . hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice , but that wasnt allowed to come through . the second song , edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background . the piano virtually drowned out her voice .
1	a song that will be played in the car , or on your way to work , or on your way to school . the lyric are very good . the music is good . the music video of the song is very good . there are many different sound of the song , and it is funny how it change . the song will make you laugh and is very good for the person that is in a good mood . this song is always played at the end of a party . it is good for the people who like to dance , and it is good for the people who like to have a good time . it is always played in a club , but it can be played at any party . this song is good for the person who like to party . it is good for the people who like to have a good time .
1	i have been listening to this for quite some time now . the song are great and the vocal are great . there are a few song that i do not like ( i do not like i will be home for christmas and sleigh ride , but most of the song i like ) and a few song that i like ( i like christmas time and i have been lonely for ) . i would recommend this to anyone and everyone .
0	this album is a pleasant listen .
0	this is the first of two ccarry me back song , the second being back again , which would eventually end up on the next cd . i am a fan of the carry me back song but not the back again song . i thought the song had more of a rock/pop feeling with a slower tempo , but the second song wa just a good , if not better than the first one . the second song ha a slower tempo , but ha a great chorus and a little rock n roll feel to it .
1	i have never purchased music from amazon before , however the review on this album were excellent . this is a very good album .
0	i really like this cd .
1	i bought this cd to listen to on the computer . the sound quality is great and i can listen to it anywhere for hour on end .
0	this album is not bad at all . i really enjoyed this album and it ha a really good beat .
1	i can not wait for it to come out ! this song is one you will never forget !
0	! a real piece of crap , this is the worst cd i have ever heard and i have heard many . and i got a lot of cd like this .
0	i am sorry , but i simply can not take in the fact that i am listening to this . i need a good drink .
0	i think it is a very good album . i have enjoyed it many time . i have always loved bob dylan song . i have listened to this album a number of time . it is a good collection of song you can play in car . i agree with the other reviewer . it is a good album .
0	this is a good song and not a bad song . i actually like this song more than the cover . the cover really doe not fit the song . also , i am not sure why a group that ha been around for 35 year would decide to record a song with a singer that ha not sung for 35 year .
0	i have listened to this album a few time now and i still really like it . the song on the album are great , but i do not think i would listen to it again .
0	i hope people stop buying this album . it wa so bad .
0	not the best stuff from either artist
1	this time , i saw it in 3d . i am not a big fan of 3d , but this wa a very good movie . i really enjoyed it . it wa a great story . i really enjoyed it . i felt really sad at the end . i feel like it wa a very good movie , and i liked it . i liked it , and i think it is better than the last one .
1	i think it the best cd i have ever heard . the riff are nice and the vocal are cool .
1	this is a very good song . i like the fact that it us the song baby it is cold outside and the music video a the lyric . i like the song because it is a very catchy song .
0	this is my favorite track on the album , and it wa my favorite track on the album when it first came out .
1	beautiful , meaningful song ! god speaks through this song and encourages those who listen .
1	i love this record . i have been looking for a long time for a new dj shadow album . it is so refreshing to hear him break out from the trap/bass heavy rap/house music he doe . he is one of the few artist out there who doe not sound like every other rapper or artist . he creates his own sound , and is not just another rapper who put out a bunch of bad beat . this is a great album .
0	lifehouse is a band from germany , and all of their song are performed in german .
0	i do not like this song . it is not a great song . it is not a good song . it is not a bad song , it is just not a great song . i would call it a 1 star review because it is not a great song .
0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago . delayed a my review may be it is sincere . i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best band of the bosstown rock scene . i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track . i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record .
0	this album is great . i love the sound of the guitar , but the lyric are very uninteresting . i would have given it a five if there wa more original song .
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about 3 year now , and now that it is finally out . the anticipation is deffinatly worth it . i love this cd , it is just a amazing a i had expected . it is awsome . it is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to . it is a combinaiton or hip hop , and metal . it is an awsome combination . it is funny , adn serious . so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it . i think that this cd ha just made my month .
1	the music wa great on this album . i also bought it for my son to listen to while he wa in college . he is a fan of all kind of music and he really enjoyed this album .
1	another one my mom got to enjoy for awhile before it wa passed back to me because mom and she ha now gone home herself yo heaven
0	i wa completely unaware of this album , but i have recently become a huge zappa fan . when this album came out , it wa a major surprise to me . i wa completely amazed and blown away when i listened to it . it is a very good album , and very well-crafted . the first time i heard this album , i wa a bit disappointed , but a i listened more and more , i wa amazed with all the song and how well they were put together . the cover art is also very well done .
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
0	my mother and i absolutely love josh groban and this song . but we were very disappointed when it only played the first verse and the chorus like five more time . very disappointing rendition
0	a really good song , but i do not think i will be listening to this one again .
0	i have listened to this album over and over . it ha a very soothing sound to it . i wish that there wa more of an emphasis on the lyric and le on the music . i am very disappointed in the overall sound of the album , but still highly recommend it .
0	well i see now it doe say this is a cd . but i am so dissatisfied . i thought richard would be stretching with me . he is not at all . i went to his website to let them know how upset i am the email came back undeliverable .
0	i do not know . it is hard to tell , but i have a feeling this song is not so bad .
1	this song rock ! i love the melody and the lyric .
0	i wa born in the 90 , so i do not know whether i would have enjoyed this album . but if you ask me , i would say that i would have enjoyed this album . i can not imagine why anyone would not like this album .
1	nice album , easy to listen to , and obviously a hit for ms. morissette . would not doubt that because of the sound , lyric and time this album wa released , itll easily be noted a a
1	bonnie tyler voice is not like anyone el . it is a unique and pure tone with an emotion that is hard to put your finger on . one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard . she sings in harmony with a choir , and it make you feel like you are in a movie . you can almost hear the actor in the movie and feel the emotion through the music . i would like to see a film based on this song .
1	this disc is very good . it is a very nice collection of acoustic blues/rock/jazz that have . it is very good and a great addition to one collection . however , there are some flaw that are not so serious . it is a nice collection . however , there are a couple of flaw that are not so serious .
1	! , one of the best song from the year .
1	this album is great .
0	
1	the cd ha a number of song that will make you want to listen to them over and over again . the song are all very different and with a lot of different sounding instrument . the vocal harmony and melody are all very interesting . there are a lot of different type of song , and every now and again you find a song that is really good . my favorite is the in the back of the barn song . it is a country song , and one of the best country song i have ever heard .
0	nice track . a nice break from the more typical celtic frost music . a nice change from the heavier , more aggressive celtic frost . i wish there had been more in this release . i think there should have been more track with more ambient/instrumental element and more vocal , but that is just me .
1	i love it . i just purchased this album and i am still listening to it . it is one of my favorite album this year .
1	? ! ? what can i say ? it is a great cover of a great song .
0	a great cd .
0	while the arrangement of this cover get 5 star , this performance of it get 1 ( it would get 0 if that were an option ) . if you want to hear the original cover , which wa done while giving proper credit where it wa due , check out jonathan coulton ! also , purchase the one that is in the style of glee so that the purchase go to a good cause . < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/baby-got-back-in-the-style-of-glee/dp/b00b6lrx34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?
0	i think 0304 is the worst album ever made .
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
1	i wa really looking forward to this album . i like the song on it , and i think that she is still the same person . she is definitely no sl
0	this song is great ! if you do not like long song you should listen to this one .
1	this is a great cd . it ha all the thing that i like in a cd . it ha all the thing that i like in a cd , but this cd is a great mix of music . this cd is a great mix of music . it is a very good mix . this cd is a very good mix of music . it ha great variety . this cd is a very good mix of music . it is a very good mixture of music . this cd is a very good mix of music . this cd is a very good mix .
0	it is a decent song . i do not like the way the singer sings it .
1	i bought this album so that i could listen to some of the material that wayne had made before he passed away . this is a wonderful album that i think all fan of wayne should have .
1	this is so good ! this is one of my favorite worship song .
0	i agree with the other review . it is just repetitive and boring .
0	i agree , this song is a little off key , but when it is played back to me at the right speed , it is beautiful . i have this song on repeat for the next 20-30 minute . i like the part where she say we are not done yet . i have heard this song a few time and still get a little emotional when i hear it .

1	! this is great !
0	after listening to the album for the first time i wa somewhat dissapointed . i wasnt blown away by the music . i wa dissapointed i could not find the donny osmond version of this album . this album wa a little disappointing . i do have other album besides this one . i bought it in the mail and i will try to listen to it in another format . i have the original cd of this album . i also have the cd of the movie . i would buy it again . it is the best cd i have ever bought . i am glad i bought it . this is a great album .
1	this album is absolutely amazing . great song , great musicianship , great lyric . this album is a great album to listen to during a stressful day . it really help me to relax and not worry about the stress i am feeling . i look forward to listening to the new album . i hope they release an expanded edition .
1	the only album that ha all the song from every era , from the 1940s-1960s .
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
0	i do not know what happened , but i have been on the hunt for this album since i started listening to it . i must have listened to it over a hundred time since getting it ( at least ) .
1	# 1 : the first song on the album . it is a great song and a great album .
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song . i can not understand the word at all . the singer are not louder than the accompaniment , so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word , especially in a christmas carol . there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty .
1	this is a great speaker for my home theater . the sound is great and the price wa excellent .
0	another great song from one of the best rap/hip hop artist .
0	this band is just making one hit after another . i think they should make a few album and take their time to make them better rather than just releasing their one hit after another album . i wish they would just make one album that ha good song instead of trying to be the next big thing .
0	you can not put a price on a good record . this is one of the best record i have heard from this band in some time . the only thing i would change if i could is to make sure they put out a cd of cover of their song instead of all original material . although this is not a bad record ( a great song on it in fact , you can not put a price on a good record ) , i hope they make at least one more . i know there are fan out there , but if you are this good , give me a new song on this cover cd .
0	i would have to say this is the best rihanna album . i love rihannas music .
0	i like the song but do not like the lyric .
0	it is not a bad album , but it is just not good .
0	nothing good worth mentioning but picture perfect ! .that tracc with brandy wa o.k an dumb s * t shouldve been without snoop an blacc ty .
1	this is the best live album i have ever listened to . i have listened to the album from pearl jam , foo fighter , the door and the door and the door and the door and the door and the door the door and the door and the door . this is a great album to give to your young child . i have listened to all of them . this is the best live album i have ever listened to .
0	i have always had a problem with the lyric on the cd . i have had this one since the cd wa released . i have tried to listen to the lyric a few time , but i just can not get into them . i can not get into the music . i like the music a lot . i do not know why , but i like it . i do not know why , but i like it . i like all the song on the cd . i like them all . i especially like i can not make you love me and when you say nothing at all . i like swingin the blue a lot . i really like it . i like it a lot . i like it a lot . i like it a lot . i like it a lot , a lot .
0	so many great song . so many great singer . so many great instrument . i love the band . i love their music . i believe in their music . i believe in their mission . i believe that the music they make is real . i am in awe of their talent .
0	i wanted to buy this cd because of the lyric . the song is about a man who doe not wan na live his life . when he get to heaven , he tell his friend that he doe not wan na live his life and he go on his way . the song is great . i hope the replacement play again .
0	my opinion of this song is that it is not really a great song . it is a good song that i can not stand to hear over and over . it is not really a good song .
1	this is great .
0	
0	i love the music of this band . i listened to it on a plane ride to florida recently . it wa great .
1	i really wish they would do more cover . this turned into an amazing project for their fan . thank you shinedown !
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick !
1	this album is beautiful , with a great blend of genre .
1	i remember when this song first came out , it wa hot . i am from the 80 so i listened to a lot of music . i remember buying this album , and the song wa on the cd . i do not think i bought the album , but it is on my hard drive . i am glad i bought it . this song is great .
0	i am so happy that i got to see the dead from their first concert at the palladium in 77 !
0	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyratically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am bias that way .
1	i love this band ! they are awesome !
1	this album is a great album . i enjoy the mix of style and the diversity of music . the song sinister urge is a good example of what the album is . the song is a good mixture of heavy riff and heavy vocal .
1	this song is great . it is a feel good song but it is very meaningful to all those around u . this song is great and it make me feel like a better person every time i hear it . i love this song and i love jeremy camp !
1	i am a big fan of country music . i like to listen to my own music . i wa told that this album wa done by a guy named leon bridge who worked with johnny paycheck , and some other people . i do not know what they had to do with the music on this album , but i do know that it is a very good country album . there are two song on here that i like , but the others are not my favorite . other song like i believe in you are very nice , and i have always been a fan of that song .
0	the beatles were already a band with a strong fan base . this album did not do anything to improve their fan base . it did increase their fan base of fan that would like their music . i am a beatles fan , but i do not really buy their album or anything like that . this album might have been better if it had been released a bit earlier .
1	kelli is a great singer and great actress . i can see why she is the only one in this group who had an actual college education . it is strange that she is the only one who ha a college degree . i have a lot of respect for her a an artist .
0	the vocal are great , but the band performance is a little lackluster .
1	if you are a amy fan this is the album for you . it is a real amy fan album , and the only way to know that is to actually listen to it . there are some really great song here , and she really doe an amazing job at singing .
1	i really like this guy andy williams and his album . i agree with the person who said this album is one of the best album of 2012 .
0	the album cover is misleading . the album contains a lot of song that are not related to each other . i do not think this album is very good .
0

1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few track took me back to dylan juda moment , i still recommend this wonderful series . my baby fell asleep within 20 minute of first firing it up , and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love for the pixy to share with me in the future . the stone one is good too . but mike , please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven , for u purist .

1	this is a great album . it is not a good a the other sum 41 album i have heard of theirs , but it is still an awesome listen . they have a much better singing voice than they do on you can not put a price on a good record , and the writing is better . however , for me , i like this album much more than the other one . it is a much cleaner sounding album , and it really make me want to hear more from them . this is the best sum 41 album i have heard in some time .
1	a very nice collection of song .
0	
0	this is definitely an album that i would have enjoyed listening to while i wa sick of the old song . the album is great !
1	this is one of those rare song that make the entire album . it is the only song i can listen to all day , and have repeated many time . this is a great song . and it is rare that a song can become so powerful that it becomes the only song on an album . it is a great song . and i am happy to have it on an album like this . it is a song i have listened to over and over again . this is one of the few song that i have heard that i could listen to over and over again . i mean , you could listen to this song 20 or 30 time and it would still be new .
1	it is a great album , i really liked it . it is very easy to listen to , and the song are just so beautiful and the singer is very talented . i would recommend this album a a great album for a wedding , or any event that you might want to surprise people with .
1	the song one more time is a great song . this is an excellent album . the album is excellent . the song is excellent . the album is excellent . i love this album . i love this album .
1	i love this song and on top of it all it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device .
1	i have been a total crap to you and
0	this song is a little bit better on youtube than the original . this song is good . this song is good . this song is good . it is just a little bit better on youtube . this song is good .
0	so i have been trying to get my wife to stop watching video where the guy singing/playing the guitar is the same age a his girlfriend , and is about 59. i just can not . i have tried all the time is money excuse , and now i have resorted to the my girlfriend is hot excuse . anyway , this song is pretty bad . the guitar solo is awful . the voice just doe not sound right . i hate it . i really hate it . i really hate it .
0	i got this album because it wa out on the radio , but i have listened to it about 15 time in the last two month . i love the song i am a goner i have a song on sound cloud also that i like a lot , but the album that i like the most is the album the one this music is so good .
1	this is a great song . i wa expecting a great song but this really is
1	i think this song is one of the most beautiful of all time .
1	i have been a fan of ani williams since i saw her live in my town . i have been a fan of her for year . i love the music and i like her style . i would buy her album if i could .
0	this ha been the soundtrack to my life for year . the song were so personal to me and it really made me think . i have listened to this on my walkman for year .
1	this album is the best album of all time . the only problem is , it is not my favorite album . this album is very good and the band is amazing .
1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric . i sang this song at a best friend wedding in the 1970s . then at his son , and now for the daughter . crazy thing is , when i wa younger , john denver wa a good friend . i miss him still .
1	! i am not a renegade fan ! but i am a kansa city cowboy !
1	this song is so great .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
1	this song wa on an episode of the show duck dynasty and i love it . i love the band , and i do not think they are too high energy .
0	what is wrong with record company these day ? everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hit , ultimate , essential , box set or whatever hit package that basically consist of all the same song , give or take one or two exception . this hit package is no different . amy fan , you already have all this - there is no need to buy it . what is up with amy anyway ? what audience is she trying to speak to ? her old christian audience , pop audience , adult comtemporaray audience , all of them ?
0	no . - i have heard this song about 10 time now and the lyric are stuck in my head . the voice of amy is amazing and the song are very catchy and i like the arrangement , but i just can not get over the fact that she is singing at a high pitch . i do not know if she is singing about a big , fat pig or if she is singing a big fat pig ( which is supposed to be a joke ) . if you are a amy fan , you will not like this song . even if you do not like her music , at least you should try to listen to it at least once .
0	this album is a great bargain and i love the guitar work . i have got a copy of this on cd and i am looking forward to getting the vinyl .
0	the sound quality is poor . youtube ha a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality .
1	i like the music you put on your cd . i like the song on this cd . they are more than just song . i like the way the music can bring you to a place of god . i like the way the song bring you to a place of god .
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing . sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and allows you to be with your own thought .
1	i really like this song , and the vocal are well done .
1	i love the music and never have a bad word to say about any band . the grateful dead wa a big part of my musical life .
0	the first cd by the new horseshoe is pretty good . i have only heard their first cd , but it wa good . i would like to hear more from them .
1	this cd just rock .
1	i really like this cd , and i think it is great .
1	this song is very nice , but it is very short . it is not a bad song at all , but it is just not long enough to make it interesting .
0	i do not have this song on my music and i did not order this song must take charge off. ? and hate to write such lengthy review
1	i thought the music wa very nice and the lyric were good , so i bought this album . i thought it wa a great album and thought it would be a nice addition to my collection . however , i have to say there are some song that i could not understand and thought the song wa not sung correctly . for example , if you wan na be a star , do you have to be a loser ? is very catchy . the lyric to i do not want to be a star , but i would rather be a loser are very clear . i do not wan na be a star , i would rather be a loser is a bit confusing . i do not wan na be a star , but i could be a loser is very funny . i do not wan na be a star , i would rather live with a loser is not very funny . i do not wan na be a star , but i do not wan na be a loser is also not very funny . so , i would like to see a better performance of this song , if possible .
1	i love how this album ha a very good sound , with a very good production . the song are different , but nice all the same .
1	this album is great .
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past 30 year than dokken . even without george , without jeff , and a weakened ( and at time embarrassing ) don , this band is still one-of-a-kind . no matter the lineup , dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release . jon levin is incredible . never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george . the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay . levin is that good . the first and last 3 song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the 5 tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable .
1	a very nice album with a lot of nice song . the first one is a slow song with a nice melody . the second one is a fun song . the third one is a sad song with a nice melody and rhythm . it wa my favorite song on the album .
0	this is a good song , but it is a boring song . i love the kiss version too .
1	it wa a hard decision to make this record . i love em all , but i did the best i could , and i hope you do the same . i love em all . i love em all . but , i wa forced to come to my own conclusion . i love them all . this record will always be the best . i have to give it an 8 .
1	this cd ha some of the best song ever ! i have to say that i have been a huge nirvana fan since i wa a kid and this cd is like a trip down memory lane . i love the fact that this cd is a tribute to their music . i also love that most of their song have been left off of the album , so the fan do not have to wait around for them . i especially love that the album is a tribute to one of their biggest fan , kurt cobain .
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one .
0	this album is one of the best album by rihanna . i love her song , and i love her voice .
1	i have been looking for a cd with a song that i had never .
0	i do not know what else i could say about this cd . it is one of the best holiday album .
0	
1	i wa not disappointed by this album . i like it because it is different from what i hear on the radio . i like that this album ha a mix of different style . for example , i like the song blessed are the peacemaker and the mighty one . i also like the song savior and praise to jesus
0	this singer ha lost his way . his song do not have any substance and do not move me .
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist , wonderful .
1	i wa extremely disappointed that this song did not make the final cut for the documentary . it is an amazing song . the only thing i would want to see in a video for .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
1	this is an enjoyable album ! if you like traditional bluegrass music it is here for you ! i like that there are no boutique artist on this album , a there is so much more variety on other album . this album ha a very traditional sound , a well a a very modern sound . the main reason this album is so good is because of the excellent writing and the beautiful arrangement that add to the music . if you do not like traditional bluegrass , then this album may not be for you . all in all , this is a good album for any bluegrass fan .
0	i really love this album , but this album is not very good . the worst part is that nicki minaj is on it .
1	great album . i like the song on this album , but i do not consider this album to be a great work of art . the production is excellent and there is a lot of song on this album , but i do not consider this album to be a good a the time they are a-changin or a hard rain a- gon na fall . there are some song that did not make the grade for me . i do not consider this album to be a great work of art .
1	a great album for the young and also the young at heart . i think that it is an album you should listen to a often a possible .
0	i loved this cd . i hope to hear some more .
0	when i first played this cd , i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez . then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following : all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group . not sure what this is supposed to mean , but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to . do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else .
1	this song is a part of the theme for the annual i just wan na dance charity event . it is a fun song to dance to .
0	this is definitely an 80 song . my first impression of this song wa , this is an 80ish song ? i did not think so . after all i knew it wa from 80 , but i did not see it a an 80ish song . but after listening again to this song and listening to it again in my head , it start to make sense . it is a very , very 80 song , but it is not 80 music . it is like the first song everyone doe on a new album that is not 80 music . it make a big difference to the overall perception .
1	this album is awesome ! i love it ! i really like it ! i recommend it to anyone .
0	a nice rendition of the traditional , with a nice arrangement and the vocal have great depth .
1	i just recently started listening to this song again and i really like it . it is a very catchy song . i also think it would be a good song to sing to a friend of yours who is gone . i also like that he is singing to his dog and not to a girl .
0	*
1	waltz is a beautiful song . the melody is very nice . this is the end is a very interesting song . the lyric are very nice and the vocal are very good . it is a good song . it is a mellow rock song .
1	recording quality is not that great .
1	i bought two copy of this album and listened to it on both . i put it on random and randomly on random . i never knew what wa going to
1	this is a very positive and happy christmas song .
1	i like this song . it ` s a good song ! a good song , and it ` s a good song !
1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror .
1	awesome music .
0	i like the first 2 verse i do not like the last 2 verse .
1	great compilation of original song that are really good . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	i like the song the way we were by garbage . it is one of their best song , and i like it . i can not really decide if the guy singing doe not care about his girl or if he just doe not care about anyone but himself .
1	this is a very good song . it will be a wonderful addition to your worship song and will bring you to worship with a great vibe !
1	i love joe augustine . i purchased this album because i loved the god bless the child song . i love joe and this is my favorite album .
0	the only reason why i have given this rating is because of the hope it will be released again . it wa released on a cd only so it will probably be on itunes only ( if it get there ) .
0	downloaded just fine . not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than i did not like the song and it work just fine .
1	this is a great cd .
1	this song ha great production , great lyric , and the best beat i have ever heard in my life . it is a great song .
0	there is a lot to say about this record . it is a great piece of music and ha a lot of potential . i think it is what the band ha been trying to do for year and it is finally paying off . i am a big fan of the band and will definitely buy this album when it come out . this album is the best i have heard since the white album or the wall . i may have to buy this .
1	this just make me want to go outside and do something really fun , but not something that i have to do . it is a great message of love and life . the type of love and life that i really want to live . and it make me feel like i want to go outside with my boyfriend and have some fun .
1	this is a great song ! it is a very fun song !
1	this version of the song is so beautiful ! it is a perfect match ! it is a perfect match ! it is a perfect match and it is perfect !
1	i think this will be my new favorite album . i just love this album .
0	music is great-it will not download to my phone ! ?
0	it is a very good song . i like all the lyric . it ha a good beat to it . i like all the lyric . it ha a good beat to it , and i like all the lyric .
0	i really liked the song , but i do not like the lyric and i think it is a generic song . i did not understand why anyone would listen to it .
0	the first song is the most disappointing , because it is the same song over and over again . it is just a good a the song he doe when he doe his stand up , and i do not think a stand up need to be that repetitive . it just come across a tired and stale .
1	found it very easy to purchase directly from my kindle , love it . look forward to purchasing more song in the future
1	this is a great album . i enjoy listening to it . i do not think i have ever heard an album like this . it is a true original . it ha a lot of great song . the only thing is that the album is too short . it would be even better had it been longer . the song are very good .
1	i really enjoyed the cd , but i think it will be better if the vocal were lower .
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state .
0	i have listened to this album many time . i think it is good , but not a good a some other album . the lead singer doe not sound like a lead singer should sound . i think it is just a little overhyped . i have never been to a concert , but i have heard the song on the radio . i will say this is a pretty good band . i would say that they do a good job . i would like to see them play a lot more . they are not bad , but they are not quite a good a they could be . i think they could be good if they had a female lead singer . i think they would have a much better sound .
1	i have had the cd for a little over a week and i am still really enjoying it . i would definitely recommend this album to anyone !
1	i bought this cd for my daughter for christmas . i thought it wa a great choice . it wa pleasant and easy to sing along to . the only thing i could think of wa that the song wa cut short at the end . the lyric are great and the melody is beautiful .
1	this is a great cd . i would recommend it to anyone . i would give it 5 star .
0	i buy the song but they never let me download it into my computer
0	i have been listening to this album for about a week , and i am absolutely obsessed with it . it is the best thing i have heard today .
1	i love it , i love it ! it is just a gorgeous song ! and i love the whole album . but i do not understand why people are so critical of this song . i love it !
1	this is one of my favorite of all time !
1	this song is pretty damn catchy . especially the part in the chorus when she scream .
0	the music is okay , but the lyric are really , really boring . the only interesting thing about the lyric is the bad little girl bit , so if you do not like that , then the rest of the lyric just are not that interesting .
1	i love he is singing about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd .
1	this is my favorite song on this album , i like it a lot .
1	another get out of your seat raise your hand and praise god song . this song touch the heart and the spirit
1	lin-manual miranda is an outstanding composer ! he is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history a his inspiration and a musical form that allows much information in the shortest time !
0	
0	great song , i love how you can tell how much he loved her . it also show how he wa a very close friend to her , so you can tell that he wa very sad when she died . he wa a great singer and guitarist .
1	i have listened to this album many time . this album is very well done and beautifully performed . i really love the violin and the viola solo .
1	i really like this album ! my favorite song is little bird
1	janet jackson is truly an incredible talent .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked . the 3 song on the radio are the only one that are worth a s * , the rest of the album suck . which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry . i would recommend others to only buy the song they like . and leave the rest .
0	i found this album to be really fun to listen to . i really like the song .
0	it wa just ok .
0	i bought this one for my wife a a birthday present . she can not stand the beach boy , but i thought she would like it .
0	i am a jewel fan . i used to not get her music , and i wa really upset that she wa starting to put out music that wasnt a good a her old music . i am glad i finally got her cd , a i heard her singing new song . i will probably listen to it a lot , especially if she doe another cd . i do not know if i want to hear a collection of old song , but i know i want to hear some new one .
0	i have had this cd for over a month now and i still have not had the time to really check it out .
1	this song is a great introduction to the album that i think is an all around great record . the drum are well done and the guitar is a treat to listen to . the vocal is not a challenge to listen to , but is very impressive . the song is not a good a a great version of this song , but there really is not any reason to not listen to it . the song is good , but the playing is very good .
0	this is a collection of song by a radio station . i found these while searching for song by elson john . some of them are interesting , some of them are not . the production is good , but i believe the song were written by bob dylan , elton john former manager . i give the album 2 star .
0	b is definitely the weakest of the three . the vocal are toosoft and the song are very long , it is not worth the $ 14 dollar .
1	this is the music from the opening scene of the movie , layer cake , wherein daniel craig play a fascinating , vulnerable role a a middle man for a recreational medication group in the uk . interesting concept for a movie , and the music grab your attention , also .
1	? ! ? what can i say but i liked it . liked it a lot ! nicely done .
1	the killer is a great band . they have a very unique style of music , that combine heavy rock and a lot of great acoustic song . they have got a great live sound . i think the most amazing thing about the killer is that they can go from the most popular band in the world , to almost not making it on the radio , but still , they are successful . their song are very easy to listen to , and it make me feel like i am on a really great party . they are super talented ; they really make a great live band .
0	this album is horrible . the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job , but david lee roth should be put out to pasture . i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance . problem : 1. david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa 1978. a such , he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly . 2. he only sings half of the lyric , the rest are spoken . 3. he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric .
0	i wanted to like this album . i did , but i could not get past the lack of live version of some of the song .
1	i bought this album , and i like it ! if you like zaba , then you will like this album . it is different but in a positive way .
0	the album is better than it single and the single are not even better than the album but the album is much better than the single .
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
1	a very strong set of song , both lyrically and melodically . and robin is in good voice throughout .
0	the song would have let u download the song .
0	i purchased the original the beach boy 1964/1965 album and the beach boy ii cd set . i have been listening to them for year now . like my father and all my friend who grew up with them .
1	this is one of the best cd i have ever listened to . it ha all of the element that make an album work well - great song , a strong album concept , a great production , and a great mix of genre .
1	i bought a cd from amazon and it arrived on time , a promised .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that .
1	this is my first time listening to this album , but it is definately a good album . they do not repeat the song that are on the album very often , but the song are still good . if you like a classic rock and roll album , then this is the album for you .
1	when i wa in high school my friend and i would play this album for hour . i have listened to this album a few time . i love this band !
1	this song wa very beautiful . the lyric were very beautiful and the song wa very beautiful .
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
0	i can not imagine why i would order this . my wife must have done this . the song is trite . the lyric are predictable . if you love mope rock , this song is for you !
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .
0	this one is not good at all . used to be a fan of his but he is fallen . he is fallen far . it is a sad effort to be honest .
1	i have been a fan of this band forever and i think they have more potential than the average band . they are great live and i love their music . they are new to me and they sound great . i love their music , especially their song the real thing . i think their music is original and i like their energy .
1	thank you belinda for recording this song ! it is fun upbeat and showcase belindas vocal talent . just downloaded yesterday and have listened to the song about 20 time . make you feel good and it is so wonderful to have belinda put out another great pop hit ! a+
1	this song and album are good . i like the chorus . it is a good song .
1	ahmad ha been one of the most influential and versatile pianist of our time . his recording are a must for any serious music lover . the music is simply amazing and the playing is stunning .
0	in the late 1970s there wa a yes-inspired wannabee band called starcastle . starcastle were goodish , they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album , but they were not in the same league with yes . starcastles arrangement were softer , le articulate , and their lyric were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace . you know , star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist , but what wa the point ? i regret to say this , but fly from here sound like starcastle .
1	the song ha a great melody that will always get stuck in your head .
0	really bad song i am not a big rap fan but i am not a fan of this song
1	i first heard metal machine music by lou reed in a local radio station where it wa played . i listened to it on repeat for the next 30 year . i now own almost every lou reed album and this is the only one i bought while in high school . i am an original lou reed fan and this album is just my favorite .
0	i do not know what it is about this song , but i like it very much . it is very good . it is a very good song . i like how it is very positive . i like how it ha a great beat to it . i really like how it ha a lot of good lyric to it . it is definitely a very good song .
1	a great song . this is a classic to any song collection .
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of thereal sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
0	it is hard to imagine that the b52s have been around for over 25 year . they are my favorite band .
0	this song reminds me of my favorite song drip drop by the backstreet boy .
1	- i don t think is worth it . i will not buy it .
1	i love this cd !
1	this is one of my favorite jewel song . i will give it a 10-out-of-10 . i wa introduced to jewel when i wa in the first grade and my favorite song wa this is the way it is . i have never been able to get it out of my mind . i have always been a jewel fan . i love jewel voice and i love the song . this song is a classic .
1	this song wa good . the lyric were great , and the music wa great . i would highly recommend this song .
1	this is a great album . i have been a long time fan and i wa surprised by how much i liked it . i wa afraid it would have been another slow ballad but it is not . really great album .
0	i am not a huge fan of lizs , but i am a fan of music that is not offensive or vulgar .
0	some of these song are so bad they are funny . i kept bandy bandy , by zap mama featuring erykah badu , which is nice . also kept two other track , which i shall not name , but only for my really bad song playlist .
1	not really , it is mostly the opposite here . it is pretty much the same a the first album , but a couple of them are very different . this is the album where he is at his own lyrical best . he is still very much a rocker . but he is not playing guitar a much and he is definitely not a focused musically . he play piano and sings almost his entire time . and he is got a killer voice . he ha a lot of personality in this album and he try to play it out , even though it is not the best . it is a good album and i think he wa a great vocalist . he is in a great place right now .
0	excellent presentation , but it is the worst floyd album ever ! they should regret to had produced it .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
0	the only song on this album that wa not terrible , it wa ok. it wa a nice , gentle album that wa better than most of the other crap out there . but it wa not good .
0	i love this song , it is a great song with a great beat . the song doe not have to be too long and it should not be boring . the sound is great also . overall i would give this song a 9.5/10 .
1	i have listened to this album twice . the first time i wa in the middle of a road trip and the second time wa on this trip , so i never listened to it for a while . however , a soon a i had the chance to listen to it again i wa extremely pleased with it .
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
1	this song is soooooooooooo beautiful . the lyric are so poetic . that is why i like this song so much . i really liked it . this wa the first song i memorized . it is just so good . i think it is a really powerful song , it really touch a lot of people . i wa surprised that there were so many people who liked this song . it really surprised me . it ha a great message .
0	this is a great product for people that like to draw . i have a sketch book and this group is perfect for it .
0	this is a good song .
0	_ . _ . _ . _ .
0	the song is very nice and relaxing . it is very uplifting and very positive . you can listen to it and relax . it brings a smile to your face . i love it !
0	this is the second best radiohead album , after the album with all the instrument .
0	i thought it wa a solid album , with decent song and a decent cover/title .
1	what can i tell you . the band is so good .
0	if you like song that are on the heavy side and rock out , this is the album for you .
0	this song is not bad . the lyric are all the same , but the sound quality is great . i would listen to this song again .
0	ive been listening to this cd for a long time . i think this is the best cd in the band .
1	this song is by far one of the most outstanding song i have ever heard . i love it . it is perfect and i can not wait to listen again .
1	i love johnny hartman and i have always been a fan of hers . a far a i know she is a very talented singer .
0	this song is so bad and ha been stuck in my head for over a month . i get it . the song is very catchy and ha a good melody but it is just so bad and i cringe .
1	really nice piano playing . very nice melody and chord . one of the best album i have heard in a long time .
0	i cried at the end of this one for me and i am a big fan of the waylon/jessi song . waylon always ha some word that can heal the listener , and this is one of those song . it is not the best way to go to the bathroom or to the hospital , but we love it .
0	i listened to this album all the way through , and i am still not sure if i like it . it is so different from other album i have listened to so far , but then again , i have never heard a dubstep album to compare it to .
1	this wa a great buy , i wa so excited to find this album , but i wa disappointed that it wasnt released on cd . it is a great album and i will probably buy it again !
1	this is one of the best christian rock album . all of the song are very good and have great song .
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
1	this one is a no-brainer
1	i think it is a very good song . i like the song . i think it would be a good song to sing because i love to sing .
0	love the music , but not the lyric .
1	it sound like a saw wa being used to cut the wood . the song is very over produced and all of the song sound the same
1	for a song that is so short , this one is really long . the song is really long , but it is very catchy .
0	i am a big fan of joe augustine and wa looking for something fast , easy , and enjoyable to listen to . i feel the same way about this album . it is great for a quick fix .
0	it is one of the best song from the past couple of year . it is a little too much fun for me to sit through .
1	i just want to say that i have been listening to this cd for week and week and week . it is perfect .
1	i love adam voice and i love the song he is written . this is a great compilation of adam music . this is a great compilation of song . i like this album .
1	a great album . the production is good and i enjoy the songwriting style . the lyric are better than the previous two , although they are still pretty juvenile and juvenile lyric . i am a sucker for the vocal , and this album ha some great vocal . it is not my favorite sum 41 album , but it is close .
1	this song is so awesome ! it rock !
0	i love this album , especially the first disc . i wish i would have known him when i wa younger .
1	i love this album . it is the first time i have ever heard this artist , and my only regret is not having picked this album up when it first came out . i heard it on the radio and wa thrilled . i love the variety of style this artist ha incorporated into these 5 song . i think it would be difficult to find an artist with so many different style and sound in one release . this album is great for people who like pop music and are fan of female artist . i would recommend this album to a friend , and would recommend buying this cd a a gift for someone you love . i know i would have bought it for myself .
0	i just purchased this song . i really want to listen to it , but i can not find the song anywhere .
0	this new mp3 player is not working .

1	i have downloaded this cd a number of time . i have learned a few thing that i never knew about bob dylan .
1	
1	always love to listen to waylon and jessi .
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy . i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago . kind of like the 72/73 miami dolphin . i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl . same here with chicago . 60 and 70 with their intense musical and political statement . and then 80 and 90 mega wimpy commercial hit . chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60 and 70 .
0	the album ha a lot of good song , but the producer , jackyl and his team are not doing an adequate job . they are not producing a great album . the album is full of filler , and the song are average at best . it is just another pop album from jackyl and his team . i wa expecting something different .
0	i have been a fan of fleetwood for a very long time . this is a nice cd , but i thought it sounded a little too fleetwood mac .
0	this is one of my all time favorite song ~ i got a new phone and wanted this a my ring tone like i had on my android . i down loaded the song and attempted to listen to it and got nothing but static . it wa a waste of my time and money !
0	very good song , but it ha a lot of production issue , and it is a bit out of vogue for today ear .
1	i wa very disappointed that this song did not appear in the documentary . it wa a really great song , and i love it . the only one thing i would want to know in the video for this song would be a little more context for the lyric , however .
0	awesome mix it up in that it is more like a cross between electronic music and house and techno . my favorite track wa the intro with the guitar and the vocal , but the other 7 track were average .
1	this is one of her best song . it is really good in every way . i love johnny hartman and i love all her album .
0	oh please . whomever keep saying pearl jam is better than nirvana need to let up . pearl jam is worse than nirvana , yet i despise both . they both sold out . vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet , and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major . yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him . he had always been lazy , and nevermind reflects that . it is pure pop-rock on par with bon jovi , and he refused to admit it .
1	i can relate to this song all the way around because my father passed away in 2011 and he including my mother and i knew it wa his time to let go . i listen to this song in memory of him .
1	i love this music !
0	
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality .
1	this really is an awesome album . i enjoy this cd a lot .
1	i really like this album . i think this will be my new favorite album . i just love this album .
1	this is a great song to listen to while you are doing something else , like walking , or getting a massage , or driving , or whatever .
1	we all listen to different music ( classical , country , heavy metal , blue , rap , pop , folk . ) so it is rare when we like the same band . this is the band . this is album is wonderful . not a stinker in the lot = )
1	this must have been the first lullaby i ever heard . i love it .
1	i have purchased this product and after using it for a few week , i am extremely impressed with it performance . the sound quality is excellent , and the price is very reasonable . i have recommended this speaker to my friend .
0	mandy , you have such a great voice and a great body of work . i would give this album 5 star except the lyric are stupid and it took a while to decipher some of the lyric . i would also give this album 5 star if it wa produced well but i do not think it wa . the production on this album is pretty bad but i guess it is all part of the process .

0	i hate radiohead
1	i grew up listening to this song a well . i love it !
0	i like this song , the only thing i do not like about it is that the lyric are in english . i hope you can make this into an official song because it would be really nice to have a christmas song that you can actually sing along to .
1	i would recommend this album to anyone . the album is worth it . i would recommend this album to anyone . it is worth it . this album is worth it . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	this album is my favorite of the album . it is good !
0	i have heard this song before , but i can not remember the name . i think it is from a movie , but i do not remember . it is just one of those song that sound like it wa made by a machine in the lab , and i do not like those one .
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
0	prince is definitely a genius ! his music is so creative ! i think everyone should listen to his music .
1	i am a bruce springsteen fan . i love bruce springsteen and e street band . i have been a fan since the early to mid 1980s . i started with the e street band cd and have purchased 3 more cd from them since . this cd is not for the e street band fan . this is not a bruce springsteen album , it is bruce springsteins solo acoustic album . it is bruce springsteins only album released this year . this is not a bruce springsteen album , it is bruce springsteins solo acoustic album . it ha only one
1	if you have watched the tv show , then you already know how catchy the song are . the only difference between tv and the cd , is probably length . i have not actually verified this , but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer , and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show ? either way , a good time with good music .
1	liked it the first time i heard it , loved it again now
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound .
1	this is a great song to start off your friday . i listen to it on the way to the office every friday morning . set the day to be a positive experience no matter how your day end . great song .
1	i hate this song .
1	the band ha a very unique sound that is very easy to listen to . the music is fun , and i like the lyric a lot .
1	this is a really good cd . i would recommend this to everyone who like fleetwood mac .
1	i have been a fan of this band since i wa in college . they are one of my favorite band and i am so glad to see them getting the recognition they deserve . all three album are great .
1	first of all , i would like to say i am soooo glad i have finally found someone like her . she ha something special , and the album speaks for itself , she ha a voice that is unique and very individual .
1	this is a good cd . it is a good . it is a good song . it is a good song .
0	it is a fact that nothing can bring a person closer to their true self .
1	this is a great 1957 session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson . a fine clollection of bebop & ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant + eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum . from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha-cha , this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat . once again , great & rare music like this is only available a an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith : eighteen classic albums-which i purchased for about $ 20 .
0	the song is about a guy who wa on the verge of losing his job , but then he met god and he is now full of confidence .
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way , but after reading everyones review , i now see it is not me on a buzz . this song is just horrible . it is off-key , the vocalist can not carry a tune in a bucket , and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background ? a frank barone from everybody love raymond used to say , hooooly crap . thank god it is free and i could hit cancel on the download .
1	this song make me happy .
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
0	i really enjoyed the album ! i like the song but i would have liked to hear a little more of the live sound . but i guess that is why it is called the live sound . i would recommend this album to anyone who like the beatles .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
1	this album is excellent . the song are great , the production is great and the musicianship is excellent . this is a great compilation of song , and i think that this is a really good way to make it . i really like this album .
0	i have a hard time understanding the fuss over this album . it is got no depth , no real idea , nothing to say . it is just a bit of a slog .
1	old school music . the best from puerto rico . isla del encanto . bonita perla bonito san juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
1	this cd is very good . i would recommend this cd to anyone . i would give 2 star .
0	ton of scratch and record skip .
1	this song is a good song .
1	this is an album that i would put on my top 10 list for worsh .
0	god imagine dragon are a one hit wonder that have not gone away .
1	this is an album of old school rock with some fun lyric and a catchy music . some of the song , such a the long way home , let u get high & go and the duh are really good .
0	i just heard light on for the first time . my first thought wa oh no ! this can not be your first real single . so i played it again and again . and again . nothing changed . no chill of excitement . nothing ! i wa a huge fan of this guy on idol and i loved how creative and original he wa . he made every song he sang sound like a modern hit . only to get a run of the mill , very basic , cliche , almost 80ish sounding rock song . complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest note ?
0	i love it !
0	this is the worst album ever . the album is really bad . the song is ok , but the album is like a piece of garbage . the album is horrible , even the song is terrible . this is a bad album .
1	, this is a great album ! the first thing i notice is the song . they are all very well done . the instrumentation is great . the vocal are great . the lyric are all very well done . the song are all very well done . the instrumentation is great . the vocal can all be described a very good . the lyric are all very well done . the instrumentation is great . the vocal have all been described a very good . the song have all been described a very good . the instrumentation is great . the vocal are all been described a very good . the instrumentation is great . the guitar have all been described a very good . the guitar have all been described a very good . the vocal have all been described a very good . the instrument have all been described a very good . the vocal have all been described very good . the vocal have all been described a very good . the instrumentation is great . all the song are very well done . the vocal are all been described a very good . all the song are very well done . the vocal are all been d described a very good . all the song are very well done . the guitar are all been described a very good . the guitar are all been described a very good . all the song are very well written . the vocal are all been described a very good .
0	a very nice song , with nice lyric .
1	this song is so different than the rest of the song ive heard this year . it a very different song from all the other song ive heard this year . it ha a great harmony and the female vocal are very nice . the male vocal are not a nice . but it still a great song .
0	this is definitely a bad album .
1	this song is a great song that anyone who love a good , old fashioned , teary-eyed love story can appreciate . it is also a great song that anyone who ha a daughter can appreciate . but , you know , no matter if you are a woman or a man , you know that this song applies to all human being .
1	this is an excellent group . i love the music .
1	i do not know about you but my favorite song is by the dixie chick . they are a great band , and their song is very catchy and fun . this song is also a good song , and ha great lyric to it .
1	i bought this because i wanted to see if it had any kind of meaning other than the obvious . i am glad i bought it because i felt like it wa worth the money .
0	an ok song , but the vocal are not very good .
0	a good attempt at a rocker , but no substance .
1	i have bought other album by paul taylor and i have to say that this is by far the best album . i have listened to it many time and i never tire of listening .
0	what the hell is this music ?
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
0	this album is great . i have been using this album a my main source of music ( since it is free ) and it is been having an effect on my own music . the sound quality is excellent . i am surprised that there is not much more of a full sound , but it is still really good . the only thing is , i can not seem to get it to loop .
1	i love this band and i am glad that i purchased their new album . this new album is good . it ha a lot of good song on it .
1	this wa my favorite album of the week . i really liked it . i guess i have a thing for country rock .
0	this album is just a bunch of song that repeat the same idea over and over again . very repetitive .
0	i love this record . it is fun and interesting .
1	i enjoyed the song , the lyric were easy to understand and the song wa well sung . this song is not very hard to play , but you will still have to work hard to learn it . this is a good listen in my opinion .
1	this is the best album i have ever heard . i have been listening to it non stop for the past week . i love this album .
0	do not buy this particular version if you are looking for the explicit version . this version is an edited or radio version .
1	i love listening to this song and i think it is amazing .
1	i love this jazz album . the music is very nice . i would recommend it to anyone who like jazz . the music is very good . the music is very nice . i would recommend it to anyone who like jazz .
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son-in-law a a joke . because it is . all the 4 & 5 star review crack me up ! especially the one from the holier-than-thou hard core dylan fan . particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it . lolololol ! the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself . the 5 star review are so serious ! unbelievable . ( same thing on itunes- if you want some great entertainment , read the review there for both camp .
0	i have been a fan of lou reed work since i heard walk on the wild side by jefferson airplane , and after reading a review about this cd i finally decided to buy it . i am now very happy i did . i have not listened to music a loud a i would like to , but i could not stop listening , even when i wa driving . i did not like the first few song on the album . i felt like it wa too fast . i actually thought i would be better off with a slower album . i did not know about walk on the wild side , so i did not know that some of the song were previously heard . i have now listened to the whole album a number of time and i am still very happy with it . the cd is a great purchase and i would recommend it to others .
0	the song is a perfect ending to a great album . i love the song and the recording is great . it is sad that natalie ha gone through so much and is still touring . i hope she is good .
1	this is great song !
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .
0	i bought this on amazon for my kindle . it wa a pain in the a * to get it though .
0	i wa excited when i heard it wa a book version of the radio show and had a hard time understanding some of the sentence . it wa a good listen though !
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard . she is also one of the most under-rated songwriter in the country . the story wa a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90 that included jennifer kimball . the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were/are inspired , and at time , their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear . my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine ( from story - angel in the house ) and eye in the sky ( from jonatha brooke - back in the circus ) .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .

0	i bought the album because i liked the title track and the album wa $ 12 . i have listened to the cd several time and i would say the best song are jezebel and i am too sexy . all of the other song are pretty good , but i do not think i will ever buy any of them because i do not think the cd will last that longer .
1	this song is just amazing . it is so good i do not know where to start . i have been listening to this cd for a few month , and i really like it . i would say it is one of the best song of the year . i do not know where to start . i give this song 5 star .
1	my mother used to sing this to me when i wa a kid . it will take me a long time to get through the song .

0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
0	it is the clean version just not on youtube
0	i had no idea that 9 out of 10 song were not original recording and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible . do not waste your money if you want original . i had forgotten how bad k-tell recording were
0	this album is the best album of all time . i love this album . however , the lyric are terrible . the song are great and the band is very good . the album is very good . i love this album . this album is one of my all-time favorite .
0	this cd wa originally released in a stereo version with the original mono transfer . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favourite album by far .
0	this cd player case is broken .
1	this song is a great example of this band alternative sound . the song is very fun to listen to . it is a song that really ha a lot of energy in it , and the melody and lyric are really great .
0	: i have been listening to this song for day now .
1	this is a great album . it is very well produced . it sound great . i would recommend this album to anyone who like country music . great music . you will not be disappointed .
0	a great song . it wa the first song i ever listened to on the radio when i wa a kid and it still hold a special place in my heart . i still have the cassette . this song is so unique and different because it is not what you would expect . the guitar solo wa a little too loud but the song is good otherwise . the lyric are fantastic a well and the chorus is awesome . it is a great song , and i will listen to it again soon .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away . kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill , from marrying kim kardashian , to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy-winning album of the year . now , for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no .
1	i have enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i have found all my oldie but goody . sound quality is excellent .
0	*
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse . they have really grown together a a band . the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album , but they have not lost the depth . jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life , rather than dwelling on the past . the vocal are also much more powerful ; jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing .
0	i am a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album , virgin & philistine , but with personnel change and a different vibe , this album pale in comparison . terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion , which is still one of my favorite from the mid-80s .
0	*
1	i am a big fan of this band . the album is great .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
0	very disappointed . the song i really want it are not on here . but it is still a good cd . if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it .
0	when i saw this album and read some of the review , the lyric of the song , i thought it wa pretty good . i have since listened to it a few time and have really enjoyed it . the lyric are very well done . i do hope that desrosiers is able to make a full-length album . i think that she can . i am sure that she can . i think it will be a great album . the song are really deep and the music is really good . i think that desrosiers should get the chance to make her own version of the little house book . this album is just too much of a let down . it is just not good . it is very disappointing .

1	i really like how the music is made . this is a beautiful song that would be a great addition to any
1	i like this cd . the song i have put on my personal cd collection are pearly gate and just say no . the song pearly gate is the best song because it is a hymn you can sing with other song . i like the song just say no because it is a hymn you can sing with other music .
1	this is one of my favorite . i like the song , the instrument , the vocal , the drum . i think the best thing about this song is the way the guitar and the drum go together . it is beautiful .

1	his father is known a high caliber musician , and his son is confirming the line of great and amazing artistic work . great cd for music collection . r .
1	very good song .
0	this album wa absolutely garbage . it wa my first time listening to dubstep . i have read that this album ha been out for a while , and i think i wa listening to the demo before the album wa released . i just wish there were more song on this album . a for the production quality , the sound are a little too dubstep for my liking .

0	his music is alright .
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me , it brings back all the memory
1	this song wa good . i like the lyric . it is a nice song .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
0	this album is a keeper . the most important thing , which i think a lot of people do not realize , is that kurt wa a very private person . he did not want anyone to know who he wa . he did not like the medium . he did not want to be known . he basically just did not want to be . kurt did not want any fame . kurt did not want any attention . kurt did not want any attention . he did not want any fame . he did not want any attention .
1	i found the song on this site , and i love it . i wa not charged for the item . i called to ask who had placed the order , they said they did not do it . she just said that she got them from the internet .
0	i never heard this album before , and i really liked it .
0	i would buy this product again .
0	not for everyone
1	this is an enjoyable album .
0	i just heard light on for the first time . my first thought wa oh no ! this can not be your first real single . so i played it again and again . and again . nothing changed . no chill of excitement . nothing ! i wa a huge fan of this guy on idol and i loved how creative and original he wa . he made every song he sang sound like a modern hit . only to get a run of the mill , very basic , cliche , almost 80ish sounding rock song . complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest note ?
0	my little sister and i love this song . we bought it a christmas present . we listened to it for about an hour . then we sat back and watched the big christmas movie on tv . we bought the dvd and put it in the front seat . we went out and played the cd in the car . then we both went to sleep . we listened to the cd last night when we got home . it is a good song . it is just not a huge hit . it is ok. i am not really sure what i am missing . i will stick with my little sister copy .
0	this song wa not good . the song is not moving , and it is just plain boring .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
1	this is the most beautiful song ever made . it is a very beautiful and sad song .
0	the song are all pretty good , but the vocal just can not stand up to the rest of the album . the vocal are great , but the song just do not have the substance to them that they need to stand up against a whole slew of other song on the same album .
0	i would like to say it is one of a kind . but , it is not . i give it eight out of ten .
0	the song is about a girl who had a heart-shaped scar on her back . it seems that she wa in love with a guy who could not see her because of her scar . she wa too shy to tell him that she loved him .
1	i really enjoyed this cd . i love the way she sings .
1	i heard this song on the radio and decided to listen to it and it made me feel so damn good . the opening song is so sexy and so sexy !
0	this song is stupid . and lame . it is not even a good rap song , it is just a lame rap song .
1	i have a new favorite song !
0	i just finished listening to this cd . i wa really surprised to see how much i liked it . it is a great cd . the song are all different and i like the fact that the voice is different . i want the cd to be a little longer .
1	i am glad i found this cd . i like the song . i listen to them often .
1	i am surprised that you do not even know is considered a ballad . it is definitely a song about love . the lyric are very touching and it really capture the special feeling that only love can provide . it is been awhile since i have listened to any song by this band and this is one of my favorite song of the year . i hope that the band record more song like this one in the future . it ha a good message and it is an easy song to listen to .
0	the first half of this cd is great . the second half is where the cd loses it . i wa really hoping they would be able to put out a cd of original material , and if they do , it will not be on this album . i like the cd , but the second half is what really kill it for me .
0	this song wa included in the second disc because of it positive lyric and catchy chorus .
0	having the lp were did the dvd come from ? being a crazy fan of the fox and it is mighty wurlitzer i bought the ( 3 ) album and have transfered them to cd . went to the last two midnight concert were there wasnt standing room in the building . seating about 4000+ now sf ha a world class organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city father can not get off their tail and get it done .
0	i would rate this cd a just ok. for the money there are better sounding version out there . this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless . it ha 4 bonus track , ironically from the u lp , which are already on the album . a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like - i will get you & baby it is you . i give it 2 star out of a possible 5 .
0	a great song , really catchy and fun . it is a great way to use some of your old song in a party . it is also a great party song .
0	i liked the song on this album , but i have not listened to it in a long time .
1	great cd . great album . great mix . kurt cobain is one of my very favorite artist and this is one of the best album i have ever heard . if you do not like nirvana , do not listen to this cd . if you love nirvana , buy this cd . if you are not a cobain fan , this cd is a great purchase . this is a great cd . i love this album .
1	very poor sound quality . lack the presence of one of the best singer of all time . whitney could not have been more convincing . she sounded like she wa sitting there in her room . very poor . lack the presence of one of the best singer of all time
1	i love the little melody in the beginning , but when it get to the part in the middle , i do not know .
0	this is a fun song . it is a good song to dance to .
1	i like it . it is catchy .
1	i have a few favorite song by this band . it so hard to choose just one . my favorite song is hush and my favorite artist is the men they could not hang . i love the music and the lyric . i love this band .
1	this album just make me want to listen to more adam lambert .
1	i like this song a lot it is a
1	this album rock ! i would recommend buying this album .
0	can not stand the voice , or the inst1rumentals in the back . i mean , whats the refund policy ? gad !
1	i am glad i bought this cd ! i am a huge fan of their previous cd . the song are awesome and the band is great .
1	this is my favorite song on the album . the guitar , the vocal , and the drum all work well together . the only thing that come across is that the song is a little long . i think that would be the only complaint .
0	this is the lowest form of music . it is following a predictable and waning formula . i have listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me . i have listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me .
0	i could not believe the amount of bad review that were put about the album . the album is absolutely awful .
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
1	this cd wa bought for my sister who is quite a fan of the band .
1	i like the song
0	pay atttention . from a mix tape and doe not have the whole song ( pointless )
0	i bought this album and wa so happy ( and surprised ) to see lou reed live . i can hear the music in the recording and this is the only one of his with the right kind of groove . i would buy this album again if i saw him live again .
0	this song is amazing .
0	: i am a very happy person to hear this song .
1	i like this song . this is one of the only time i have ever liked a single song on a cd . it is a really happy song .
1	i love this speaker . i have bought two of them and i am very happy with them . the only negative i can think of is the size , i do not think it is a problem since i am not using the speaker in the bedroom but would not mind the size .
0	i am not a fan of skyliners , but i like this album a lot . the song are great and the vocal is great . the album is really good .
1	music is great . i have always liked the killer and always will . i remember the first time i heard the song island . it wa soooo beautiful and awesome and it just stuck with me . i have always loved the music of the killer and i just bought the new album , the killer i wa thinking about this album for a while and finally listened to it . it is by far one of the best album i have ever heard . the music is soo deep and amazing with every song . and the lyric are soo deep and amazing . and the music video they put together for the song are soo beautiful and awesome . i have always loved the killer music . it is soo beautiful and awesome . i have never heard them live but i read that they do a good job live . i am totally in love with their music and their music video . i can not wait to see them live . they are soo good . i have always loved the killer and they will always be my favorite band . and i will always be in love with the music they put out . thanks for listening . i will be back . i love you . : ) _
1	i have listened to this twice and find it to be great , a lot better than the original version .
1	this song really touched me .
1	i love the frosty the snowman song . i sing it all the time . this is a great christmas song that i love to sing .
1	i am always a little curious about new stuff i hear in the radio , and this is no exception . the first thing i noticed is that they changed the song to not be a parody of the movie and instead to be a song about a person in love . i love that they did this , because it is a very subtle and clever change . also , i love that they put the lyric i am always a little curious in bold . i love it and think it is one of my favorite from the album . it is a little different in sound than the other song on this album , but it is still pretty good . it is a great addition to the album , and i definitely recommend it .
1	this album is a wonderful album , especially for me , i have been listening to gospel music for my whole life and i love this album .
0	absolutely horrible pressing . save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster . i got this on a daily deal , but even at that price , it wasnt worth it . sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range . the bass is nonexistent , and wa quieter than most of my other record . i have listened to it about 3 time now , just to see if it needed to break in a bit . nope ! just horrible .
1	i have never seen this in theater , but it is very good ! i give this a 4/5 .
1	this is the best version of the song . it is a perfect match and is a wonderful rendition of the song .
1	i love it . thanks . the cd arrived on time and wa a described
0	wow . i wa hoping for more like his first 2 album and wa severely disappointed . nirvana . really ? not great listening .
0	i wanted pg version , the one i bought had too much cussing in it
0	i bought this album because i love the music . i wa disappointed . the only good thing about this album is that it is a novelty song .
0	the soundtrack of this movie is great and it is a good movie . i wish the film had a better soundtrack .
0	i love this cd ! it is a great cd . it is a great album . it is a great concept . i love this album . i would recommend it to anyone , regardless of age , gender , or musical taste .
0	this album just did not do it for me . i got it when it came out , because i have all their cd and love them to death . it is too girly and poppy for me , high-pitched . the lyric are not all that clear , and do not mesh well together to mean one thing . most of all , the melody of the song are hard to listen to . you know how some song are just . difficult for the ear to enjoy ? these song are fine most of the time . but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody ( or the singing ) is difficult to listen to .
1	this is a good song . i really like the lyric . it is a good song .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard .
1	i do not know why i did not tell you how i felt about this song before , but i love it ! it is like the beat is just going out of your head . the song is great and the lyric are just fantastic .
1	this group is awesome and my daughter love it . i have bought this group and my son love it .
0	i think this is an amazing album . the lyric are beautiful . the music is very good . i do think that desrosiers is a very talented person . i think that she should get the chance to make a full-length album of her own . this is not a bad album at all . it just is not a wonderful album . it is not a very good album . i think that if you bought this album , that you would have to listen to it over and over again . the song are very deep and the music is very good . i think that desrosiers should get the chance to write her own little house book .
1	the first time i heard this song , it wa during a time where i wa sad almost every day . thing were not looking good for me . but the song , the lyric spoke to me and helped me to cheer up . very inspirational for me .
1	wow . this is really great . the acoustic guitar playing on all apology is incredible . i will be your mirror also ha some great guitar work . stoned is really good , and breed is great . spank thru is my favorite song of all of nirvana .
0	it is hard to be a fan of a band that doe not try hard to get a decent sound . i understand why the band is trying to get a decent sound and i am glad they are doing that but i just do not like it when the band make it sound like they are trying too hard . this band ha been trying to sound like it is on the verge of a great breakthrough for year and i just do not like it .
0	a great record !
1	i wa at this show with my mom . we enjoyed the show . the singer , jeff , wa great . he wa very kind . we were surprised that we could come back and listen to the same song . i would recommend this show to anyone .
1	this is one of my favorite stryper album . the song are great and the guitar riff are very cool .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .
1	it is kind of the theme of this album ; i mean , it is a tribute to the old country music that lucinda ha been making for so many year !
1	! i bought this cd for my wife . she is a whitney fan and this cd will make her a whitney fan again . she love her voice so much . she ha seen this cd before and always ha been disappointed . i decided to give her the chance to hear this cd and i wa not disappointed . she is now a whitney fan and love her voice . this is the only cd she will buy .
0	i listened to this song multiple time . i do not think i have heard it before . i had to look up the lyric to find out what it wa about , but i liked it a lot . i also like the music . i like it a lot . but , i am not a fan of the word . there are a few in the song that i do not like . and i have to agree with the sentiment that this is not my kind of song .
0	i have listened to this album more than any other planetshakers album . i love this song .
0	these guy are not bad . they just are not very good . i do not know how to describe it , but their version of the i love rock n roll theme song is completely boring and is better listened to than this album .
1	it is a great song to end the summer . it is a very happy song and i like to listen to it during the summer time .
0	this cd is a great christmas album . the album start off with i believe in jesus . but after the first song , it becomes very boring . there are some good song in this album , but the entire album is very boring . the song are very repetitive .
0	i think there is a better version out there somewhere , but i love this one : )
0	this a good version of the song , very catchy . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . the drum are not needed . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio . the vocal are great . the vocal are good .
0	i have to agree with the above reviewer , i did not like this song very much . it ha a good beat , but it is just not my cup of tea .
0	sounded like a mexican band ; not country ; not my style . every song sounded the same ; no variety . if you are looking for country , this is not for you .
0	thought i wa downloading the original version . very disappointed .
0	i enjoy the jazz flavor of this album , but the lyric are too much for me , and the music is very uninteresting
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
1	this is the only song on the album i am not sure if i will like . i have listened to it a lot and my personal opinion is that it is not my favorite song .
1	this cd is great . the lyric and the vocalist are great
1	i purchased this song because i love it and had to have it . i did not buy it just to listen to it , or to be able to download it . i bought it to listen to it . the song is beautiful , and is one of my favorite . i have had the opportunity to play this song at a concert because i love it so much and it wa such a great experience .
1	i have a son that is four and he love this collection . it ha helped him tremendously . he is very good at playing these song too . this is a great collection for boy and girl .
0	this cd is a must have for any david gilmore collector . i have listened to this album and found many enjoyable song . i have also made some suggestion for other song that would make a good addition to the album .
1	very good .
0	i wanted the song so bad that i also ordered the re-mix but did not know that it wa the album . i don ; t have a turntable to play it on . i have no use for it .
0	
0	this is a classic ( or at least one of the best ) natalie song . i love it because it is a great song , and it is a great album . it is just so sad . it is so sad that the last time i saw natalie wa at her show in houston , and i wish she had a good tour going . it is a little sad that the last time i saw her wa at the houston concert . it is sad she is no longer with u , and it is sad she could not come to the show . all i can say is that this song is amazing .
0	what the hell are they thinking ?
0	i have enjoyed this album so far . the song are very enjoyable .
0	the only thing i do not like about this song is when the guy sings about dying for you in the middle of the song . i do not like that .

1	i am a big fan of this artist . i love the fact that this artist is very creative and the song he writes are original . i wish this artist would record more album . because of the fact that he is very creative , i wish he would record more album .
1	i bought this album for my son to give him some new music to listen to a he get older . what i have received is music that will send him into a deep sleep a he fall asleep . it is music that can make a person feel good and it is music that would bring out a smile from anyone that listens to it . i do not know how to explain this music . it just make me feel happy .
0	oh well , these guy are pretty much like the other indie band , you can not get much more indie ( or at least a lot of them are not on any major label ) , there is no way to be more indie , and there is no way to make the music sound better than it doe without being , well , indie . in a sense i like it , because it is just the same old song over and over with a different singer every time , but i would rather listen to the original band that recorded these song than anything else .
0	did not like this album . totally hated la llave de mi corazon it sounded like the song you would hear on a burger king commercial . why add the english lyric ? there is no need for it . i am totally disappointed and deleting from my ipod . get all of his previous material , because it is really world class .
0	
1	lyric are really good , but the vocal are a little too soft for me .
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song , but it wasnt the same version a in the video . i deleted it .

1	this is my pick if you need a song to get you started on a long road trip to fight vampire , demon and werewolf .
0	this song is one of the best in the game . the only real negative to say is that the song is not made up enough and it ha too much of the same theme . the song is actually really catchy , but just doe not have the wow factor of the other song .
0	i wa very excited to see the psycho soundtrack come out , but i wa disappointed to find it wa a complete mess . i do not usually get music that is bad , but this soundtrack wa just horrible . i thought it wa a terrible idea for a soundtrack to a film that is so well loved and is a classic . i will never buy this music because of how bad it is , and i am sure it will fall apart in a few year .
0	not bad . not bad .
0	i really like the song alligator . i listened to it three time , and each time i would listen to it over and over again , it grew on me a little bit . the song is one of my favorite song , but to be honest . this is a good album but not one i would listen to for hour at a time . my favorite song is black tie white noise .

0	i like the new jewel , but this album is so overproduced .
1	i hated their voice at first , and i hated the lyric . but i listened to the whole thing twice , and it actually is kinda catchy . but everyone is different . for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear .
1	this video is great . the band and the song are great . the song is a great song , but i wish they would have done a shorter version . i think they should have done a more upbeat version , like they did in the simpson .

0	nice cd .
0	this cd is awesome .
0	like most album of lou reed , this is not a bad album , but i do not think it is his best . the music is quite good , but i just do not love it . it ha a cool sound , but i do not think it is lou reed best .
1	i think this is one of the best song ever . i like the lyric . it is a nice song . it is a mellow rock song . i like the voice and the backing vocalist is good .

0	this ha been done many time and is a great rendition .
0	i downloaded this album to take to my friend house to listen to it . i have heard it on a cd , and i know the quality is low . the only reason i would say it is good is that it is from a new studio . i wish they would release a dvd or something to go along with it . i would be happy to pay for it . the song just are not that good . i just do not care for it . i like it when band go the extra mile . i do not know why people listen to this music . it is a waste of time for me . just listen to the album and make up your own mind .

1	i love the song , but i feel like all the instrument in the song are a bit underdeveloped and the drummer is playing too much . but , i love the song so i am keeping it .

0	_ ( the woman ) _ ( a man ) _ ( someone ) _ ( who know ? a woman ) _ ( a man ) _ ( somebody ) _ ( the man )
0	i would not buy this album . there is a track missing and the new dubbs in the speaking part are terrible !
0	i downloaded this and it start over in the middle of the download a bad one this one and it still cost me so watch when getting this song !
0	i think prince is very underrated and ha a lot to offer . he ha a very unique sound and is very creative . but , his music is not up to par with his other album from this era . i would rather listen to prince lovesexy than his new album .
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway .
0	she can not even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater . i would suggest you get the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes . there are some great thing .
1	i love the melody of this song ! i think this is a great and happy song . i really like to listen to this song in the summertime .
1	a good attempt to create a song using the the wizard of oz theme . it is a tad simplistic , but still ha a certain cinderella feel to it . wouldve been nice to hear a bit more story and le glee reference .
0	this is the best song i have ever heard .
1	i sing this song , let it go every night before i go to bed , and i always sing it to my child before
1	i like this cd . i like this cd . i love this cd . i like this cd . i love this cd . i love this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd . i love this cd
0	this song is so bad . i wish i could forget that song .
0	- i am not a lover of this music , but i thought it wa good . - i will give this album a try . - i do enjoy listening to these other artist music , so i would probably listen to this one .
1	i wa floored .
0	the two song i really wanted to hear are not on it ; what a waste of money ; is the other music good ? sure , but the missing song make it a big disappointment .
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording . the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell . who doe not like sleigh bell ? i like it !
1	i am a big fan of cher , and i love this song . it seems to always be a hit for her . i would give it a 3 star review because of the over all mediocre song .
1	fun and very creative album .
1	this album is amazing . i have been a tough sell lately on new music - especially on first listen throughs . but i wa instantly hooked . if you like zaba , you will like this . it is different , but in a good way .
1	this cd is a perfect selection for a christmas present . i have bought it for myself and for my kid . they absolutely love the song .
1	this song rock !
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film . i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day .
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement , this 2cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression - both explosive and contemplative . i love it !
1	the randy bachman album that had the greatest impact on me were thicker than thief and the randy bachman album . the former is the one that ha to be purchased first since it is
1	this is a great album . i will buy it again . this is why i like the cd . the cd are much better . now i can listen to all the song on a cd .
0	this song would have let u play the song exceptoon .
0	i picked up this cd at an estate sale . i wasnt expecting much and thought it would be a simple cd that i could put in my player and that i could not be bothered to take anything out of except for a picture and song lyric . i wa very wrong . i am a big fan of this artist , and wa hoping this cd would be a nice addition to my collection , and i wa so wrong . this cd wa one of the most beautiful cd i have ever heard , but it came out sounding like crap . the only good thing about this cd wa that it wa a gift from my best friend who is a fan of this artist . i am disappointed in this cd and i would like to hear more by this artist .
1	i am a big fan of this band . this album is excellent .
1	i do not know how to describe this album . it is so great i can not even describe it . it an amazing album . i do not know why i have not listened to this album for a very long time . i have been waiting and it is finally here .
1	who rock harder than nickelback ? i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe come on . so now i use it a a ringtone for my android phone .
0	this is one of the best rock album ever produced . it is not what you would call rock , but it definitely a rock album . you can not help but get into their music . this album ha song that sound like the real thing - like a hard rock band . it ha a great mix of new and old song - with a few classic thrown in . this album ha a rock sound , but it is definitely not anything close to a rock sound .
0	this song really is not my favorite , but i really enjoy it . it get good review from other reviewer .
0	i can not understand why bob dylan popularity ha reached such a high level . i listen to a lot of his material , but i do not understand why he is such a big star . he is not really a great singer or an outstanding musician .
0	great song !
0	a very nice , but not very exciting , cd . i can be selective about which song i listen to . i know that in the past , i have never listened to the entire cd in one sitting . i like the vocal , but the song are not too interesting either .
1	this wa a good song . i liked the song . i like the song on this album .
1	i will buy the cd when it is released . i have been listening to this cd for several month and i still love it . i would recommend it to anyone . the cd is very good . i have listened to it for a month and i still like it . it is good . i would recommend it to everyone .
0	i really like the first half of this album , but the second half is a joke . my wife and i listened to this last night and we decided to stop after the first song . the song selection is poor and the lyric are really annoying . the only reason i gave this record an 8 is because the cover ha a picture of two woman in an orgy in a field in the background . the album cover is also the only redeeming feature .
1	i love this song . i think it is very catchy . i think it is kind of funny . i do not know . i wa really tired . i just kind of put it on .
1	this song ha a great beat and it make you want to dance .
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining .
0	i just wanted to say how much i enjoy this song . the vocal are great and it is a song that i will never forget . i hope to see the replacement play live someday .
1	this is one of the best sleep music i have found . if you like slow song , you will love this one . it is simple and perfect for falling asleep .
0	i agree that this song is a generic song . however , it is a catchy song and i can not help but listen to it .
0	so , when you have heard it all already , i guess you are just bored with all the christmas music you have been listening to . this is a great album .
1	fantastic ! possibly his best album yet
1	*
0	ken vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year old who run around screaming , kenny , are full of it . this album is anything but what i expected from the band . if you want a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime and i will show you some tape i have of them playing local show around here . you know , before they sucked . ok , so they do not suck , but they were far better before they released this cd . stay underground with song like gregs last day and the original leaving .
1	i really like this song ! it wa my favorite song of the year !
0	i am a big fan of this band . this song wa not what i expected nor what i paid for . i bought this song because it wa a complete song and had a great lyric . it wa not what i had hoped for . i am not a fan of the music . i love the music and thought they were great people but this wa not what i expected from them . i have purchased song from them and i have received great song . i am still looking for the real deal . i am disappointed and i will wait for a real deal . i am disappointed and i will wait for a real one . i will not buy the cd again .
0	! ( a song by the band ! ) !
0	this album ha a lot of good song , but the producer , jackyl and his team are not doing an adequate job of producing an original album . there are no real track on the album . the album is full of filler and the song are average at best .
0	i actually really like this album . it is very good . the song are just so catchy . it is a great blend of old and new . i have never heard the album in it entirety , but it is from what i have heard it sound like it could be a great album . i wish there wa a better sound quality . i bought this cd so i could listen to it on my car stereo , but i can not listen to it on my car stereo . i can not even listen to it on my computer . it is just too bad that it sound so horrible .
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard . a must for those who collect this type music .
1	i purchased this album and have listened to it many time . i always enjoy it . the song and the music are wonderful . the cd is well produced and the sound quality is very good . and the cd is well written .
1	sometimes you really have to love a song before you can listen to it . this is one of those time .
0	this is definitely one of the best album of all time .
0	i purchased this speaker to use in my living room . i am not impressed at all . i can not get the surround sound effect that i am used to . the speaker are very loud , but i am not impressed with there sound quality , there is a lot of distortion in the music . it is like they are singing themselves .
0	i have always admired kiss a a band and their music . i am not a huge fan of this cover of rock and roll all nite . it is just a boring version . the kiss version is better .
0	i have listened to this cd a lot , i love her music and this is a good cd , it is very good but the cd is only 4 song long so i dont really know what to say . i like her new cd , but i dont think this cd is good because it is the same 4 song over and over , i think this cd ha a great song but a bad cd . i think it is good but not a good a her other cd . i like her other cd because they are a little different from the others , but this cd is the same 4 song over and over again
1	this is so much better than the other cd i have listened to .
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the 1997 film a good a it get , you make me wan na be a better man , this song embodies what a woman want in a relationship . from the opening note , you will be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day . although this song is not written by gibson himself , it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your ear drum .
1	i have never heard the whole album , but i love it . it reminds me of my childhood . the song are very catchy , and i love how they sound . i think this album is great and i will probably listen to it every day .
0	this is a very nice song , although i wish it wa a little longer . this song is nice , but it is just a little too long . i wish it had a little more energy and a little more energy . the song is not bad , but it is just a little too long . i wish it would go away .
1	there is no other way to say this song is a real winner . it is one of my favorite . i loved the way the band performed the song , and the way the band chose their part . i have been a fan since the first time i heard the song . i have listened to this song over 150 time .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
0	the worst album i ever purchased wa nevermind . i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fan recommended it so highly . but i am sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down . it is hard to listen to more than 3 song at one go ! i found the album to be monotonous & boring . the song are very bad and the vocal are awful .
1	this is simply the best song of the album . it is a little bit like the best song of the album . there are not many song that can be said to be better than this .
1	this song is great . i bought it after i bought the new album . i love this song .
0	this is a really interesting album . it is enjoyable to listen to on the drive to work and then to relax with after a long day . it is a good mix of good song with some really good one . the instrumentation is simple yet very effective . the song are well sung and the subject matter is mostly of interest . the guitar playing is very good and the bass playing is well done . the production is very good too . the album will appeal to those who like their rock and roll music like the classic rock of the 1960s .
0	i have never heard of this band before . however , i have heard the song i am too sexy on the radio and thought it wa a good song . i had never heard of this band before , but i am glad i listened to it . i like this song and the album .
0	i listened to this song for the first time on the radio today . it wa horrible . i am so glad i did not listen to it for the first time on the radio today . i am glad i wa able to get rid of it on my cd player . i did not think my cd player could play anything and this song wa so horrible i just wanted to throw it away . i do not know what to do with this horrible song . it will not play on my radio anymore . i have had to keep it on my computer or it will be played on the radio . it is so bad and horrible it make me want to call my mom and tell her to get a gun and kill herself . i am tired of her complaining about cd . she is buying way too much of them . she is going to kill herself by the way . this is the worst song i have ever heard on the radio .
1	this is a christmas cd , but not christmas music . a very pleasant surprise .
0	a good tune , but it is another remake of another song .
0	the first of our favorite christmas song . we like this one because it is so simple and the word are so simple and the melody is simple . you can hear the chorus in the background . they sing it at their christmas eve dinner . we sing it at our christmas eve dinner , we sing it to the guest at our christmas eve dinner , we sing it at the christmas dinner , we sing it to the guest at our christmas dinner , we sing it at our christmas dinner , we sing it to our christmas dinner . they sing it to the guest at our christmas dinner . i like the background of the song . it is a wonderful song . it is a wonderful christmas carol . it is a wonderful song . it is very good .
0	great album by sinatra . the song are great , but the cover is awful . i have to admit that i did not like the music , but the cover wa good .
0	what a nice song ! what a nice song !
1	this is a fantastic cd . i bought it to help me remember all the cool music i liked when i wa a kid . it is perfect . the album ha a great mix of song , and the song are short , which make it more fun to listen to and also help you get the point of the album faster .
1	i love the song , i love the music , i love the singing style , i love ke $ ha , i love her music , i love her dancing , i love her personality .
1	i downloaded the song a fast a i could . i had to do a few thing to get them to work . first , i had to open up the ipod on my computer and then i had to put them on shuffle and then i had to sync them to my ipod . i would have been happy to wait the hour it took to download them on the ipod , but then i realized that i had to put them on shuffle and sync them to my ipod . i did not have my ipod on shuffle and i wa having trouble synching my ipod to my computer . so , i played some of the song on shuffle , but wa not able to put the song on shuffle until i made sure that my ipod wa on shuffle . i wa just in the middle of playing some of the song when i got the error that my ipod wa not on shuffle . i thought maybe i wa the only person who had to do all of this . i wa really excited to listen to it on my ipod , but i had to do a few thing . i would have been happy to listen to it on shuffle , but then i realized that i had to put it on shuffle and sync it to my ipod . i had to do a few thing to get them to work . i would have been happy to wait the hour it took to download the song on the ipad , but then i realized that i had to put them on shuffle and synch them to my ipod . i wa just in the middle of playing some of the song when the error message came up . i thought maybe i wa the only person who had to do all this . i wa really excited to listen to it on my ipod . i do like song on my ipod with my headphone on , but i guess i have to have them on shuffle so that i can hear the song better . i do not have a problem with listening to them on shuffle or synching them to my ipod .
1	i do not think you can listen to this cd without buying it . it is a terrific christmas cd . i do not know why the other reviewer are negative . the cd is worth every penny .
1	use to deliver morning newspaper listening to this on tape .
0	i have never been so disappointed in a record in my life . the song is a waste of time , and worse , it is just not worth the money it cost .
0	take some no-doze before you listen to this one .
0	i wish i could turn back time . this song ha been covered many time and i think they were attempting to have a few song on this album that were not hit and get some money out of it . they do not come close to the original .
1	this rendition is very close to the original . it is just very close . it is okay .
0	i am not a fan of this album , but i am not a fan of a lot of album either . it is really quite good , i like it . i do not like how it is put together . it wa a great album , but it wasnt meant to be this way .
0	i thought this wa a pretty good song but i did not like the song satisfied . the only other good thing i can say about this one is that it is not a bad song .
0	excellent presentation , but it is the worst floyd album ever ! they should regret to had produced it .
1	this is not a very good cd . the only thing i like about this cd is the name of the album . i will probably buy this cd , because i do not know what else i can get to listen to . i will probably never buy another cd from amazon again . i had a very good experience with this cd , but i can not imagine that anyone else will enjoy it . at least i can say that i now have no more cd to return . i have an extremely good experience with this cd . i have not experienced an even better experience with any other cd that i have ever ordered on amazon .
1	this wa purchased for christmas . i am getting it for christmas . this is probably going to be the first cd i buy on cd when we go to christmas with my parent .
1	i really like this album . it is a good mix of the band most recent and classic song . it ha a lot of energy . i like how every song ha a hook or a catch phrase or a catchy chorus . there is one song i do not like , the light at the end of the tunnel because it is very slow . it is also one of the slower song on the album . however , i still like it . i recommend this album to anyone who like pop-rock/metal with some of the pop in it . it is a good album .
0	i bought a few record from this guy that i loved . but , i stopped listening to him . i have been collecting record for about 15 year , and i love listening to music . this cd is not music . it is the work of a good guy , but i will not listen to it . i am not a fan of his music .
0	i am not a fan of this band , they are just . i do not know . i can not really say that i like them . i like the original version .
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
1	if you like the song , buy it .
0	aint nothing like 2 crackheads in love brings back memory doe not it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug .
0	i bought a new mp3 and i wa excited to find out that it wa a christmas song . i wa so happy to find out that it wa a christmas song . i really liked the song and i hope it will go on and on .
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
1	this song and the song i do not mind are both very beautiful .
1	this is my second country album . i enjoyed my first album , but the song just did not grab me the way this one did . this album ha some great song , but it is definitely not my favorite .
1	i do not have a lot of time to listen to music
1	i have been a deadhead since high school . i think the best place i have seen them live wa in the spring of 83 at the palladium in los angeles . i wa hooked immediately and have seen them live many time since then .
0	this album is great . it is a complete waste of time . i could listen to this album all day . i could listen to it all night . i could listen to it forever . but i will never listen to it again . it is just a complete waste of time .
0	this song doe not really move me . i have a hard time listening to it .
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp3 . after i paid for it , it will only let me listen to it through amazon . that doe me no good . i want the mp3 that i paid for .
1	great album , great voice , but this album is like 3-4 song and it sound like shit .
1	got this song in my head after watching true detective on tv , so i had to buy it !
1	the first album that paul mccartney wrote in response to queen we are the champion is both the most beautiful and the most haunting of his four-album career .
1	this cd ha been a great help for my husband and me . my husband wa a little nervous going away for the first time on a cruise with me . i wa able to sleep through the night while he wa away . i have listened to this cd many time and it ha been a great help . i highly recommend this cd to anyone who ha a sick family member .
0	this cd is not worth the money . it is a collection of mostly forgotten song from the oldie and classic of the early 1970s . the song are mostly good , but there are two or three song that are completely meaningless to me .
1	i bought this album and have been listening to it non stop since . i love reed music but this is the only one of his with the right kind of groove .
0	i love it . beautiful , worshipful , and meaningful .
1	i am sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest , but this one doe the trick for me . i have been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking . tom version of jersey girl ( the original ) can not be beat . the heart of saturday night ? nothing really need to be said . if you want to try tom wait on for size , starting here is not a bad idea . great stuff .
0	this is a horrible record . thulian is just a douche and a fraud . the music is bad , the voice are bad , and the story is bad . there is no story . the music is just a cover band for an 80 cover band . listen to at least two song with a better quality track , like the grinch song , a christmas carol , and do the right thing . then listen to the rest of the song .
0	the album open with a lovely little pop song about a girl who like to wear white . then the song go into space on the song âluminousâ . there are several other song that sound like they might be about alien .
1	i bought it because i wanted a cd with every song on it .
0	this is a good album . not a good a i thought it would be .
1	i love this song ! it is a great song .
1	i have only bought this cd a few time , and always felt that the cd wa worth it . it is very relaxing and very musical . the cd is well made . the song are very good . i would definitely buy this cd again .
0	flower are a great band , but they have always had the same sound with their first album . they are not trying to change their sound , but they are trying to change the sound . their new song are great , but so are their last one . i love the sound of their song , but i just do not feel like listening to their music anymore . it is like they are trying to push themselves into unchartered territory , but they are doing it really poorly . they do not have the talent to do it right , so they just make the song sound like garbage . i do not feel like i am missing out on something good , because the only thing that i am missing out on is an album that is better than their first one . i do not know what to do with my life when i feel like this .
0	this a good album . the song are very well written . the message is good . the production is good . the song are very good . the lyric are very well written . i would recommend this album to everyone .
1	this song can be danced to many different way and to many different people . it can be danced to many different way and to various people and to many different people . it is a great song to dance to . it can be danced to many different way and to various people . i like this song . it is a great song to dance to . it is a great song to listen to . it is a great song to listen to . it can be danced to many different way and to various and to various people . it is a great song to dance to but it is not a great song . it is a great song to listen to but it is not a great song .

1	i have been using this album for a couple of week now and i absolutely love it . my wife love this album and i have been listening to it a lot recently .
1	these guy are awesome . they play fun stuff . i just wish there were more song on here to listen to but i will take what i can get .
0	i would buy this cd again if it did not have this line at the beginning .
0	this album sucked .
0	i really like this one but it is a little boring for me . i would recommend this album to people who like david soul music .
0	this is the first album from a band that i have had in the past three year . when i saw their name on the cover i wa really excited to listen to their music . this album is very different from the other album that i have heard in that it is not a much screaming and screaming a it is guitar and drum . it is more of a mix of old and new rock . i liked the guitar riff and the drumming . i did not like the vocal a much . i think the vocal made it sound like it wa made by a group of kid . the guitar riff and drumming were great . it wa a great mix of rock and roll . the vocal were great , but i did not like the screaming that came with the screaming , so i did not like the album .
1	this cd is one of the best album of 2009. the song are very well done , and the production is excellent . it is a must have for any music lover !
0	! this is the worst cd i have ever heard , i hate this cd
0	i have not liked this album since the first one .
0	i found this song really creepy . i do not know what kind of song is this .
0	this is one of my favorite album of all time , especially the first disc . the first disc ( india newest music ) is an absolute blast . but the second disc ( india newest music # 2 ) is just plain boring . there is really no point to any of the song on the second disc because they are not that good . the song that are included in the second disc are i am on the board and falling . i am on the board is nothing special and her vocal are not that great on it . falling is just a sad song about not being able to do anything because of her husband illness . it really make me sad . it is such a heart-wrenching sad song . and it would be kind of funny if she went on to write another song like that . it is kind of sad . i really do not know how a 5 year old can write lyric like that . i really do not like falling . it sound like it couldve been written by a 5 year old . i do not know why she had to write such a sad song . i do not know why she had to write such a sad and depressing song . and it hurt my heart to think that a 5 year old really could write a song like that . i really do not know how she could write such a sad song . the other three song are just dull . they are not that good either . i do not think i will ever listen to her again . i guess i just do not like her anymore . i do not like her music anymore . i guess i just do not like her anymore .
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement , this 2cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression - both explosive and contemplative . i love it !
1	i found this song from the internet . it is a great song to listen to when you are bored .
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .

0	this a great album . it is a great album and ha a wide appeal . it is a great concept but when you realize how good the music is , it is a great concept that delivers on it promise .

1	i bought the song for my girlfriend . it can go on and on .
0	the cd is not a good a the cd in the movie .
0	i do not understand , how serious yes fan can consider this fly from here to be a real yes album . step back to the real world , dude : this is nothing else than an album that could be better titled a drama , vol 2. but this time , the performing band name is maybe . . hey , but . what can you really expect when there is no more jon anderson and rick ( or even his so-talented son adam ) wakeman , back in the full gang ? in addition , trevor horn ha buggles-ed the music once again .
1	i really like what they did with this song . it ha a wonderful melody . i hope you will have many more to play . thank you ! i love you !
0	no plot synopsis or any information about the production included .
1	this cd is great

0	this is one of those album that is like a breath of fresh air to the music world . while i do not usually listen to this genre it is a welcome change of pace for me to listen to something different . this album is a very talented group of musician and it is well produced and arranged .

1	wow . i had no idea what i wa listening to . this is by far the best song on the whole album . i love the lyric and i totally get all the word . i love the voice . it reminds me of the voice of my son when he wa born . this song is a great song for a christian mother to sing and a christian father to cry to . i love the sound of the song .
1	
0	i am usually a fan of song that tell the story of the love of a man and a woman . after listening to this one , i have to admit that i do not see the point in it . it just feel like a couple of people putting on a show and telling the story . the first half is fine , and the second half doe not cut it . in fact , the second half is worse than the first . the last half is one of the worst song i have ever heard . the vocal are not even close to good . i do not know if i would recommend this one to anyone .
1	i think the best thing about this disc is that it is a lot of fun to listen to . it is a great way to spend a saturday night . this album is a lot of fun . great song , great band , great musician !
0	it is an okay song , but the whole reason i downloaded it , wa i wa looking for a kelli glover song . maybe she is in the background , but not worth the $ .99 . sorry folk . i wish kelli would put up a website and let u download some song of hers . she can sing .
1	the first album of k. wa a great album . this is definitely a better album . the beat are really good and the melody are great . the lyric are terrible , but the beat is really good and is extremely catchy . i would recommend this album to anyone that like rap music .

1	another great album from a great band . the song this side is one of my favorite of all time .
1	there are so many people out there who should be proud to be able to have this song on their playlist . it is a great song , and i would encourage anyone who listens to it to do the same . the only thing i would have liked to see is a little more context for the lyric , though .
0	doe a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician ? i thought not , so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend . if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be-all , end-all of the music scene , it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago . this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world . look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music .
0	- this is not a bad album . - i will buy it .
1	this is a very moving song . i am sure the troop are very grateful for this song .
0	radiohead is my favorite band .

1	the lyric to this song are very good , especially the part in the beginning .
0	not the version i knew or wanted . did not know that before purchase ! wa not given possibility to see that it wa a different version . did not say remix when purchased .

1	the song i believe in you is one of my favorite song . i love the lyric and the way it is sung by the artist . i think that the song is a real good song .
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl . that might be true , but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with . there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song . not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album . they all are a mediocre at best rating . nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of .
0	i love this song . it is so good and i think i hear the best part in it . the way the vocal are done is just so beautiful . i love it . it is one of my favorite . thank you for sharing your music .

0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind .
0	i would buy this cd again . i just purchased another copy of it for my son . i have sung along to it a few time . it is pretty good .
1	i have a cd with this song it is so beautiful and she is so good at singing this song and the singer is her . i love her voice she ha the best voice ever and it a good song it is a great song it is so beautiful and i like the chorus she sings it is so good so i love this song

1	this album is a classic .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
0	this is a decent cd . i like the song on it . i do not like it . the song are not really memorable . the instrumentals are repetitive and the lyric are not very clever . other than that , i really like her other cd .
0	this is another one of the song we can sing with gusto , but the lyric and performance are too repetitive and the arrangement are not a good a the others on the album .
0	i really like this song .
1	this song is pretty sweet and i would love to hear more of this one . it reminds me of that old song that i used to listen to in the car when i wa a kid called i am your hoochie coochie . it ha the same beat and just the right amount of energy to make me feel good .
1	i had to go to the store and pay $ 15 for this cd . i bought it because it wa one of the few cd i had not heard of . i listen to it quite often .
1	this album rock !
1	this song is really great ! it ` s a good song !
1	ahmad jamal is one of the great pianist of our time , he is a remarkable talent . listen to him play this wonderful album for yourself .
0	i have 2 copy of this one . one wa sent to me and the other one wa on my phone . i dont know how someone could have sent me a different one .
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
0	depression is what you will slip into when attempting to listen to this comedy album
1	very good , simple and easy to listen to .
1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance . keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing .
1	this should be in the top ten of bluegrass album . this album is filled with good song , and there is an emphasis on the pure bluegrass sound . it is an all around nice album , and should be on every fan collection !
0	this is my favorite album from natalie . a collection of great song , but the lyric are too generic . they are not unique or specific to the singer herself . if you are looking for a natalie album that is completely different then this is not it . the song are great , but the lyric are generic .
0	i really like this and it make me laugh . i thought the vocal were very bad and i do not think the song wa very funny . i wa very disappointed .
1	i really like this album . i think it a very good album and it is a good album for a person who is looking for good song .
1	
0	this ha to be the most overrated album ever . the only thing i like about it is that i do not even know what side a is . i am not even sure if there is an a or b side . the only thing that i do like about this album is that it contains the most famous dylan song in history , like a rolling stone . the only song i like is when i wa a boy . this is a boring piece of work .
1	a beautiful little song . i would like to see it played again . thank you . you can listen to it at http : / www.starpower.org/powerpoint/womens-catholic-radio-station/womens-catholic-radio-station-music/womens-catholic-radio-station-music-5.html
1	i have been hearing about this band since i wa a kid . i have been a huge fan of this band . i have been looking forward to this album for
1	i hope this doe not get passed on to other people . i really hope it doe not . it is a terrible piece of garbage . like the cover-up to the real story of the grinch . it is just a joke . i do not have time to listen to it , and i do not want to . i would rather listen to the original how the grinch stole christmas .
0	i enjoy listening to this cd . the song are a little different from the other cd i have bought . this cd is worth buying . i will continue to buy this cd .
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
0	this is a great album .
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard . i really do not like that song .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	i love this song
1	i purchased this one a soon a i saw it . i like
0	the book think & grow rich is a must own . it is book to be read multiple time . that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone . he doe not pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph . you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second . the narrator ha a strong voice it is just emotionless . it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud . but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming .
0	if you like the beatles then this is for you . this cd ha all of the single and album from the beatles and is a very good compilation . i have to give it 5 star .
1	i love this album . the lyric are great !
0	my favrit josh groban ever . i play it every few day . wish he would do more showtunes and le opera
1	i like that the guitar sound in the background rather than out front , but it is still a good song .
0	alright , this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review . it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a 5 year old most likely did . the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know ! that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first 3 time . the final you do not know ! end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer . do not throw away your money , and if it is on the radio change the station !
0	my mother and i absolutely love josh groban and this song . but we were very disappointed when it only played the first verse and the chorus like five more time . very disappointing rendition
0	this guy is really good ! this is the best band in the world ! very nice sound ! very good live ! i have had the opportunity to see them live ! i love them ! i think they are the greatest ! they have the best sound ! i love their music ! i love the band ! i love all their song ! i love all their song ! i love all their song ! i love all their song ! i love them ! i love them ! i love them ! i love their music ! i love their music ! i love them ! they are the greatest !
1	this album is a very good album . this album ha a very good mix of traditional and modern music . the album is very well done . the song on the album are very long and have a lot of depth . at the time , i wa not able to appreciate this album fully . i would recommend this album to someone who want a mix of traditional and modern music . i would recommend this album to someone who want variety in their music . i would recommend this album to someone who want variety in his music .
0	do not have much to say about this a this wa something i had not even ordered . no real word for this at all .
0	seriously another generic radio rock band that fall in the theory of a deaman my darkest day popevil buckcherry just straight up generic rock that sound like bon jovi meet nickelback that will be in roatation at rock station for the next 3 month then no one will remember who this band is seriously can we be a little more originally please !

0	this song wouldve been better without the cd .
1	it is pretty good . had it playing outside the front door halloween night . good mood maker .
0	this title is mangled - disco beat , sputtering word that are incomprehesible , then dead silence .
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound .
1	this is a very good album . tom is so talented . i just wish he would work on his singing and stop putting so much pressure on himself .
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake . checked artist copy and it is completely different

0	this song is good although it is lyric are terrible
0	the only thing i like about this album is that it ha a very good mix of old song with new song . the song on this album are great and they are all classic . i would not listen to this album too much a it will take me at least an hour to listen to it . i am not very familiar with this album because i have not heard it anywhere else .
1	what is the point of this song ? it is just a catchy tune and people will sing it .

0	this album is one of the worst christmas album i have ever heard . there are some very good song in this album , but the album is so bad , that i can not stand it . the album start off with i believe in jesus but after that , it becomes a very poor collection of song . it is basically a collection of christmas song with some christian influence , but they are not christmasy . there is no place like home is not very good .
0	in this day and age , there are a lot of band that are just trying to make a living . i think people can do a lot better with their money than this band is doing . what is the point in doing these hit if not to get people interested in your band ?

0	? - what the hell is that ! ? wtf is that ! ?
0	this album is good . it is a good album .
1	this song is so much more than i thought it would be . i wa expecting a song with a lot of string and a lot of chicken and a lot of honey and a lot of daddy and a lot of sweetheart and a lot of babe , and then a song with a lot of i love you and a lot of you and a lot of love you and a lot of i love you . i wa not expecting a song that really just say i love you and ha a couple of stanza about it . and i like i love you that much better , and i love the i love you that much more . i especially like the i love you that is so much longer than i expected it to be . i like the way it end . but what i like most is how he sings the i love you with a little bit of a drawl to it . it is very sweet .

1	this song rock !
0	this is one of the best beatles ever . these are good song and this album is well put together . i am very impressed with this album .
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english .

0	i bought this album because i love the name of the album , and i really love the song on it . i love the sound of the song , and i love the fact that they are all different and that they do not sound alike . it is a very good album , with many great song . i also purchased the cd because i know this is a very good album , and i know the song are very good , and i know that the album is very good . i do not know what is wrong with this guy . the album is a good album , with many good song . i do not know what is wrong with this guy . i just hope he doe not do any more album . i really do not believe that this album is very good . i do not know what is wrong with him . i do not know if he wa trying to make a name for himself , but he succeeded . i do not know what is wrong with him . i just really do not like the name of the album . the only good thing about the album is the fact that it is my first cd i ever bought . i really do not like the name of the album , and do not like the fact that it is my first cd i ever bought . the song are very good , but the album is very bad . i do not know what is wrong with this guy . it is a very good album , with many good song , but the album is very bad . i do not know what is wrong with this guy . i am just not a fan of the album . i do not know what is wrong with this guy , so if i ever meet him , i will just tell him , hey man , this is my first cd i ever bought , and i do not like the name of the album . because even if he doe make more album , it will not be my first , and i certainly will not be the first person to tell him that , so he will know that i know what is wrong with him .

1	the lyric to this song are a bit cheesy but this is a great song and the song writer is a talented lady .
1	ive started out with this cd , but then started listening to the cd control system , which is very good ! but i never got around to buying this cd because i always thought it wa too good to be true . then i went back to this cd , and found out that it wa .
0	this is the best jenny album that i have ever heard . it is the best version of the album that i have ever heard .
0	this is the worst album i have ever heard . it is a very bad album . the only good thing that come out of this is that they are still playing .
0	this is a collection of very good song . but the liner note give away the whole story . if you are just looking for a cd with a few good song , then this is not for you . if you are really a fan of metal and are looking for a compilation of some of the best song in all heavy metal genre , then this is a must have . i have a few people that have told me that this is the first time they have ever seen this album . if you have not heard this , then you need to !

0	/
0	when i first played this cd , i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez . then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following : all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group . not sure what this is supposed to mean , but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to . do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else .
1	i really like this song . i like this song a lot .
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
0	? - i would like to know what this one is .
1	this song is great and i love it , i love it ! this song is wonderful !
0	bought this cd for my son for his birthday . it wa worth it . he loved it . but i did not like it .
0	strong political view that are ranted about through the medium . refuse to listen to it a second time .
0	another one of the bad song that wa a complete mess . i hope that the next one is better .
0	misleading name- the name of this song should be changed . putting ( basement tape ) on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version . a real disappointment when looking for the popular version .
0	this is a waste of time and money . i do not care about pete rock . i do not listen to him all that much . i do not like what he doe , and i certainly do not like his music .
0	very poor album . there is a lacking of instrument , basic drum . very unsophisticated .
0	this song is so generic , i can not understand what a person would want out of it . i do not like the song , it is nothing special to my ear .
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad . i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock . however , you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record . my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old , but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level . it is like the speaker wa blown , very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music .
0	new song from my favorite artist .
0	the movie sound cool , but the music is not . i love the music , but this movie is just not that great . the story is good , but the music is not . this movie is like a roller coaster , but the music is the fast moving part .
1	
1	this album is great . not a great album , but a very very good album .
1	i think i am going to go out on a limb and recommend this song , and the movie , to my daughter when she want to watch this movie . maybe i will even let her watch it with me .
0	
0	it is a good song but it is not a spectacular song . this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music . i love gaga , but not this song
0	i have been listening to this album for the past two week , and i have really enjoyed it . i have not heard anything like it before . the guitar is really good and the musician are very talented . the music is very different from most folk music . the lyric are very interesting and there is a lot of variety in the song .
0	it is unfortunate that there is not a negative rating scale . the disc took five week to arrive . both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal , even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging . recycled the day it arrived .
1	these track have an acoustic part and a rock part . the acoustic part is really nice .
0	i would not recommend this to anyone .
0	i think it is a great song , but it doe not play through to the end before cutting off , so it doe not make it to the top 10 .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
1	i love this song and group ! it brings back memory of my youth . thanks for having this song for me to purchase .
0	i enjoy this album , but the song choice is boring . not even the blue .
0	i can not tell you how sorry i am that i have not seen this movie yet . it is so amazing . it is just so amazing ! i can not wait to see it !
1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever . the instrumentation is gorgeous . thom yorkes voice is at it best .
1	this is a book by an author named dan enchautegui . i have read it and it is a good read . i will probably read it again soon because it is good . this review is based on review from amazon . but i am not sure why you would want to buy a book that the author will probably never write again . this is the kind of book that will make you hate yourself and your family a well a the author . i will probably read it again soon because it is good .
0	i have all three cd . all three are very good . the burden is best . i would recommend these cd to anyone who love 70 music .

1	this is the second song on the album that is in a completely different key . i like it a lot , but i am not sure if it is worth the price of the album .
0	this song is a great song about the year end . it is a very repetitive song and it drag on a little too long . it is a great song , i love it !

1	he wa a hero in my eye . he wa a legend . he wa the man . he wa the king . i love him so much . his music ha always been my favorite . i have been listening to this album for a few month now and it ha grown on me . i thought it wa the best thing in year . i wa wrong . it is not even close to perfect . it is okay , but it is not great . there are a lot of rough spot . it should have been longer . the song are not long enough . they do not have the quality of the more recent al stewart album . there are a lot of weak spot . the lyric are weak . i could have listened to this for a year and not have realized it wa a bad album . i am glad i found this album . it is better than i expected it to be .

0	in general i dislike live recording , for two reason . in an actual concert , audience are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day . no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control - a if that wa the artist last word on the music . this is grossly unfair , and review rarely acknowledge the difference , but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work .
0	it is not a typical christmas song , but it is nice . the lyric are a bit creepy , but i am not really afraid of the lyric .

0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .

0	a nice arrangement of this song , with some nice addition of horn and string .
1	it would be nice to see some more new material that is not just live version of song . i do not mean to sound like a hater , but many of these song are just a couple of line . even the one with a few second of lyric . the other beatles song are more like song . at least this album ha some new song .

1	what can i say , i love this song . it is so catchy and ha a nice bass line .
0	do not . it doe not have vocal track in the mix . it is a straight-up repeating beat . when i previewed it , i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample . after all , it list all of the rapper in the artist column . wrong . wrong . i just spent a buck on half of this song . thanks a ton , whomever came up with this idea .

1	wont go wrong , and enjoyed every second of eric claptons music . other downloaded mp3 music lacked clarity . you will not regret getting/purchasing these music .
0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today . he is a cut above in the vocal department - he doe not need to do this . i am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career , with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock , where he shine , in my opinion . but , i adore him and his fearlessness . he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean it is not worthwhile .

1	i have to say that this is a very good album . the lyric are very clever . the music is well arranged . the lyric are very clever . but , some of the song would be better listened to in a small cafe or a coffee shop . although most of the song are excellent , i would put some song on a separate cd .

1	this is a fun song . if you like singing along to song , you will like this one . it is nice the way that the word are sung and it is not too much of a hard song to learn .
1	i like this version of the song . it is very smooth and sweet . the harmony is gentle and it lyric are thoughtful .
0	this song is fantastic ; it is a hit at least once a day on the radio and the tv ; but i can not figure out why it is so popular . i can not get it out of my head .
0	not a very good song , not even a good song . it is a little overrated .
0	i heard these song from the first album . all the song sounded great but the vocal were bad . it make me think these song were recorded in a studio . i liked the first album . the first album had good song . i like the first album . i like the first disc . i will buy the first disk . i bought the first album . i like the first album . i like the first disc . i will buy the first disk . i bought the first album . i do not think the second disc is a good a the first album . i do not think the second album is a good a the first album . i do not think the second disc is a good or a bad a the first disc . i do not think the second disc is a good or a bad a one of the first album . i do not think the second disc is a good or a the song on the first disk . i hope royce and the other member of crooked i are not going to be the next gang starr . i hope they do not leave crooked i. i am glad i bought the first disk . i am glad i bought the second disk . i bought the first album . i like the first album . i bought the first disk . it is a good cd . i will buy the second disc .

1	this song need to be played a lot more . it is a unique song and ha a great melody .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
0	oops , bought by mistake . do not waste your money
1	- i like this song and i think it is a great song .
0	i pre ordered this record , so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived . i wa all but kissed the delivery man when it came ! i ran straight up to my record machine and played it , probably around 3 time before giving poor dierks a break . i listened to the record about 5 time after that before the unthinkable happened . it is different for girl began to skip ! i wa in shamble ! on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite record it wa skipping !
0	i love the song i am on fire . i think this song is very good , but i really do not like i am on fire .
1	this cd ha so many good song , i am very glad i bought it .
1	this song is amazing . it explains how he refuse to live a life that is not holy and acceptable by god . this song is one of those who minister to both the saved and unsaved .
1	the band is new and i do not know much about them , except the name of the group . very well sung , and the music is excellent .
0	i have down loaded this two time . the song doe not work on my computer . i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon . they have refunded my money sometimes . but-why doe ten song down load & this one doe not !
1	i bought this song on a whim . this wa the only song on the radio that i could stand to hear because of the lyric . loved it . thanks for all the year you took to put this song on the chart .
1	it is a very good song . i like the lyric and the music . it is very good . i can also recommend this song .
0	i really like this cd . it is not bad . it is not great . it is not a very good cd . the song are all great , but the burden is the best . i own all three cd . i have all three cd in my collection . i do not know if i have the cd or not .
1	these guy have the best music podcast . very well produced and very informative .
0	i am a fan of country music , and this album is ok. it is not really great , but it is ok .
0	if you want a good rock album , with great vocal , and great lyric , pick up lifehouse . with a great band and a great album , it is easy to see why it took the world record for shortest time between album by a band that is only 4 people , to write and record an album in 4 day .
0	this cd length singe-track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle . i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound . generally , the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl ( probably jaguar or leapord ) loudly punctuates the sequence . it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered . once you know this is present in this recording , it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again .
1	this song is really great for a praise team and child choir . the lyric are great . i did not like the video though .
1	a+ this one is worth the money ! ( i listen to it 3x a week )
1	one the best song i have ever heard ! my favorite song of the year .
0	not that bad of a tribute cd , but a for myself , i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp . the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album . if you are a major , and i do mean major floyd nut , you may get more out of this cd than i did . the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy , the woman vocalist just go on and on . to put it another way , the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band .
1	this song and version of the song are amazing ! this version of the song is so beautiful ! i love it ! i love it ! i love it !
0	this is good . - i am not a fan of this band music . - i can not say anything bad about this album . - i will buy/listen to this record .
0	there is no song on this album that i will recommend to anyone . it is a terrible album that could be mistaken for a commercial recording . it is a terrible album that will make you wonder why you ever bought an album from capitol record .
1	i love this song
0	i love this cd . i believe that this is the album that she should have been on year ago . i love the way she make her song so real and the feeling i get listening to her song . i get the same feeling listening to her a i do when i listen to my sister . i love this cd and i will never stop listening to it . i will definitely buy the other album . this is a great cd that i have purchased twice .
0	this is his best song to date .
1	this song is so much fun and just make me smile . i like the song .
1	this is a generic box set . there is nothing special . i would like to have a booklet or a liner note . it is very generic . it would be nice to have booklet or liner note . the song are generic . they are very boring . it doe not matter . i would listen to it . i do not really need a cd to get my music
0	this cd is an album of worship song . some of the song are good , some of them are not . i have been listening to this cd for quite some time . i like the song on it , but i would not recommend this cd to anyone . the song are weak and i can not even stand the cd . i am sorry i bought this cd .
0	i think the song are great , but the song is a little to commercial for me .
1	this is by far the best show of the 70 and 80 , and it is not over played . i think it is a very rare find , and i am surprised that it is only 50 dollar on amazon . i found it in a used book store for 49.95. i did not know if it wa new or used and i am so glad i did . this is a great show , i am glad i found it . i had never heard of this show before and it ha been a big part of my life . this is a must-have !
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
0	what a waste of time to have something so annoying and annoying .
1	this album sound like
0	this is my all time favorite artist . he is a genius and can sing to almost any song ever written . one of his song is i wan na go home , which will make you cry . also , if you watch the video , it show him smiling so much he look like a kid with a toothache . i hope he get in touch with you and we can all sing together . he is a great artist , and a very kind man .
1	this is a great album for fan of the band with a certain style . it is a very good album for fan of the band that will enjoy it . it is a very good album in general .
0	nothing new here , except the packaging . this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio . the reason i highlight single is because , what the heck is a single these day ? although there wa actually a 45 rpm 7 vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio , it wa just issued only for , probably , collector like me . the other new single , is not it time , only exists on the album .
1	really surprised at how good this is . i am not a big blur fan but this album is one of my favorite .
1	this is a very well done tribute cd to the floyd album the dark side of the moon . the song are all really good . i have a problem with the version of money on the cd . the floyd cd is superior . i would have liked to have seen a better version of wish you were here . i agree with the reviewer who said it is a little corny . the song another brick in the wall part ii is my favorite . i wish they had done a better job with the female vocalist . i also wish they had done more with the male vocalist . i would have liked to have seen them cover song like set the control for the heart of the sun , brain damage , in the flesh , i am not there , echo , and wish you were here . all in all , this is a very well done tribute cd to the floyd album the dark side of the moon . i would recommend this to my friend .
1	ive always loved this cd and i think it one of the best .
0	i wa really excited when they got signed with virgin . it wa a very special moment . it wa one of those time where i saw that their work wa very good . i love the way that the song flow . i have listened to all of their song . i really liked how you remind me when i wa a teenager . i think that is one of my favorite song from them . i like the way that the guitar is played . i like the way that they play the guitar . this is a good song . i also like their album that they recorded before they got signed with virgin . it is not bad . i like the way they play the guitar . i like the way that they play the guitar . i like their album . i love this song . i think that this song is a little bit more rock and roll than some of their other song . i think that this song is a little bit more rock and more rock and roll than some of their other song .
1	this is an amazing song .
0	*
1	i really like this song . it is very catchy . it reminds me of a country song .
0	this song is not for everyone - especially since many people have this stomach thing . it is really a sad song and can make you cry . just something to think about before downloading this .
1	i ’ ve been looking for a cd with a song that i had never heard before so i went to amazon to see what i could find . i found this cd and i ’ m really pleased with it . i ’ ve been listening to it a lot . it ’ s a really good cd . i ’ m really picky , and i ’ m sure most people are , but i think this cd is worth the money .

0	this cd is awesome . this is another great cd that i am going to get . this is the best cd that i have ever heard . this is the best cd that i have ever heard . i do not know why this album is so important to me , because i just do not listen to pearl jam .
0	my wife bought me this album for christmas . this album is the worst album i have listen to . i am just gon na go ahead and say this is the worst of the worst album . this is the worst album i have ever listened to . it is just boring and generic . it is so bad it will probably delete it from my account .
1	very nice album , well put together
1	the first randy bachman album are so good , so please continue with this album , but please take care of the song , since we all will miss them .
1	this is a pretty , pretty song . very nice . i do wish they had added some more instrumentals to the song . it would have been nice to hear more of natalies voice . i wa listening to this song right before i started this review , and i still could not tell if it wa a male or female voice . it could have been either . i do not know what the difference is . i like this song . i think it is a great song . i would like to hear more of her voice .
1	i love this cd and have listened to it many time . i am not a gospel fan , but i have purchased several album from the aretha franklin archive and this is one of my favorite . i have listened to it many time and i love it . this is a great , great cd .
0	this music is very boring . the only thing i can say is that it is a cool cd .
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how
1	i have been a huge fan of stryper since the early year and i can not wait to hear more new material from them .
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent .
0	love the goat , but this song . well , seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song .
0	not a fan of lou reed , do not know why they put this on , i will probably never buy it . it is alright , but is too short . i like john zorn better , but i am a big lou reed fan .
0	i did not know what to expect from jewel , but after listening to the first few track , i have to say i am thoroughly impressed . i have been looking for some of the new jewel , and listening to this is just giving me all the reason i need to give jewel a try . if you are a fan of dance music , this is an excellent cd to listen to . even though the song are not necessarily on the dance floor , it is the perfect soundtrack for a night of dancing .
1	i do not love this song but i love this song so i thought i would share it . very good job by the entire cast of this movie !
0	the first time i heard this song i thought it wa a joke . i never really listened to it but now i want to put it on . the melody of this song make me think of the sound of a cell phone vibrating at a party when i am trying to make a drink . i like the lyric and the message and i can not wait to hear this song .
1	the song is not bad , but it doe not stand out from the others .
0	01-06- making memory of us.mp3 could not be imported . the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me .
1	another solid release ! this cd fit in well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year .
1	this radiohead is the best album that i have heard .
1	_ _
0	horrible . do not buy it . i would rather suck puke through a straw . this is the worst song i have ever heard . yuk .
0	i liked it , but it is not an album i would listen to very often . i do not like the music and i do not know why he put it out , but it is ok .
0	i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape .
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place . if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed . at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing . other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad . i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album . i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
1	this is one of my favorite album ever . i love the band that do the song that are in this album and want to hear them all . this album is the best .
0	in the late 1970s there wa a yes-inspired wannabee band called starcastle . starcastle were goodish , they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album , but they were not in the same league with yes . starcastles arrangement were softer , le articulate , and their lyric were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace . you know , star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist , but what wa the point ? i regret to say this , but fly from here sound like starcastle .
0	i am a big fan of his music . this cd is great . i would like to hear all the song , but the one i do have are great . some of the song are better than the one on the other two cd . i have the first three song on this cd . so i do not know if it is worth the money . this is a very good cd .
1	i have been a fan of the movie psycho for many year , and have been reading the book the psycho file by mark r. kausler for several year . i wa thrilled to find the score to psycho soundtrack , and wa delighted to find that the original score is available to buy on amazon.com . the song are all well-known , and the music is a good a it get . i especially enjoyed the haunting do not cry .
0	i really wanted this cd player case for my mp3 player .
0	i love i am not in love by the smith . i like the way it sound . i like listening to it even though i do not really like the man singing it .
0	the song are good for the money they cost .
0	this album is sooo good !
0	i purchased a copy of this album just to find out the truth . the manowars first album wa one of the best album ever and i really enjoyed the whole concept . this album is nothing like that . to me this album ha been a total disappointment and i can not believe that people are still buying this album . i own every manowar album and have been a fan of them since the first album . i will not be buying their next album . this album is just a joke and a waste of money . they should have just left it alone and put out the first album .
1	i hated their voice at first , and i hated the lyric . but i listened to the whole thing twice , and it actually is kinda catchy . but everyone is different . for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear .
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
1	this album really reminded me a bit of the beatles . this album really reminded me a bit
1	i am a fan of the original version of this song . the lyric are fun to sing . i really like this song and will buy it again .
1	i like this song a i know it wa meant for his father tug mcgraw . it is a great song and tim doe a good job singing it but i am not a fan of tims .
0	i bought this album to listen to while cooking .
0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
1	i am a huge fan of this band . i wa drawn to this song because of the guitar riff . i also really like the fact that the vocal on this song sound like they are in a pop band . i like the way that the guitar riff are written and the way that the guitar solo sound like it fit in with the band . the drum on this song also work really well .
1	i love this cd . the music is well done and the vocal are good . it is a real musical treat for the ear . it is not a lady cd , but it is more than adequate for the entertainment of a young lady . i have been playing this cd for year and only recently bought a new digital player , so i have been able to keep this cd in my cd collection . i really like this album and i know other people will , too .
0	i have never been a fan of lucindas music but this album ha helped me come around . i am now a fan . i think it is a great album .
0	worse song ever , with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates ? get a life .
0	i do not have the download . help guideline not working , the cancel button wa hit immediately but account still charged , please credit my account
1	this album took me by surprise . i thought that there were a few great song on the original but this is so much better . it is like i wa walking into a big room filled with beautiful people and the room wa filled with music . i love it .
0	this wa not a good song . i will buy it because it is my first rap song , and i do not know any better .
0	this album i am really enjoying . i have listened to it many time . the sound quality is very good .
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
1	i really like this album . it reminds me of the music i heard when i wa a kid and when i first started listening to disco . there are a lot of great song on this album ( but just a little help is my number one ) . the world of nat king cole is a good album , but it is kind of strange because it is a medley of the song that he sang on in the 1960s . i also think that he should have done a medley of the song he sang in the 90 . but it is a good album nonetheless .
1	a great band . i love all the different way they play the same kind of music . i do not really do a lot of country . i think it would be an impossible task to pick just one favorite . this band make me just want to listen to all of their music . great vocal , guitar , bass . all in all , they are just great !
1	a great song . i love this song .
0	great album , not too many vocal track ( like santa claus and jingle bell ) so that it is not like all the song are sung . it is a great mix of all the song from the 60 .
0	not at all what i expected . kind of insipid .
1	this cd is a collection of country music made with the sound of the late 60 through the 80 . the song are very good and the vocal are great .
1	this cd rock .
1	this is a very good compilation compilation cd that contains many different song , all of which are from the early 90 . i can not say that i really like many of the song , but they are good for the price .
1	i wa not a fan , but i could not find it on the internet , so i wa glad to see it wa still available . it is a great collection of song , and i am glad to have it .
0	the i love is a great song , but the rest of the album is average . the album sound like a jukebox filled with song that have been played all the time . the i love is a great song , but the rest is average . the album sound like a jukebox filled with out of tune song that have been played all the time . the album is a jukebox of song that have been played all the time . the i love you is a great song but the album is average .
1	this album is a complete waste . i should have waited for the next album .
1	it is been a while since i have really listened to tegan and sara , but when in heard i could not be your friend i immediately had to buy the album . i am so glad i did because i had forgotten how much i loved them ! i love this album - it is a bit different than what their old stuff wa like , but it is still awesome !
0	i love the studio version . but why do i have it on repeat ? i love to hear this live .
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
0	this album is not a very good listen . i would not recommend it to anyone , but to those who love it , it is a beautiful and powerful piece of music .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the amazon downloader would not allow a second try . i asked for and received a refund .
0	occasional ( just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off ) popping noise and brief second where there is no sound occasionally . only found this with his recording and i have not tried them all . wish i could return this purchase a i will not be listening again . : /
0	this is a pretty good song , but it is not a good a the original . it is a little too slow for my taste , but overall it is a pretty good song .
1	this is a good arrangement of the song lily of the valley .
1	i bought the stryper record the other day and i wa amazed at how different it is from previous album . very , very different ! i am really enjoying my time with this album so far , and i am looking forward to hearing more from it in the future .
1	what a great song ! i love listening to it every day because it reminds me of being at the beach the day after a great vacation . love that old school jazz music .
1	i am very pleased with the clean version of the cd
1	i think this song is a masterpiece . i love it . it is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . it is like a lullaby that you do not want to get up and go to bed .
1	the band is great . i love the band and i love the album .
1	i love the thriller cover more than the actual song .
0	i like this song but i do not think she deserves it .
1	this is an excellent album . it is a very good mix of genre and the vocal are very good and the instrumentals are great , but the vocal are short , and the instrumentals are very good , but the vocal are too short , and this is a good album .
1	this collection of song is a great collection of song . i have listened to this album a hundred time and it never get old . i love the fact that the song have a definite theme that you can relate to . the song on the album are a perfect fit for my life and they keep me listening to them and i can not get tired of them .
0	i have listened to them all , and i have to say that i have never been so disappointed in a band music before . i feel like i have wasted my time listening to this over the past few week . it is nothing more than a mediocre pop album . i am really disappointed with the quality of the music . i hope they are just trying to get into the music industry , because it would be a shame if they never got another chance to create music .
1	i have been a huge fan of the movie psycho , and have been listening to the soundtrack for year . i am very excited to be able to buy this soundtrack .
1	this is a great album for a lot of different reason . i like the song , the lyric , and the fact that it is not a typical music cd . i also like the song that are not on the album . i love listening to it . this is a great album !
1	the original version is the best and the remix is the worst . the original is much better , but the remix is better .
0	i enjoy this song and i am sure that it is a hit for jewel . i have it on my play list for when i will have time to watch the jewel video . i have not heard this cd in awhile and it is time to pull it out again . i really enjoy jewel work . if you are not a jewel fan , this is a great song to listen to .
1	i am not sure what to think of this album . it is too
1	love this song , it is a great song , nice little melody , i do not know what this is but i love it , and i am glad it is on this album .
0	i will second that ! i have been a beatles fan since 1966 and this is one of my favorite album . i love the song and the way the album flow . i would recommend this album to anyone but i would be careful what you buy from this artist . it is a very safe album . you will not find this album in any chain store . you will not find this album on any of the best online store . if you are a beatles fan , you will not find this album in any chain store . you will not hear this album on any of the best online store . i am glad i bought this album .
1	i have already listened to this cd twice . it is brilliant . if you are a fan of electronic music you must have this cd . i recommend this cd to all of my friend .
0	this wa a good song , but it is another one of those thing that i feel like wa put out because it wa a good song , but it is not really a good song at all .
1	the best song of the movie !
0	i used to listen to the rolling stone but they were just another band with a singer and a drummer . i discovered them when i wa 16 , and i have been a fan ever since . i started off a a fan of the beatles , and i have been to every beatles concert i can find since then . there would be time where i would find myself thinking , why do we have to listen to this ? this is just a bunch of song that are already on tape . we do not need to hear them . we have better thing to do . and then there would be time where i would realize that if i wa going to say , let me go , i would have to say it right now . and when i would say it , i would feel like the rest of this world would be saying , let me go . and then i would realize , i can not go . i am already here . i am part of this world . i love the beatles , and i love these guy . but i am not a fan of the beatles . i listen to this album for two reason . number one , i love their music . number two , i love their band . when i am with my band , i am not listening to them . i am not listening to the beatles . i am just getting some tune out of my head . this album doe not really have any song that i like . it is just a bunch of song that i love . they have been on the radio for a long time . they are just song that i love . i do not really listen to a lot of old rock and roll , but i do listen to a lot of new rock and roll .
1	the audio quality is perfect and i really love the way it look and sound . the only thing i would suggest is that you have to have the song on cd to really get the full sound out of it and that they would be better suited to play on a stereo .
1	this wa the most beautiful concert i have ever seen . i wa overwhelmed with emotion while i wa listening to this beautiful music . i am a huge fan of this band . this is a great album .
1	this is a really good album . i do not often buy music so i am happy i bought this . the song are good , but the production is horrible . it is like listening to a horrible
0	
1	i love this song ! this song ha the best lyric i have ever heard . it is a great song and a great song structure . it is a great song and a great song structure . the song is a great song very beautiful the song ha a great melody the song ha a great melody
0	this is not only a very good album , but it is a great album . it is a very well produced album that flow well and the song are very well written . the album ha a good mix of rock , electronic and r & b .
1	the lyric are great , i love the song .
0	i bought this album purely because i love country music and i wanted to hear a version of this song . the album wa well worth the money and i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys country music . i own several cd by this artist and this is not one of them . i have bought several cd by this artist and this is not one of them .
0	i have always liked frank sinatra , but i am not a fan , but i love this cd .
0	i like the band album , and so doe everyone else . but there are issue with the track . the i love rock n roll song is the only song on this album that i do not like . i think it is because they seem to have a lot of filler between the song . there are a few good song and a couple not so good song , but there are a lot of mediocre song . the album ha been out for a long time , and yet the only song that ha not been a hit is the i love rock n roll song . this is not what i wa expecting .
0	this is a really good album . i have listened to it twice and really enjoyed it . the song all the young dude is my favorite song on the album . there is one song , smoke in the house , that i did not like , but it did not really bother me . i would say this album is worth it .
1	this album is another amazing album by ahmad jamal . the music is brilliant , and the arrangement , while not flawless , are so beautiful . the music is really one of a kind , and it is a shame that this album ha only been officially released on cd . for the first time i have heard a recording of the song is you by the beatles . the others are : all the thing you are by the beatles , the impossible dream by john lennon , shade by the beach boy , the new world by james taylor , and when i fall in love by the beatles .
1	this is a great song . i love this song . i really hope that the person who wrote this review will listen to it .
0	this song is a little too similar to i will never smile again by the 5th dimension . maybe not the best song , but it can still be a good song .
0	an album that is a good follow up to what they have released so far . good song , good production . a good album .
1	i love this album . god bless you , derek horton , wherever you are .

1	he is singing about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved this m cd . i love the song on it . i have listened to most of the song . he ha a great voice .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
0	nice tribute to syd barrett , but i would like to hear it with more floyd emphasis and le keith emerson .
0	i really enjoyed this album , but i think it wa a little too much of a good thing . the music is great , the song are great , and the album is a great success . i would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys rock music .
0	it seems to be a good song . it ha a nice beat and ha a good message .
0	the lyric and music are amazing . i have listened to all the cd and the only thing that make this cd better is that the cd are in better quality .
0	tom skiba ha been a musician for a long time , and i have long been a fan of his work . this is a great album . you can tell a lot of time and care ha been put into making this . he ha done a good job making it a great album . he ha done a good job of putting in the time to make this a good album that people will enjoy .
1	this song will bring your heart to worship !
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill . i even use it a a ringtone for my phone .
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd . i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen , ( very good song ) but this eternalize cd fell way short . musically these kid are very talented and great musician , however i thought the song writing wa bad , the lyric bad , and the vocal were bad - vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling .
1	the album is full of awesome worship song . the band is awesome . the lyric are beautiful . the sound is awesome . i have only listened to a couple of song from this album , but i can hardly wait for the album to be released .
1	this song ha this really old-school groove and i thought it wa about dancing . i do not know how they made it popular . anyway , it is a great song .
1	this album is great but the most amazing song on the album is aint no rest for the wicked . really cool track !
1	it is a catchy song . i like the message . i hope this song will be on the album .
0	a very good song , i really like it .
1	i have listened to some ani williams album . i really like her music . the
1	wow . this is an awesome cd . i have not heard a better one in a while . i am glad i purchased it and am looking forward to listening to it . i really like the way the band play . their song selection is great . i love listening to older music . i think this would make a great gift for any guy , especially one that want to try some new stuff . i know i would like to listen to a few of the song on this cd . i just do not know if i would enjoy them .
1	i like the song on this cd . they sound better than the sound quality you can get on the cd .
0	this is a very graphic book and i thought the book wa censored . i read the book on amazon and i wa surprised to see that it wa censored . the book ha a sex scene in it that is censored and not shown in the film the devil wear pradada .
0	i can not believe there are no 5 star review of this cd . i have been looking for year for an album that would be a perfect addition to my record collection . i am absolutely disappointed . there is no music on here . the only thing that is on it is some lame rap music .
0	i have purchased this cd on several occasion and i always am delighted with it quality . the song are well sung . the song are in good quality . the quality is excellent . the only negative thing i can say about this cd is that it is a little expensive . i have purchased it several time and i am always delighted with the music .
0	this song just doe not do it for me . this song is not my favorite .
1	the first song i had a listen to on this album wa mile to go , and i wa hooked the second i heard it . the rest of these song are pretty great too so check them out .
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time .
1	i like this song . i have never had an issue with amazon before and i wanted to buy it to listen to it while i wa relaxing . i can not wait for it to be over . i really like the song .
0	i love this album . it is a fantastic collection of great song . that said , i wa a little disappointed in the recording quality , but i am not a music critic .
1	this is the best album i have heard so far . the lyric are so inspiring and i love the music .
0	not the version i knew or wanted . did not know that before purchase ! wa not given possibility to see that it wa a different version . did not say remix when purchased .
0	i like this album and the sound of the music .
0	i like christmas song . this song wa a favorite of mine , and i am glad that i wa able to get it for myself .
0	i have enjoyed the way this album ha been presented . i think it is a well thought out , interesting album . i like the way the album is arranged . overall , i think it is a good album . i think you need to listen to a lot of different music . there are so many style and genre to choose from . the only drawback i can think of to this album is the sound quality of the song . you will probably not be able to listen to this album without an external speaker . this is a personal choice on my part . i do not think the music on this record is bad , but the presentation is not up to par for a classical sounding album . yours truly , jeff l .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
1	love casting crown . their song always speak to my heart . always uplifting . one of their best song yet . like to hear more

0	i have listened to this album a couple of time and i really , really do not like it . it is not funny . it is not interesting . i do not like the vocal . i do not like the song .
1	i use to hear that song without knowing the title . i finally found it and i am enjoying it . thanks to amazon for making purchase so easy and good quality music .
1	it is a christmas cd i can not wait to play and listen to each christmas morning . i have bought it several time and never let it go . the song are beautiful and the orchestra and vocal are wonderful . i only wish they would have an option to choose the voice . but this cd is worth it , and i will buy it again .
1	i have listened to this album several time now and have enjoyed it much . i like the song on this album .

1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
0	a great compilation of song .
1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
1	there are two thing that i enjoy about this album . one is the musicianship and the great lyric . the other is the fact that they all sound like song we know . we all hear song all the time but they never sound the same . we all have been in a band and i know that when i hear a song and see the group playing it , it never sound the same . this is a great album for music lover .
1	i am so glad i bought this cd because i love all the song .
0	this album really helped me out . i am not sure i would have had the same success without it . it really help a lot when you have a little one who is interested in music .

1	this is a great song i have heard on several different cd , i loved it the first time i heard it and i could not stop listening to it . it is so inspirational .
1	i am a huge fan of tegan and sara , and tegan and sara are one of my favourite band . they are one of my favourite band because every song is different and you get to hear a different side of them . they have been on my playlist for a long time . this album is great !
1	i love this cd , it is the only cd that i listen to when i am bored .
0	this song is good , but i am a little nervous listening to it .
0	could not stomach much of this . slow , lifeless , abomination of the real symphony . depressing .
0	i am not a big fan of the band and have not heard this cd . i will try to listen to it , but i am not a huge fan of the band .
0	i just love this album . it is a real classic , and not only for the music , but for the lyric and the vocal .

1	i love this song , and the vocal are well on point .
1	it is light hearted and happy . it fit in nicely a background for a slideshow i did .
1	ive been listening to this cd for a couple of year . it not new but the cd is one of the best of the genre .
0	this is the best song on the album , hand down . i do remember hearing it on a radio show or something . i can not even remember the name of it . i think it wa on a show or something .
1	i can not see how this song could be improved upon .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick !
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
1	i know you are probably thinking , why on earth would i want to buy this for my child ? well , because the album is beautiful , it is educational , it is educational , and it is educational . there is not any way i could say more about this album . i have actually tried to tell my son that the album wa not for him and that he is too young to enjoy it , and i would not recommend it to him . but , my son is three year old and he is still excited about it . the only bad thing about the album is that it is made for child and they are not allowed to use the cd player i bought for him . he is allowed to listen to it on his own ipod , and that is it .
0	it is good , but it really a mix of style , but i prefer the original version . my favorite piece is the original version of only love can break your heart , i hope he doe another one .
0	downloaded just fine . not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than i did not like the song and it work just fine .
1	great song is time of need when you need to lifted up . my soul do say yes to the creator of this universe . lord , i thank you and continue to bless brian wilson . this man can sing anything that is family oriented and church .
1	i have to admit , that i had not heard this song before listening to this album . i wa surprised to find it in the album . the lyric are so sweet . it is a really catchy song . natalie is a great singer . it is a great album .
0	what an awful album .
0	i used this site to find out about the grateful dead . i love listening to their music .
0	i love this band ! this band is great ! the song on this cd are really good ! everyone i have seen play this cd is a great live act , i have seen everyone play this cd at least once !
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .
0	a good album , but the vocal performance is too weak for me to sing along .
1	loved this album ! i bought it a a birthday present but i can not wait to get it into my car and listen to it so i can drive around and listen to it while i am driving !

0	i have not listened to this one yet , but i will soon . i thought it wa a great listen and thought it may be the best book i have ever listened to .
0	another one of those song we can sing with gusto . i just wish the lyric were not so repetitive and the vocal performance were better .
0	i think this song is great . the song is very catchy and ha a good melody and lyric but it is not what i would consider a great song . the vocalist doe not do a very good job .
1	this album of pop/rock is a very good album . i really like the band .
0	there are two version of this song- the original and the remix . the original is better , and the remix doe not reflect the original .
0	this song could be a pop-punk anthem , but it ha some pretty good lyric .
0	this is a great album , but the lyric are a little cheesy and it lack the oomph that made this album great before .
1	i just had this cd and i really like the song . this one ha good song . i like the song . i like the music . i really like this cd . when i had this cd i really liked the song . the song are good , but the music is not always . i would have to say that the music is good but the lyric are not always . i am not sure that i will buy the cd , but i still like the song .
1	it is very easy to fall in love with a song , but when you listen to that song over and over you start to realize just how much you love it . this is the case with the heart of saturday night . i loved it on the record , but this version is great . it flow better . i wa a little disappointed at the beginning with the string section . i thought they were going to overpower the song a little , but no , they brought it down to a fine art . the viola and cello were on point for the most part . the first two or three time i listened to it , i thought i could hear my own voice in the song . it really is that great . i am not sure if it is because i am older and my voice ha gotten a little bit softer , but this version is a lot better than my old record .
0	this song had a good melody but the vocalist sounded a little off .
1	jazz version .
0	i like this song . i can not believe i bought it . i do not know if it really is the best song ever , but it will get you through the day . the only trouble wa getting in the right key to sing the lyric . it wasnt bad , just a little hard for me to understand .
1	good quality sound and it wa the original . enjoyed listening to this - took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio .
0	? - what the hell is that ! ?

1	i love this song . it fit the movie .
1	this is one of my favorite mouse song .
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd . i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen , ( very good song ) but this eternalize cd fell way short . musically these kid are very talented and great musician , however i thought the song writing wa bad , the lyric bad , and the vocal were bad - vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling .
1	i have listened to this album for many year . it is a must have for all . the song are great , the instrumentation is not bad , the lyric are great , and the quality is great .
0	i am disappointed that this cd doe not have a dvd .
1	this song rock !
0	i love this song , but i am not a big fan of it . i hear the chorus and i hear the guitar and i just do not like it . i like the opening and i like the ending but i do not like the song . it feel like it is trying so hard to be something it is not .

0	i have been a fan of both the old and new music of the band and this is a good mix of both . first it is a good mix of old and new music . second it is good for a new band to get their name out there . third it is good for their new album to show that they are different , better , more original , etc . fourth it is a good listen to hear if you are a fan of the new music or if you have not heard them . fifth it is good for you not to care about the new music or not to care about the new band . sixth it is good to have a new band with a new name and a new album . the only negative thing about this album is that it doe not have a good vocal . i like this band but they did not have a good vocal on this album .

1	this is a great album , with an excellent selection of song . even though i do not like some of the song , i enjoy this album quite a lot . only problem is that i am still stuck with my old music player . not sure if i will get a replacement soon or not . the other song are great , but the selection is not a good a the song on rubber soul . the music is just fine . buy it .

1	i love this song . i love the way christian sings it . very smooth .
1	i like it . i like the voice of the artist . it just make me happy .
1	this is a very good version of the song , but it doe not quite hold up a well a the original version . it is a little bit shorter but it is still very nice . it is a good version .
1	the song is very catchy and fun . i really enjoy this song . it make me feel good and it make me feel good while i am listening to this song . i would give it a 5 star rating if i could .
1	i guess this is a tribute to the old school country music but i love it . i am a fan of lucinda but her music ha always been a mystery to me . i have looked at the lyric a bunch of time and i can not figure out what it is about . the song is great .
1	i love this album . i listen to it over and over .

0	i love this cd . it the best cd by this group .
1	this is one of those rare album that i listen to on repeat . that is a good thing , because the song are all great . i would have to say this is a favorite track of mine and it is one of those song that i listen to over and over . it is almost like a lullaby , where you just listen to the song and you feel like you are in a peaceful place . that is a really good thing . overall , a great listen .
1	an amazing album . i love this band .
1	i love the album and the song . i have listened to it many time . i like the song and the vocal . i think the album is very good . it is the best album i have listened to so far .
0	i like this album very much . i like it a lot . i like it a lot . it is not bad . it is not good . it is a bit like i like the sound of my car and it is a toyota . it is okay . the best thing about it is not to listen to the lyric of the song . it is not too bad . it is not too good . it is not too ugly . it is not too good . it is not too bad . it is not too good . it is not too bad .
1	i really like this album . the production is very good . the music is very good .
0	this is a great album , but there are only 6 track . i wish there were more . what are the chance of a new sandman album in the near future ?
0	very boring and boring .
0	this mp3 player is not working .
1	great song .
1	a to the other review , it is a christmas cd , but you need to buy it . it is a good cd , but you need to buy it . it is a good cd and it is worth it .
0	i love this song and i love the band . it is a song i have listened to a lot , since it wa released in the 80 . i have several friend who are kiss fan and they love it too . it is a song they have been covering for year .
0	blur is amazing . this album is fantastic . this album is full of great song . i love blur .
0	this is the best cd ever . i have listened to this song 1000 time . what an amazing voice . i love her voice . i have a little sister so i love this song . i would never have a cd without her !
1	i have been really looking forward to this album ever since i heard about it . i have heard some of the song a while ago and i really like the way doyle lawson and quicksilver have been putting their thought into what i would call bluegrass . i have tried to listen to this album more than once , but i get the feeling that i am missing the whole point of what the album is about . at this point , i have listened to the whole album , but my favorite song are still the one i have heard so many time before . i do not expect this album to change my mind about anything , but i am still looking forward to it .
0	i listen to alot of music , and i have never seen an artist cover a song that i have never heard ! i know you can not make up for lack of exposure , but you can at least present a version that is completely new and different . i do find it bizarre that when you put the cd in the player , the song will play , and then you have to hit play again . for someone who ha not heard the song , you have to play it over and over , again and again before it play . that is a very frustrating experience .
0	i like the song , but the lyric and the music are just not for me . i do not like the meaning of the song .
1	this is the best album that i have listened to so far . this album is so good , i would recommend it for everyone who like dance music .
1	this is a great cd , it ha some great song .
0	everyone love a holiday song , and i really like this one .
0	condition wa stated acceptable . hardly listenable .
0	i do not like this cd , i just do not like all the song on it . i hate the fact that they are completely missing from the cd . the lyric are written on the back of the cd without any information on them . they are so written that i can not know whether they are true or not . i do not know whether to hate this cd or not .
0	a lot of people will claim that the book is censored . i do not know why . most of the scene that are censored are the sex scene . the book is very graphic in that it show a lot of sex . the most graphic scene wa a couple having sex . the only scene that wa not censored wa the same scene a it wa shown in the movie the devil wear prada . the actual scene wa shown in the movie , but the scene wa not shown in the book . it wa shown in a deleted scene in the movie . i do not know why it wa censored in the book in the first place . most of the censoring wa done for the sex scene and is not to censorship the book itself but only the sex scene .
0	i bought this because the cranberry were on the radio and i like their music . i really like all i want by the cranberry . i bought it because it wa on the radio . i wa disappointed in the song , but the band wa great . i wish i had bought the album .
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make . loved other album of theirs . but this one is different . it good . but i do not care for it . it wa a great buy .
1	this album is amazing ! my boyfriend and i have been listening to it every day for
0	this is a good album . it ha a lot of cool song , and they are all good . i like this album a lot . it is just the same . they have some good song , but they do not go far enough . the only song that i like is called til i wake . it is just a good song , but it just doe not do it for me anymore . it is like the same song , but now it is a lot of word . i am not sure what to listen to now .
0	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record these . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat .
1	this album ha a number of great song ,
1	great cover ! great music ! i am glad i bought this cd !
1	i think this is the best song in the movie . it is a great tune .
0	i have been listening to the most recent felt album , and i can not say i have noticed a difference . the song are decent , but nothing to write home about . the lyric are boring and the vocal are bad . i can not believe how bad the album is . i am disappointed and will not buy it .
0	the album ha a lot of song that are not related to each other . i don t think this album is very good .
1	i thought it wa a good album . i thought that it wa very good .
1	this is a great album . i love this album . i love the lyric .
0	you can buy a cd same price with 73 track on it.so if you have not got that.then do not buy this nokia site a the album on download
0	the song are very similar . i have no idea why the tracklisting is so different . it is not exactly the same .
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe . if your fed up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer , and need something different , this song might be good for you .
0	the vocal on this album are very low and i have found that they sound very shrill and artificial . the production is not good and there is no energy in the music .
0	. but this is a poorly produced cd . both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo , and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment .
0	i have been a dylan fan from way back . and , i am also a big sinatra fan . i write this review from that perspective . what ha happened to american culture , that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer ? are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence ? anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra , and how he did these song . and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all , getting by , because they are supposedly emoting .
0	i listened to this song by jeremy camp when i wa a child . i loved it so much i could not stop listening . i still love this song when i am alone , but when i am with the family i do not get a much out of it . i do not think the lyric are very good because they did not tell u what he wa about to do for the first half of the song . i think the chorus is funny and make the song memorable . i think the lyric are ok , but they do not tell u what he wa about to do for the first half of that song . i think the chorus is funny and make the song memorable , but the lyric are not very good . i do not think jeremy camp vocal are very good . he is a nice guy , but he is never hit top grade a a vocalist . i do not think jeremy camp vocal will take me to the top of my list of favourite song . i am glad i have this cd because it ha such great memory of my childhood . i do not even know how it got there . i really like this song and i plan to listen to it again in the future .
1	i just got the great big story which wa the best album i have heard this year . i have listened to these song over and over again . the song are so different and personal , and i love them all . i would give this album 10 star
1	not much i can add to the other review , except that i really love this album ( a i think it is a great one ) and i am glad it is available on cd . it is really nice to have the whole album on one disc . there is a cd version with some song missing ( i think ) but this one is ok .
1	great album from the 60 . i like the song . the band is great . i am very happy with the album . this album is great .
1	this is my favorite cd .
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july 31 , 1964 at age 39 , his legion of fan simply refused to let go . from that point to 1984 no le than 34 of his rca single release would make the country chart , seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot 100. not even the late , great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour . i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef .
1	the presentation of this well-know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra . if you have not listened to it in a while , i strongly suggest that you revisit it . you will not be disappointed .
0	the absolutely worst song ever made . if you like screaming through the whole song , then you will love it . me , i like some melody and rhythm and not a bunch of woooo aaaaaa eeeeaaaaaaa .
1	a very good song that i used on my facebook page .
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i , m the biggest fun . once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed . very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth . i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin .
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 time both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album . ( i liked god of war ) . this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy .
1	i liked this song when i first heard it on the loud speaker at the gym , while i wa working out with weight .
0	thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software . i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so , or ever heard of the artist . very generic song , no redeeming quality for me . sound like just about everything else out there .
1	i think this is one of the best song ive heard this year . it is very melodious . it not very long but it is a great song .
1	if you are a radiohead fan and like indie music , you probably will like this album . it is fun and it ha great instrumentation and lyric .
1	i really like this album . the song are all very nice , but i think the sound is not very good . it sound like a poor cd instead of a good cd . the vocal are good , but the sound is not very good . it sound like a cd that i found at a friend house . i wish the vocal were better , the production is very simple and sound like a cd .
0	this song is one of my favorite . i find the melody great , the lyric are very catchy and the groove is amazing . it is a very heavy song , similar to what pink did in her early day but i prefer the version of this song on the album . it is not a bad album but it doe not really stand out . i find the other song to be better .
0	this wa one of the first song i ever discovered by this band , and i have since become an avid fan . i have loved several of their album , and while the song they have performed over the year have not always been my favorite , i always have an affinity for this one . i had heard it a couple time on the radio the same day that i heard it on the simpson the musical . i could not help but think that it wa a great parody of the simpson theme song . it wa just the right amount of scooby-doo-doo to make it a perfect parody .
0	i have listened to the dixie chick album a lot and i love it . the best part is that the song have great melody and lyric . the worst part is that the song are just awful . the music is very over-produced and i really can not stand it . i really think the band sound like they are in a trance , where they can not think of a way to get out of it . the lyric are good but not good enough . i wish the band would get back together and play a really good show again . i will still listen to the album over and over again . i just wish the band would put out another good album instead of making it so bad .
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
1	beautiful music . perfect for the holiday season !
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . however , the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face ) . i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters .
1	this is really a great cd , i wa very satisfied with it .
0	this is one of my favorite song on the album ! it wa written by jon anderson for his album , the last supper the song wa released a a single , but did not chart . this version wa written and recorded two year prior to jons death .
1	a little bit of the more romantic side of zappa ( i.e . the side that ha yet to be tapped by the modern mainstream of music ) . at first , i wa a little disappointed by the lack of a more up-tempo , rock-oriented song . but a it kept playing after i turned it off , i wa pleasantly surprised by the more laid back , slow-paced , and reflective song that eventually ended up on the end . it is a little slow , but that is not why i rated it . the song wa just what i wa looking for .
1	i love this song . it is an incredibly positive song . i can really believe that this song wa written by a young , single girl who is completely in love with her boyfriend .
0	this is a poor recording of a great performance . i thought my stereo amplifier wa damaged when i heard the periodic crackling noise while playing the peer gynt suite 1 and 2. but no , i can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise ( but not a pronounced ) when playing the same track on my laptop pc using my bose headphone . this cd might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone . however , if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo , do not waste your money on this rubbish .
0	one song that is listenable but they changed from it is original composition . shame .
1	
1	such a great tune and could listen to it all day . blake clean version is just a good . make all redneck proud .
1	i am a huge fan of this band . my favorite song is probably frozen :
0	i do not like the new version . the original is better .
1	this is a great song , very memorable . the drum are awesome , the guitar is great . the vocal are good , but not amazing . the production is very nice and the song is very memorable . this is a great song , but the recording process of this is a trial and error . the drum are awesome , the guitar is great . the vocal is good , but not great . the production quality is very nice and the song is very memorable and ha been on the all-time best list for year .
0	no thanks . i love the song but that is all .
0	this album is very good and adam ha a great talent to write good song . the song are very well produced , and the melody are very nice . the album ha a good mix with rock , electronic , and r & b. i think adam should keep on putting out good album .
0	the buy now button ha no effect .
0	this song is catchy and cute . i like the song , but i do not like the artist .
0	this song make me want to vomit . the sound quality is horrible , and it sound like the person singing is drunk .
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
1	i have listened to every cd of theirs . they are one of my favorite . i really enjoyed my generation . it is a very uplifting song .
1	this is a great album . i listened to this album for the first time , almost a year ago . i had never heard this song before , but i remember listening to it and thinking , this is the best song on the album !

0	i purchased this a few day ago , and i have been using it . i can not find a good place to put it . i have tried , and i can not find it anywhere . i have searched everywhere i can think of , and i can not find it anywhere . i have tried putting it in my ipod , and it will not play . i tried putting it in my cd player , and it will not play . i am sorry , but i just do not see how i am supposed to use this product . it doe not work . i do not see why it would work , and i can not find it anywhere . any suggestion would be welcome , because i need to use this product . i do not like the music . i do not like the fact that i can not find the music anywhere . i do not like the fact that i can not find a good place to put it . i do not know what to say . i do not like it . i do not know how i got it . i do not know why it would work . i am just sick of it . i am sorry , but you took something that should be free , and you gave me something that is worthless . i do not know what i am doing wrong . i do not know what to do . please help . i do not know what to do . thanks . i hope this doe not sound too negative , but it is . it is just a really bad product . i can not believe you took something that should be free and you gave me something that is worthless . it doe not work . i can not believe you took something that should be free and gave me something that is worthless .
1	i think this album is very good , but i do have some complaint .
1	i thought that this wa a great album , but then i got to the end and realized that everything wa in the same key . some song are very slow , and some song are very fast , but that did not bother me . the best thing about the cd is that the song have never sounded better on any other album . i am glad i bought this cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	there is a reason this recording is dirt cheap - it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it . you would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell .
1	this is the best album by a young artist i have ever heard . at 16 year old , she ha a very mature voice . she is got a great voice and her talent is obvious . this is the first album i have ever heard of a young artist . i think this girl ha a bright future in music and i hope she grows up to be an amazing artist .
1	the first album is a masterpiece of music made by a band that wa a little too young to be making music . the band doe not make any apology for their early 20 mistake . the album is filled with great song , and the band never stop playing them . the sound quality is not great , but it is not horrible either . the lyric are good and the band is still very good . the band ha a good rhythm section and they are a very great rhythm section . the guitar playing is pretty good and the bass is not too bad . the band ha a great harmony section , and it is one of the better harmony section i have heard since i have been listening to music . the best part of this album is that it is a collection of song that were written in 1962 , which is the best year so far for rock and roll . the problem with this album is that the band is still young and not very good and they are very good at making mistake . the album ha some great song and it is a good album , but it is not a great album . the lyric range from good to great to great and the music is very good .
0	a good album , but it is not the best album . it is good music , and it is a start . i wish there were more album , but this is good to begin with .
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it .
0	ive been downloading music to my ipad , but i can not bring myself to buy the cd . they really do add to the problem .
1	this is a book by an author named dave enchautegui . i have read it and i love it . i will read it again soon because i love it . this review is based on review from amazon . but i am not sure why you would want to buy a book that the author will never write again . this is the kind of book that will make your family hate you and your friend a well a the author .
0	i just got this cd on cd and have yet to play it . i have heard some good song , but no one ha yet to take the time to make it listenable . if you are an artist or producer , please make it listenable . i would love to hear it on a big screen .
0	i am sure the author wa trying to make a great christian-like album but the lyric were so poor and i thought it wa unlistenable .
0	i have to say that this album is great . it is an excellent cd . the song in it are beautiful , and the production is top-notch . what more can i say ?
1	this is one of the best album of 2012 . - andy williams - the g-force
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
1	this album ha some really great christian song . i like the different style of music . i will buy the cd again . it is a great cd of christian music . i have it and use it .
1	i heard the song on the radio and wa hooked . i love the way the music play and the feel of the music . i would recommend this song to everyone .
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
1	i like it . i like the way christian sings it . very smooth .
1	lyric are good , song is good , guitar is good , bass is good , drum are good , vocal are good , the production is good , and the artwork is good .
0	i do not think this performance is bad at all . it is just not very good . i felt like i wa hearing a very familiar gibson voice , but it wa too thin and thin . this performance ha a lot of the same issue a the house of the rising sun that i did not like . the song is still a pleasant listen , however .
0	the movie is good but the soundtrack is the best . i am a big fan of the movie and the soundtrack .
0	this album is one of the best and i love it .
0	i am sorry . i have not been able to listen to this all the way through twice . love come to life wa amazing . i suppose this may be a worship album , but it lack all of the dynamic variety of come to life , which ha had me in tear many time . i will be selling it .
1	this band is great . i love them .
1	this band is one of my favorite band . they are one of those band that you are not that surprised when you hear them and it doe not bother you . they have a great sound and they are incredibly talented .
1	this song is so great . i love this song .
1	love this album . it is a great song from the classic album highway to hell . some of the best song from this album are highway to hell , you shook me heaven , shoot to thrill , hell bell , and rock n roll .
0	this is good but it is just not my favorite song .
1	this is a fun song to play when you are going out to dinner . it a great way to get the whole family together , especially when you have a good time . this is a great song to play at the holiday , and it is perfect for the kid .
0	i like other song by her better , this song is okay , but she ha done a lot better on her other song .
0	this song is very inspiring and positive . she ha a beautiful voice .
0	this is a really nice audio cd that you can listen to a many time a you want . i have not had the opportunity to try it yet , but it is really good . it is pretty much tropical jungle music that is soothing to the soul . i have heard some of the other audio cd on this list that i have seen , but i think this is the best of the bunch .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .
0	i think this is one of the worst song ever . i can not understand it .
1	gwar - live at the marquee - 1986 i have actually never heard of this band before . i have been searching for this album for month . this album is my favorite metal album ( to date ) and i have never heard so much quality in a metal album . this is the best album for me . i really like it . thank you .
1	i have always had a love for the beatles and the first time i saw them live i wa hooked . i have been a fan ever since . this album is a good example of how the beatles and others have been influenced by the motown sound , but also how they have been able to move forward and create new sound that still sound like the beatles to me .
1	i am a big fan of this album . i just got this album . i love it .
1	jewel ha a voice that is hard to resist . the new disc ha some really nice , fresh , new song . she sound better than ever , and her music is better by far . her voice is a little deeper and better defined , and the music move forward . her voice is just a good a it wa in her classic day , but the music is different . the song on the new cd are not the same song a the old cd . there are some song i do not like - or song that are not a good a the old one - but she sound wonderful , and i am a fan . i do not have a new cd , but i hope she doe soon because she ha the voice , the talent , and the ability .
1	i wa happy to see this album in my local library . i have listened to this cd a few time and it is one of the best that i have ever heard . it really is a great collection of song .

1	- i like it , but there is nothing new in it .
0	this song is one of jewel best . it is a great song .
0	this cd is all i could have hoped for when i heard jackyl play live . i have listened to their soundtrack and the new album , and this is the best of the bunch . i love the way the lyric flow and the songwriting is very good . i am very impressed with this album . i have listened to it for hour . i can not believe that a jackyl album is a good a this one .
1	i have to say , i really , really like this album . the instrument are really good , i thought the vocal were really good , and i really like the arrangement .
0	this album just seems like a collection of song that could be in any number of different style .
0	what is bad about this album is the repetitive and boring nature of the song . song that could have been really good have a lot of repetitive line and a lot of the song are not very memorable .
1	i really enjoy this album . the song are very good and i really like the different voice that alex clare us . these are the song that i have listened to over and over again . hand are clever , hummingbird , and despi .
0	i really like this album . it is good . i will probably buy it again . i think it is a lot better than hellbilly delux . it is a lot better than sinister urge . i do not know why zombie would do this release . i do not know why he would do this release . i think they should just do a whole series . i think they should just do a whole series . i will probably buy this album again .
0	this song is the worst song i have ever listened to since i have been on the internet .
1	i like many of the song on this cd . most of the music is fantastic , and the lyric are very clear . the song are a little on the slower side , but it is not too bad . i think it would be a good album for a rainy day . if you are looking for something a little more upbeat , i would recommend this cd . otherwise , this is a great album for those who like to listen to music that is uplifting .
1	i have bought this album a few time , but i really love it . it is so beautiful and i am really amazed at how they have been able to put so many great song on the cd .
1	i like it . i think this will be my new favorite album . i really like it , too .
1	a great song
0	0304 wa so bad that it made me feel bad that i even let myself get this close to the album . the album is full of bland song sung by a man who can not sing and a bunch of people who can not sing .
0	i wa out christmas shopping today and the store i wa in wa playing this cd in the background . when i went to purchase my item i heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me . the manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded the new jessica simpson christmas cd . i heard the manager then reply can you please stop the music , it is scaring the customer and it is really bad for business . i wa so enthralled and fascinated at this point i had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she wa so insistant that they cut the cd off .
0	i like this song , but it is a little too repetitive . it is a good song though .
1	the cd got to pr in no time , it wa in great condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
0	i am a big fan of elvis costello , the man , and the album is great .
1	i wa really surprised when i came out of the store to find this cd on the shelf ! i have been looking for this cd for a long time . i wish i had heard this a long time ago . it is very good . i am really glad i bought this cd !
0	i have been looking forward to this release for quite some time . i love that it is an album of her classic song , but i am glad that there is a new collection of song . i can not say that i like the new song all that much , but i like the old one more . i feel like she is doing something new with the song . i can not say it is better or different , but i can say it is different . she is still the same person . she is still the same person , and i like what she is doing . this is the jewel i like .
1	i have ordered from amazon several time , and so far they have always delivered a promised .
0	ive heard of this cd before , but i like it . it one of my favorite .
0	this song would not let u play the song excepton .
1	this is a gem !
0	i bought this on a whim one day and i have to admit i wa very disappointed . i do not like johnny hartmans song at all . the song wa so bad i would prefer to listen to something else for a while .
0	i love rihanna . i have listened to her entire catalog , and this is my favorite so far .
1	it sound great and the price wa right
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at any price !
0	this album is not bad . i like the way she sings . it is a good album with some good song . i have liked this album . it ha a good vocal . i have not had a chance to listen to it in a long time , but i listened to it once and i liked it . it ha some good song on it . it ha a good album . i have liked this album . it ha a good album . i have liked this album a lot . i have liked this album a lot .
1	i love this song because it speaks to me .
0	first of all , let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day , i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the 80 stuff . in fact , chicago 16 is one of my favorite album by the band . and 17 is an album that they have every right to be very proud of . and while 18 and 19 were just cranking-out-the-formula album for them at that point , they at least had some huge hit single , which wa really all the band wa about at that point .
1	this album by michael jackson is a classic with a great rock sound . this album is a must-have for fan of the band .
1	excellent single to celebrate the 51th anniversary of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last 25 year . this single keep you moving unless you are dead and did not know it . lol excellent !
0	this album is awesome . i love it !
0	i had no idea this wa coming out when it wa released , but i loved this album when i first heard it . cocaine blue is the best of the album . the music is great and the vocal are excellent .
1	this band ha a very unique sound . they have a mix of root and rock element . the production on this cd is very professional and the arrangement are very impressive . the best part of this cd is the singing and playing . the cd is great .
1	this song is for all the kid who were raised on this type of music . it reminds of a time when our parent were listening to the radio in the car or at work , and they would take out their transistor radio and dance along to these oldie that they loved . it is a great song for the little one who are getting into music and it is a wonderful song to play when you are going out for a night on the town .
1	the music wa very good and the lyric were very good . i would recommend this cd to anyone who wanted a good , fresh , rock and roll album . well worth the price .
1	a classic in my opinion , i love love love the lyric . this band is amazing ! their music is so creative and unique and i just love everything about it . this band is so good to listen to and i have to say that .
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one . very short a little over a minute . buyer should be notified . have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample .
0	i bought this album thinking it wa going to be a good album but it turned out to be a complete disappointment . i will not give it a rating because i do not think a full review is necessary . i am sorry to say that i am not a fan of this album and do not see the appeal of the music .
1	this is a very well written song and it take you through the different emotion it creates . it is sung in a very honest and sincere way . it ha a great message and the lyric make you think . it is a very powerful , touching and heartwarming song .
0	it is just a nice album for me . i like the beat and the message is really great and it sound good . it is just a nice album .
1	enjoying listening to mark chesnutt on cassette especially bubba shot the jukebox , since that is what i call my new nissan juke , my jukebox . i wa ruining my cd so i have been playing cassesttes while i wash and wax my jukebox .
1	this is an incredible worship album that is sure to be a huge hit with the fan of the band .
1	this cd is a great mix of christmas music . i would listen to this cd at least once a year . i love the singing and the song . i wish , though , they would allow the user to choose the voice . but that is not a problem with the cd . i love the music and the voice . i wish , though , they would allow the user to choose a stereo or mono version . but that is not an issue with the cd . i love the music and voice . i wish , though , they would allow the user to select the voice . but that is not an issue with the cd . i would buy this cd again .
1	typical hank williams , jr. modern country with a serious message . make me proud to be an american .
1	this album wa one of the best that i have heard . the song are good and the vocal are ok. i would recommend this album to a friend .
0	this song doe not do anything for me .
1	a catchy song with a strong message that will make people smile and maybe even cry . i can not help but hope the song will be included in the next album . i am not crazy about the song but i am glad they did a cover . i hope it is a good version .
0	i think this is a great song . the only problem i have with it is that the lyric are written in the present tense . for example , when they sing you got me loving you so much , i do not know how i would stop , it would be more fitting to say i love you so much , i do not know how i would stop loving you .
0	in my opinion , the best album in recent year .
0	their entire discography on this one is great and i love this album . it is very long but worth it .
0	a great album that is very disappointing . it is not a bad album , but it is not an amazing one .
1	very good tune , but the lyric are very slow . i like this song .
1	i love this album ! i love this album ! i love this album !
1	i am a huge fan of the film , and the music is good . i would like to hear this song used in the movie . it will probably be used a a single . i hope the movie is good . i like the movie . this is a good song .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
1	i like the clean version of this cd .
0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
0	i wanted to be entertained so i listened to the first song and could not help but burst out into laughter . the rest of the cd wa not nearly a entertaining . there were too many filler song and some of the song were totally boring . i understand that the guy were looking to create a new sound for their band but this cd wa not it .
0	i am a huge van morrison fan and this is no exception . i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys his music .
1	i have to say that i am very impressed with this album , i have listened to this album over and over again . i will say , that i am very impressed with the arrangement of the song and the harmony between the instrument . the way the harmony are arranged is beautiful , the arrangement are very well done . the song are very well made , and the quality of the sound is just right . i highly recommend this album .
1	this album is great , although it is missing the great song from the first three album . but it is still a very good album , although it is missing the great song from the first three album .
0	i think this is the best album bob dylan ha ever made . i think this is one of his best album . i believe this is a very good album because it is very interesting . the song are very good and the singing is good . and the whole album is very good .
1	this is a good song .

1	i absolutely love this song . back in the day when i wa a little girl , i would hear my grandparent playing the song because it would come on the radio which now make me feel old but i am only 38. i love older song and this is one of many that emmylou harris wrote that is still popular to this day .

0	: very pleasant .
0	this is a good cd , but what they do with it is not what i wa looking for .
1	i have been a fan of the music of yolanda adam since i first heard her on the radio in the early 90 . now , i am a member of the choir at grace baptist church , and have been a fan of her for over 20 year .
0	this wa purchased for someone else . i do not like it because i think it is an annoying song . not my type of music .
1	this is one of my favorite song . the bass and drum are awesome .
0	this is a great cd . i love the song on this cd . i will buy the album .
0	just bought this album again . i really love the song on it . i am hoping that this will be my last purchase from this record company . it doe not cost me anything , and i am not really interesting in the music , the only thing i care about is the cover . the worst cover i have ever seen for a record , and i have seen alot . the worst album i have ever heard ( except for the one you will listen to in your next life ) . the worst album . ever .
0	this movie wa great , but the soundtrack wa terrible .
1	i am a big fan of ryan leslie , i love his music , but now i really love this album . i guess i wasnt a fan until ryan leslie came out with this album . i love the production of this album ! the beat is hot , he add his own flavor ! his lyric are great , the beat are hot and the production is hot . i love it ! i love this album !

1	i am an old fan of zaba . i have been listening to this album for many year . i love this album . i recommend it to any zaba fan .
0	a good tune , but the lyric do not work for me . i do not think i have ever heard a song that i did not like .
1	i have no idea what this is about . maybe it is about the guy who make the music and the girl who love him . i really do not know .
1	this ha all the hallmark of a classic manowar album , with a unique production , and is a high quality record from one of the most influential group to ever rock the metal scene . the vocal are brilliant , and the band is definitely one to watch out for .
1	this is a very good album and it is not just another diary of a madman album . for this reason it is still a must purchase . the song that made me do it wa can not help falling in love and with this kind of music i do not find a single song more enjoyable than this one . great music and good production .
1	this is a really good album . there are some very good song on just about every song on the album . i would recommend this album to those who like rock and roll .
1	i love all of these song . it is almost like they were made for each other . i love all of these song . it is almost like they were done together .
1	i have been a fan of joe augustine for many year . i love the god bless the child song .
1	i really like this song . i would love to see this song played on the dvd . i think it is a great song . this song is a positive addition to the album .
0	i liked this album because of the lyric and the sound . i bought this album a few week ago , and i am still not sure if i should recommend it to others .
1	i think that this album is a really good one . i think that this album is one of the best that i have ever listened to .
0	this song is my theme song . it just so happens that it is one of my all time favorite song . it is just a wonderful , pleasant song . the only problem is , it is just not good enough to justify this song . the song is great , but it is just not good of enough to justify this song .
0	i do not really know why i bought this . it is only 5 minute long . but i guess i can not complain .
0	this cd wa originally released in a stereo version with the original mono transfer . the sound is good quality . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favorite album by far .
0	this is the only album i have not liked . it ha some very good song , but they are very similar song . i am not a hank williams fan at all , but i do enjoy some of his song .
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered . i have no regret about this purchase .
0	to me this wa one of the worst song of the year . it is annoying because the music for the where my heart go song is used in the final scene of the movie , the dark knight rise . i do not know what the composer of the movie wa thinking when they used the song . the music to the movie wa great but the song just sounded like a horrible version of i am so happy that you are mine from the movie titanic . the song is extremely repetetive . the music in this song is repetitive and the lyric are the same a the beginning of the song . it is very annoying and i can not stand it . the only good thing about the song is that it is not in the movie . i think this song should be banned .
1	air return with love 2 - their best work , in my opinion , since 1998s moon safari . the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound ( do the joy ) and synth-driven scope ( be a bee ) . alternatively , the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop-tune to date with sing sang sung . with this type of contrast ( notable from quite an early stage on the album ) one ha to expect some surprise along the way .
0	my daughter is a big fan of the movie . she say it is the best movie she ha seen . i think it is . but i would like to hear the song used a a single .
1	best version of one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario , visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to .
0	i just bought this cd . i bought the first cd because i liked the song you can not always get what you want . this cd doe not have any new song . i have listened to it . it is ok. i like it . it is a good cd .
0	i have been listening to alex clare for year . i like his you can not always get what you want cd . he ha an amazing voice and is a very good song writer . for me this cd is a must have .
0	i like some of floyds earlier work , but this record is a disaster . i do not understand why they could not have gotten a different singer to sing the harmony . but the music is so good , and the lyric are so beautiful , and i love the guitar work . however , i do wish floyd would have just left the lyric to the song alone , cause i really do not understand how anyone could not like this album .
0	i like this song .
0	i have a song i am trying to put out there . it is a great tune , but it is not a song i would put in my car - at least not the kind of car i would be driving . the kind of car i could barely afford to drive without falling into debt . the tune is called you are my sunshine and is written by randy newman . the opening word are not the most inspiring - i would have to say , i feel like a king today/i am so glad it is you . this song ha been a personal favorite of mine for a long time - i remember when i wa in college , i had a boyfriend who loved it a much a i did . the only problem is , i do not remember him doing it . in fact , he wa a jerk . i still love that song , though , and i am glad that i still have it . i hope this post find you , and that you are enjoying this release . if you are a blogger , then you can add your review and rating to the side of the page at the bottom of the post .
0	i think the song is interesting , but i do not like the song . i am not a fan of the lyric .

0	this is a good album , but i do not think anyone will listen to it .
1	i had most of these number on two cassette tape , which eventually wore out , so i wa delighted to find they would been combined into one cd . the quality wa excellent and it wa like having an old friend who would moved away come back to the neighborhood !
1	prince . wa . one . of . the . greatest . of . all . time . and . i. love . his . music
1	bonnie is a very talented singer and a very good songwriter . she ha a great voice and an amazing talent . you can hear some of the change in style through her voice . the song just do not seem to flow with each other , they are all very different and seem to be coming out of different side of bonnies personality . i love her and am looking forward to her next album .
0	this one is not good at all . used to be a fan of his but he is fallen . he is fallen far . it is a sad effort to be honest .

1	i can listen to this one over and over again .
0	: i thought i would like this , but i really did not care for it .
0	lost is right , this disc being the covermount ( not for resale ) disc from classic rock magazine issue 103 , march 2007. it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time , overlooked gem and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan . ummm . well part of that plan ha been achieved . they are certainly curio . curio from the realm of apathy generation . because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track .
0	sound like rap and i do not care a bit for it
0	i really liked this album , but the sound quality wa really poor ( i am not sure if it wa vinyl or cd ) . i wa disappointed that i did not like the album , but i thought i would give it a shot . i still do not know what it is that make it so good . i am a big fan of classical music . i have been listening to classical music for about 15 year .
1	this cd is a real gem .
0	this album wa a great listen . i do not really like the whole album , but the first half is very good . the second half is very disappointing . it is hard to say what wa wrong with this album . the good song were great , but the bad one are pretty bad . i would not listen to it again .
0	i just do not like this song and i did not even know that this song wa on this cd . i just do not like this song . the only thing that i like about this song is the last line of the song . the song is not very good . i just do not like this song . the vocalist in this song is not very good and i do not like the song . the song is not very good . i just did not like this song . i just do not like this song .
0	! this cd wa not at all what i expected . i wa excited about it and thought i would like it . but i did not . i really did not like the way it sounded . i think it wa too much of the whitney sound . this is the best whitney cd i have not heard . she is one of the best singer . i am glad i had the chance to hear her live . i am sorry but whitney is such a great singer . it is a pity that she wa not able to sing a well a she did in her 70 . i am very disappointed in this cd . i did not like it at all . i will not buy it . it wa a waste of money .
0	i would buy this album if it wa available in cd . i like the vocal and instrumentation . i like the song . i would buy this album if it wa available in cd .
0	this review is for a book by a man named dan enchautegui . i have already read the book and found it to be a good read , but the music wa so bad i had to buy it so i could listen to it . i am surprised that you can buy a book that ha so much positive and this one so bad that you have to buy it . the author even go so far a to say i am an advocate for peace and yet he is a staunch opponent of the cop killer lilo brancato . he is a racist , a bigot , and a misogynist . he is the worst of all of them but the music is so bad that i had to buy it so i could listen to it .
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
0	i am not a big fan of this song . i like bob marley and reggae , but i have heard he is not the best singer . i am not sure what i am thinking when i listen to this song , but i am glad i ordered it . i have tried to download the song back , but it is a no go . i have tried to play the song back on my kindle , but it is a no go . i have no idea what to do . i would like to hear if anyone else ha had this problem .
1	this is not a bad cd . at all .
0	i have heard of this band before , but i can not seem to remember who they are . i am not a fan , but i find their music very appealing .
1	the most amazing thing about this cd is how poorly the vocal are recorded .
1	the good morning song is what i bought this for , but love the cd a well . the good morning song can take a drabby day and put pep in your step , brighten your face a you sing along & dance with her . thank you mandisa for blessing u with your god given talent !
1	i love the song light out , which wa written by the band guitarist . i always thought it wa a band that wa going to be bigger than they are now , but now i am just happy to have heard it !
1	this is a really good album . it is a hard album to listen to , but i really like it . the song are very good and the production is great . it ha nice song . the song are very short and have a short message . it is a good album . the lyric are well thought out . they really make the song stronger . i also enjoyed the message on this album . it is a good message , but it is a little slow to get through .

0	the arrangement of the song lily of the valley from the greatest hit album is fine , but it doe not stand out from the pack . the sound is bright , but it doe not sound very good .

1	i have been looking for this cd for a long time , and it is finally here ! i bought it on a whim , and it is a great gift .
1	this is one of the best holiday gift i could ever have gotten . it is not the most expensive , but at the same time , it is the most unique and i love the quality of the product . the artwork is great and the music is pretty good .

0	i like the way this album is put together . i really like how waylon and jessi work together . i think this is a really good album .
1	if you have the desire to listen to real metal , you must listen to gwar . they are the best band out there . they are a great band .
0	not what i expected . it is kind of dreary and depressing . i love iris but not this one .
1	the cd is amazing ! the song are well written and the music is quite . i enjoy listening to the cd when i am driving . i would not say that all of the song on the cd have the same level of quality , but i am sure you will be able to find a song that you like . i like that the song are longer than the typical christian worship song that most christian artist are supposed to write , so you can take your time with the song . i like the fact that this cd ha a message in the song title . for example , love win is a very uplifting song , while jesus is lord ha a very positive message . i would not say that the song are all good , but they all add to the overall message of the cd : god love u .
1	i have been a bruce fan since the 70 and i have been listening to this the whole time . i have been to the show and i have been to many concert too . i love this album . it is a good album . i think this is a good album . i really like bruce . i really like this album .
1	this a great cd by two great artist . it is pure country , both vocal and the music are outstanding .
1	i like this album and have been a fan since i first heard it back in the late 70 . i have had it for year now and i have kept it and listened to it over and over again . i have been listening to it for two week now and i am still enjoying it . i am glad i bought it .
0	this cd ha a lot of great song , but i wish i could have listened longer . the voice are not very good . i got le than what free could be . the music is very repetitive . this cd is not worth the price of the shipping .
1	this is the absolute best song i have ever heard . i will be singing this song throughout my life .
0	i think this is a very good song for christmas time . it is a nice song .
0	this is not the song i wanted , and i do not know how to download it . i miss the old day , when you bought a song and then you actually owned it . how can i embed this in a powerpoint ? how could i use it in a photo slideshow ? grrr . im hopelessly left behind by technology and im only 33
0	i do not like the band or the song . they make the song sound like a total joke .
0	the album is good , but i do not like the way they try to imitate the sound of a real garage band . it wa okay at first , but after a while i got sick of it . also , the production is terrible . the guitar are very loud and all the instrument sound alike . the drum sound very bad . even the vocal sound the same . i am not a big earl fan , but i think this album is good for people who like song with a nice beat and a good guitar playing . i will say he is better than the others , but who care ? the sound quality just is not good enough to be on an album that would sell well .
1	a good album . but i am afraid that
1	the song is great and the bass is perfect for the song . i listened to it after i had listened to a song called i am a dope and thought it sounded good so i purchased the album . i wa right .
0	why is there so much singing in this song ?
0	i have listened to this album a few time . i like it a lot . i would give it 7 star
0	great music , but i wa disappointed that the dvd wa only $ 9.99 and not with the cd .
0	this song doe not have the typical pop beat . the song ha a very unique and cool sound .

1	
0	i listened to this song for the first time last night , and it is one of the worst song i have ever heard . there were no word , the singing wa garbled , and the melody wa very poorly sung and the lyric were not accurate . i have never heard such a poor recording . it wa hard to discern what the lyric were , but the singing wa very poor . if it were possible to take the cd out of the player and make it scratch/scrape/crush the plastic , that would be the next step . i hope they can fix this recording so they can make another and keep making them .
1	this is a wonderful collection of song and i am glad we have found it .
0	i bought this song , hoping that this version also included the verse a well a the refrain . sadly , it is only the refrain . my mom used to sing this song around the house , and i had searched for a long time for a recording ( with word ) . the listen ability on amazon only give a bit of the refrain , but i purchased it anyway with great hope . ok , it wa only 99 cent , so no harm done . but , it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse .
1	this wa purchased for christmas . it is a nice album . i bought it for my son a a gift .
0	this is one of their best album . i just bought this book and i am looking forward to reading it . the story is great . i have one of the cd and i like it .
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
1	this is an outstanding speaker system ! we have a brand new , factory installed , 7.2 surround sound setup in our bedroom .
0	i wa very disappointed with this song . i found it very boring . it wa basically the same song a when the angel by the monkees . i do not know why they took the song and made it into a christmas song . maybe they should have just made it into a regular song , instead of a christmas song . the vocal were okay , but they felt very forced . i also do not think the song is a christmas song . it feel more like a song about the dead , or something like that . the only redeeming quality of this song is the fact that it wa very fun to sing . i can sing it quite well . i wa singing the whole song from memory , and i actually liked it .
1	i love all the song in this album . this is a great album .
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular 5 yr ago . really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era ( and since ) . am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune ? she flat out every few bar , she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average . overall kind ofmeh .
1	i love this band .
0	i don ’ t really like this album .
0	bwb is a great collaboration , but this album dropped the ball . every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre . the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work . i am not sure what intent for that wa , but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through , not this .
0	i read this book when i wa a kid and i am still reading it . i am sure that i will end up reading this book again a i grow older . i think it is the best book i have ever read . this is the only book that i have read that i have not been bored by . i have read the book a few time now and i am really enjoying it . i have a cd with this book on it and i like it . i have a cd with the other book and i like the other book better .
1	i have heard them many time and i have been a fan of o.a . rock and roll since the late 60 . i have been to see them live many many time . i have seen them many time and i have been a fan for many year . i will definately buy this album . i have only seen them once in my life and i have been a fan for many year . i will definily buy this album .
0	this song wa a sad one . i like johnny hartmans song .
1	this song is a great song to start your worship service . i like to sing this song every time i start a new worship service .
1	the cd is a perfect selection for a christmas present . my husband and i have both purchased the cd and have listened to it many time . the music is perfect for a holiday gift . my husband and i sing along together .
1	my first impression of this album wa that it wa very good . it is not that i did not like it , but this wa one of the last album that i played on a regular basis . from what i have heard of this album , i think it is good , but i must have had a very different perspective on the album than a lot of other people . if you have not heard it yet , i strongly recommend you give it a try .
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
0	i have been listening to this cd for the last few month . i have to say that i am not a techno fan , unless it is a techno-house or techno-funk .
0	i just wanted to write a very brief review to let you know how much i liked the cd . my husband got me this cd and i am very happy with it . i love the song on this cd and the sound quality is great . i am very pleased with the quality and i also like the fact that you can download song for an extra fee . the only real negative thing i can say is that the price is a bit steep . i do know i would buy this cd again if i had the opportunity .
0	selfies are annoying enough , i do not see why an annoying song wa necessary . the white girl voice in this song is so unbelievably annoying . i want to just smash my headphone . i mean yes , it ha a catchy tune , but it is not the type of song that you spend money on . look up on youtube , watch it once , and then never discus it again .
1	i am very excited to put this cd on the list of my top 10 favorite cd of all time ! there are some real gem on here . i like the music a lot . i think it is worth the money , i am sure that you will like it too . this is one of my favorite country album . i would recommend this cd to anyone . i would give 5 star to this cd . i think it is worth the money . i would give it 5 star .
1	i think this is the best song in the movie . i have no complaint
0	it wa good . the story took some time to get through . it wa the radio version of the book , but it wa a little confusing .
0	i think that this album is a very good album . i think this album is a very good album , but the whole album is very disappointing . the whole album is very disappointing . the whole album is very disappointing .
0	i enjoyed the tribute to frank sinatra and wa sorry that the composer of the song did not include any vocal . the song did not resonate with me the way it ha with others who have heard it . i found most of the tune to be generic and uninspired .
0	this is just ok. this is my favorite beatles album .
1	i love the album .
1	this is my second favorite cd of all time . i will give it 3 star , but i feel like i could give it more .
1	this collection is great ! i bought a copy for my husband and i. i love it . it ha helped my husband tremendously in his piano lesson . i have been looking for a good collection for a long time . my son love it and my husband love it . they both play it all the time . i can not wait to buy more . my son is four . he is good at playing it but my husband is not . he play it for his son and my son love it .
0	? - what the hell is that ?
1	this is one of the few track that make me want to go to the gym and do the bodyweight exercise that i have been neglecting to do . i want to feel strong and energetic , i want to feel it deep within my body . the perfect soundtrack for my workout .
0	i feel like a really bad friend when i have to write a review of one of my friend album . i have had the good fortune to listen to just about every cd of the member of the band the dap-kings ( the dap-kings ) that is out there . now i have to write a review of their new album , in the shadow of a dap-king . i have listened to a couple of their album and have been disappointed with the sound quality of the recording . the dap-kings is an acoustic folk-rock band and they are making the best of it . i just wish they would come out with a cd with a better sound quality for a change . all in all , this is a good album but the sound quality is not what i would call a selling point .
1	it is a great song . i like the guitar that play in the background . the vocal are nice and pleasant . i can not put my finger on it , but it is a great song .
0	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can ’ t say it ’ s typical , but it ’ s soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefermk ’ s version .
1	mix in well with other song in cardio workout . when you get a little winded this will help keep you up .
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
1	this album ha a lot of great song . it is definitely not a hip hop album , but it is not a bad hip hop album . i think this could have some hip hop influence . the instrumentals are very good . i do not think it is a bad album , but it could have some hip hop influence .
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound .
1	i have been a fan of elvis costello since the early 80 . i love his song and the music he make .
0	alright , this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review . it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a 5 year old most likely did . the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know ! that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first 3 time . the final you do not know ! end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer . do not throw away your money , and if it is on the radio change the station !
0	this is a great album ! i love the beat and the lyric are great and it is a really good album .
1	this is a good album . it is not the best because these song are not really great but they are really good and they really push the boundary of what rock music can be . this is definitely an album that i would recommend to anyone who love rock music
1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few track took me back to dylan juda moment , i still recommend this wonderful series . my baby fell asleep within 20 minute of first firing it up , and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love for the pixy to share with me in the future . the stone one is good too . but mike , please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven , for u purist .
0	this song is an 80 ballad , but it is a great song . i wish they wouldve kept the chorus . there is no chorus . it is a very 80 rock song , but the guitar and drum are very 80 . the lyric are corny , and the vocal are weak , but it is a good song .
1	this is a really great compilation of great song . i can play all of them . the song the end is a little slow , but it is great . i think this album is great .
1	i like this album . it is my favorite album of coldplays . the song closer is my favorite . i do not think that they have made a better album than this one . i love that song . it is really unique . i like the way they make it . closer is my favorite song . i do not think they have made a better album than this one . i love that they made it so beautiful . closer is my favorite song . i don ’ t think they have made a better album than this one . i love the way they make it .
0	i don ’ t know if i have ever been this excited about a new wayne album . this is the first album i have purchased . i really like it and i highly recommend it .
1	i wa really expecting too much from this cd . i love roxy music and have listened to them since i wa in high school . i wa not disappointed . the sound quality is excellent , and the lyric are very good . i like the lyric , they are a little more positive than the other song in the collection . the sound quality is pretty good , but the lyric and song are excellent .
0	so far , my experience with this cd ha been positive . i am hoping for a good review . so far , my experience with this cd ha been positive . i am hoping for a good review .
0	another decent album . i really like the sound of the guitar . this group is a lot more bluesy than the last one . i think the production is way better than the last . the sound is much more bluesy than the last . also , this is the best production of the group so far . they seem to have a lot more control over their sound . but , the lyric are still hard for me to understand . i think they are for those who are not blue people . and , the song writing is not very good . and , this group is not a good vocal group . i think they are doing much better . but , the sound is kind of repetitive and boring . i think they should hire someone who know blue music . in the end , i am happy with this one .
0	! one of the best song of the year .
1	very interesting music . great for all age . i enjoy listening to more than one album at a time . great for the mature adult .
1	this is an awesome song .
1	this is a great album . i really liked the instrumentation and vocal . the lyric were great . i think that the instrumentals that are used are good but the vocal were a little weak .
0	i did not want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase .
0	this album is a real mixed bag . i love the album concept of bringing together the two former member of the hip hop group outkast and putting them together again . the album is full of catchy song that have really great hook but the production is off . the song are lacking the smoothness that we are used to from the group . their chemistry is still there , but they have lost their soul and soulful production . the other song are good , but they lack the energy that we are used to from the group .
0	i love this song . it ha become one of my favorite song in an era where they are not often featured in new disney movie . i have a soft spot for this song because this is a great song , and it is not too late to be true . a little disney in the middle of every show , and i think it is a great balance . i love the song that is not too late to be true .
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not totally accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got .
0	i heard a lot of good thing about this album so i bought it only to become disappointed . many of the song seem forced and repetitive if other hit they have had . i have it an honest listen several time before actually returning it-for me , it wa that bad . about the only good thing i can say is that blink 182 ha an awesome drummer .
1	a powerful and emotional song . the lyric seem to be personal . there is a message in there . this song speaks to me . i love this song .
1	i love her music ! this is a great song .
0	a great , rare cd that is worth the money . i have only one complaint . the liner note are written on a small , old , plastic card . i would have preferred a blank card to list just the song and their meaning . the only way to get a cd to you is through the mail . the shipping on this is super expensive , so make sure you have the money to afford the shipping if you are going to get this . i am sorry i am being so negative , but i would rather leave this review to let people know that this cd is a waste of money . i have a hard time spending $ 25 on a cd that i would find through word of mouth and a classified ad . i believe that the person who wrote this review ha a better opinion of this cd than i do .
0	this album is a great song , but i have to say , the lyric are kind of lame . it is not a very good album . the melody are great , and i really like the instrumentation . i like the concept , but i do not like the lyric . i think the fact that it is an album about a guy that love his wife so much , and then the next song he tell her she is the best thing he is ever been with . that is kinda lame , i think .
0	this album is better than i thought it would . i wa not surprised at all when i heard it .
0	it wa not the quality of the recording a such , but the length of the music that wa not what i expected , so i will not be downloading it again . ( 1 ) the sound quality wa very poor . ( 1 ) i wa not impressed by the content . ( 1 ) it took me way too long to get it turned off , ( 1 ) i had to press the power button to turn it off .
0	this song is awful . the second i opened this cd , i thought to myself , this is the worst song i have ever heard in my life . the 3rd time i played it , i thought , this is the worst song i have ever heard . if you are a serious musician , this is the worst song you have ever played . it is okay for background listening , but not for anything else , nothing . i would give you a 1 star for the title .
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist .
1	this wa fun . the first few song are a little rough and the last two are okay . the whole thing is very mellow and is a nice break from the usual rock-n-roll song . it is worth a listen .
0	this album is great . the lyric are very well written and the melody are great . i love the way the lyric flow and the song are very enjoyable . i am very impressed with this album . i have listened to it for hour . i do not think anyone in the music industry is doing this good of an album . i love this album . i am not disappointed because i love this album . this is the best of the best .
0	this collection is a collection of some of the worst song in history .
0	so . what is the story ? it wa a good song , but i wa disappointed with the vocal . my wife say , and i quote : i am glad that she had a chance to see it live because the vocal were so bad . the song is about a man who is not loved by his wife , therefore he doe not leave her . i like the song , but i thought the vocal were poor .
1	i just purchased the song . if you want to know why is it so great , just look at this review . it is a great song .
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening - and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book , little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience . not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale . but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection , i get a bit of the heebie-jeebies .
1	this wa the best song , in my opinion .
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a number of way this by far is one of the best
1	this is a song that i could listen to all night long . it brings back memory when i wa in the navy , and i wa stationed in japan for two tour . my dad and i would sit on the porch together and listen to this song . i like the slow , measured pace of this song .
1	the song on this cd are good , but you will enjoy them more if you buy the book . you will get a better deal .
0	i enjoy listening to this song . i like the message that is expressed in it .
1	this album ha some really good song . it is a little short , but i would not say it is bad . i like it .
0	this wa a song i purchased , but it got stuck in my ipod shuffle . so i went and bought another shuffle just for this song , and it worked perfectly . i have not listened to it in a long time , but if i do i will definitely buy it again .
1	this is a new recording of a song that they played for me . i thought it wa great . i think they did a great job .
0	the album wa a mix of good and bad . i think that it is going to be very hard to get to this album . it is very hard to find on itunes . it is very hard to find on amazon . the album is full of good song , but the vocal are lacking and they are not producing an original album . i do not know why they put so many song here . they do not have to put so many song on the album . the album doe not stand out from the rest of the album .
0	this album ha the feel of a record that wa made in the 70 . the way this music is presented is reminiscent of the early 60 , and for a short period of time . this album is really just a collection of great tune . but it doe not have the feel of a 60 tune , it feel like a collection that wa made in the 70 . i would like to hear the album without the overdubs , but i have no idea when the album wa actually made .
0	i am not a big fan of the new jewel , but i like her previous cd gone for good . it wa a really good one .
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
0	
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .
0	this is a pretty decent album , but i could not sit through all of it . it had way too many bad song and i could barely stand it .
1	this a nice pop song sung by a female that ha a very good sense of style .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
1	i have been listening to this album alot ! i love this album so much ! i really like it and i am glad i bought it . i love this album ! i really like it !
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .
0	this cd is not worth the money . the cd is full of good music , but the album is full of bad song .
1	i bought my first copy of this is christmas in a small town in colorado . i like that it is a collection of traditional christmas music . it is good music to play for our family . i bought this for my husband and son . this is a great collection . i am very happy . i love this collection .
1	i really like this band . i like the song .
1	this is the best of the bunch . a great album . the song are very good and the lyric are wonderful .
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener ! the whole project , fingerpaintings : serenity is like peace on a disc !
1	this album is a nice collection of acoustic blues/rock/jazz that have stood the test of time . this album is great for anyone who want to learn the old school blue . i like the way the music is presented with all the original take , all the overdubs and in the end it all just add up to a nice cd .
0	what a horrible song to write about the awful deed you did . innocent child were involved ! the lyric are atrocious . i know that because i read them online . you can never understand a word this woman say .
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
0	this song , love is not good . the lyric are not good . the music is not good . the song is not good . the song is not good .
1	i first discovered this singer by listening to her song love you madly . i am a fan of this artist since my discovery of her work
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time .
0	i like the song but i feel like the song wa a little too fast for the band but it is a good song and i do not know why it wa so hard to get the band to sing the chorus . i mean it is blink 182 so i get it but it is a little annoying . i like the song overall but the song is also boring .
0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
1	it is kinda boring , but i think it is worth it .
1	after listening to this album for a couple of day , i am feeling the same way . this album is a great album , however , the lyric are terrible . the chorus wa a big thing that bothered me , but i still believe i will like this album . i do believe itll be in my top 3 .
1	my boy favorite song . they sing this to the top of their lung . the youngest say we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan ! anointed !
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast , at least for me , with seemingly everything entertaining ( news program , comedy monologue , tv show ) around u hop , skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) . it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye . but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up ?
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book .
1	i love to see this stuff up on the radio , especially when the band ha done something that is never been done before . i think this album is a good introduction to soundgarden . the music is different , but the song are amazing . they make you feel all the emotion that you can feel inside of your heart . it is a great album and i hope they continue to make music .
1	i can not believe i liked this song , but it wa really pretty . i wish they had recorded more song like this .
0	great collection of song .
0	i am not a fan of the new stuff . : (

0	i am a fan of the band and the music is very good . i think i will have this cd in my collection for a long time .
0	i think this is a great record . i like the beat and the quality of the songwriting . i am not a huge fan of the beat , but i find them enjoyable , a i am not a huge fan of club music .
1	i just downloaded the song and i could not stop listening to it . it make me feel really good .
1	i do not know about you , but i love ty . when i think of him , i think of his beautiful voice , his unique sound and his ability to create great music . i am very happy to have found this cd and i wish him the best .
1	i purchased this cd expecting to find a good rock album but i wa pleasantly surprised . the instrumentation is very good and the song are fun to listen to . the song are not very long and are mostly very short . this album ha some really good song like new orleans and stoner . i would recommend this album to those who like rock and roll music like classic rock .
0	a very good song . i like it .
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar & electronics work . i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style . so far i have had only moderate success . hybrid fart ( that name should have been my first clue , if we are even talking about a bekker cd ) everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant ( not really the language of love , is it ? ) or perhaps not so wordy . for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake .
0	great cd ! i have all 3 cd . all three are very good , but the burden ( jarboe and the burden ) is the best . i like their version of i believe more than the original version by al kooper . the burden is probably my favorite .
0	my favrit josh groban ever . i play it every few day . wish he would do more showtunes and le opera
0	this song suck .
0	great , i like it , i am glad i bought it , but it is not my fav .
0	i do not like the sound of this album . there is one song called all thing which i like , but the rest of the song sound a little too much like one another . i think the next album will be good . the song sound different . i do not know if i should listen to the first album . i think a new producer should be involved . i do not think this is the right direction for the band . i like the band but i really do not like this album . i like the rest of the album . this is the only album i have ever bought by this band . the band is definitely a band to look out for . i will have to get the other album .
0	this cd is a gift for my husband , who say it is a perfect gift for people he love , and a wonderful gift for someone else . i love the cd , and i even like the cover- the music is beautiful . i am disappointed with the quality of the cd . the cover is so beautiful that it overwhelms the song .
1	i wa at my in-law house for christmas for the first time . i sang three or four song by the way . the song hark ! the herald angel sing wa on the radio . i wa sitting next to my wife and i wa singing it at the same time . the song is great . i do that when i get together with my wife . she like to sing along . we both love to sing .
1	i am so glad that i got this . the song is great and the studio is very nice . thank you so much ! i love the iron man character .
1	this song and it message is a little different from the rest of the song on this album . i like that .
0	i have not listened to this cd yet , but i am sure that it will be a good cd to listen to .
0	this is a very nice worship song . it ha a good message .
0	i bought this cd after hearing on the radio about it , but thought it wa just okay . i like it now . i have always liked alex and this cd is just another great cd in his catalog .
0	if this album is good , then anything is good . but it is just okay . this is a really great band and i really enjoy the song they are singing .
0	i bought a cd and the person that had ordered it wa not allowed to pick it up , only a delivery driver came and took it away . i am very upset . not sure if this is a one time thing or if this happens frequently , but if this happens again i will not order from amazon .
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast , at least for me , with seemingly everything entertaining ( news program , comedy monologue , tv show ) around u hop , skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) . it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye . but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up ?
1	this wa one
1	i love this album . it is definitely my favorite of all time . i do not listen to many mainstream pop song anymore , but i do listen to this album quite often
1	this is a great album of adam song , and it is a great compilation of his song . i love his voice and his choice of material . i wa really surprised by the quality of this album , and it is great that i found it .

1	this ha a great melody and lyric . it is an awesome song .
1	i have ordered a lot of cd from you . they have always been exactly a described .
1	the original is one of the most beautifully written song i have ever heard . i love that the song ha a slow and mellow feel to it . the lyric are very well-written , and the guitar solo ( that i did not include ) is amazing . i listen to this all the time now , and i am constantly looking forward to listening to the next track that i hear .
1	i think this album is pretty good , but it is not the greatest album ever . it is really good , but it is not the best . it is my favorite album , but i think the lyric do not suit me very well for this album . i do not even listen to this album in the beginning .
0	!

0	sound like it wa recorded during tuesday night music club ( i know it wasnt ) and that is not my favorite era of hers . sound sorta been-there-done-that . hope the rest of the detour cd is better .
1	i bought this album to relax and listen to it . i do not like it very much . the singer is mediocre . the song are interesting but the style of music is very boring . the music is very repetitive and not very interesting . it is almost like listening to someone reading a book . when listening to this album , i would recommend listening to it at a slower pace . i would also recommend listening to it by ear because it ha a very monotonous sound .
1	i like this band alot . i have been buying their cd for a while . i never had a problem with any of them . i think they all have great talent and are amazing .

1	this is my favorite song , and i will sing it in the shower and the car . i think it is a beautiful song . i really like the song . i can not wait to get a cd of it .
0	the new album is a good one . it doe not change jewel sound or her singing style . it simply add to the song that already exist , which is good . if you do not like jewel , you will probably like this album . i like it . it is on sale . if you like her , you will enjoy this album . i do not .
1	this is an interesting song from a different perspective . i love it . i love the piano and the violin that accompany the song . i listen to both version of the song every night . i usually fall asleep listening to the version on the record . this version is more like a film and i think it is the best version . i just do not know why the other version will not work . it is just not a good song . i do not know how much i love the song now a i did then . i guess i am just a little bit older . i have been trying to like it a little better . i do not know if i can . i guess i am just a little bit older . i do not know how much i love the song now a i did then . i guess i am just a little bit older .

0	this song is not bad . it is just not my favorite .
1	jessye norman ha a voice that is rich a the most elegant satin . i have purchased quite a few of her piece , why ? because thanks to amazon music , i can pick and choose and download the one i want . i have now loaded many of her spiritual , both solo and with kathleen battle , onto both the computer and my mp3 player , to enjoy whenever i choose . her singing is grand , the selecton is wonderful , and the price is right .
1	this is an awesome album . it is not a good a the previous one , but it is still a great album . i especially loved the music on this album .
0	this album is very good , but it sound like a remix of the beatles . the vocal are nice , but the harmony are so bad that they are not even close . the only good song on this album are the original . there are very annoying song on this album , like i do not wan na go home and the ballad of a thin man . these are the only good song on this album .

0	this cd is very good , but not in a hurry . i have played it on my cd player , but i am not sure if i would like to listen to it on my dvd player . it doe have one bonus track . the sound is quite good , but i personally think it would be better with bass or vocal . the only thing that i do not like about this cd is that it ha the song in a very repetitive manner . i do not know if it is just me , but i do not like record with repetitive song . the best song on this cd are lovin you tonight and someday . these two song are a bit different , and they are memorable . i do not know if it is just me , but i just do not like record that have repetitive song . i would love to hear a song that would be repetitive like foolish heart or how come i let you get away . i would like to hear a song that is repetitive like lovin you tonight or so far away . i think the cd would be better with different vocal , bass , or a new recording of i do not cry anymore or love me . i think it would be better with different arrangement or arrangement with no bass . it would also be better if it were recorded with vocal . i like the song i do not cry anymore and the song love me and i think it would be a great song to have on cd . i would love to hear a song that wa recorded with vocal . it would be good to have different arrangement or arrangement without bass . i like to have the cd with different arrangement or arrangement without bass . i think it would be better with a different bass . i like the song how come i let you get away and the song foolish heart and i think it would be a great song to have on cd , but i think the cd would be better with different vocal , bass , or vocal with no bass . i think the cd would be better with different arrangement or arrangement without bass . i think it would be good to have different vocal , bass , or vocal with no bass . i like the song i do not cry anymore and the song love me and i think it would be a good song to have on cd . i would like to hear a song that wa recorded with vocal . i like the song i do not cry and i think it would be a good song to have on cd , but i think the cd would be better with different arrangement or arrangement without bass , but i like the song love me and i think it would be a good song to have on cd . i like the song foolish heart and the song how come i let you get away and i think it would be a great song to have on cd , but i think the cd would be better without bass , but i like the song i do not cry anymore and the song love me and how come i let you get away and i think it would a good song to have on cd .
0	horrible . i only bought it because the ex-girlfriend wanted it . i wish there wa a no star rating .
1	this is my favorite album of all time .
0	this wa the first album i purchased by yes . it is the only album i have ever bought by the band . the first album by them i ever purchased wa the yes album which is still my favorite . i love the song , lifted . i could listen to them nonstop for hour on end . there is a song that i love all the time on most any live cd . the song is roundabout . i have loved yes since the very first time i heard roundabout . anytime i hear this song i melt . i love it . it is the first song i hear after i have slept . the song make my eyelid close . i know it is something magical the song and i know that i will wake up the next morning with a smile on my face .
1	it is ok
0	this album is great .
0	this is not a very good song . it is very repetetive and it just keep repeating the same word over and over again . i wish it would go away .
1	the band is still going strong and this is a strong album that should be on everyones list . the song are solid , and the song are good . not necessarily great , but good . the only negative thing for me wa the band name : i had to double check to make sure that it wa spelled correctly . i did not enjoy the song a much a i would have liked . they were not at all catchy or catchy enough . i think the song would have been better had they been more catchy . the instrumentation wa very strong . the bass wa good , the drum were good , the guitar were good , the keyboard were good , the organ wa good . it is not much , but it is great . the song are pretty much on par with each other , with a few track being better than others . i think the best song on the album were the two duet with bonnie raitt and sheryl crow . they were the two album i really liked .
0	oddly amusing song . wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger . lyric for the younger audience , good beat !
1	good music throughout . always favor original song . mix up tempos/styles- appeal to all age . she is a really good singer . glad to see her doing so well and overcoming a rough time with positive forward sailing .
0	i can not believe that a company would pas off a recording a being of the best recording of music that we have ever heard . i have always been a fan of music and have bought many cd . i have never found one that is worth the money that i have spent on it . this is a shame because this recording is so good .
0	i wish i could give this album le than a star . the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good review on this garbage . snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple . josh will soon have his child do kid bop christian album for sure . if i were amazon or any other business i would block josh from all other future endeavor .
0	this song need to be rerecorded . it sound terrible .
1	this cd is hilarious , i admit there are some song that are not really funny , but there always 1 or 2 bad song on an album ( in this one , the 1 bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song ) . also if you are easily offended by swearing , raciest remark ( do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny ) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this . but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
0	i really like this song .
0	this song is so sad .
1	overall , i found this album to be a very good collection of song about growing up . there is nothing bad about it , but there are more good song than bad one .
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	i used this song to set my alarm and turn on the radio when i woke up in the morning . i have listened to it a couple of time now and i think it is a lot better than the song on my ipod .
1	i am a fan of the movie and it is soundtrack . the movie is good but the soundtrack is actually better .
0	dear sir or madam , i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd . however , it must be good to use the right half of our brain , which is usually not used .

0	i would recommend this song to anyone . it make you feel better .
0	i am not a fan of the song i have heard from him . this one is a good song though .
0	i know it sound corny , but i have been waiting for year for this cd . how did the world miss out on this masterpiece ?
0	horrible annoying sound . i disliked this tremendously . i kept hoping the sound would change but wa just the same 10 second sound over and over .
1	a great song , a great video .
1	i love this song . i love the way a song is written , the music , the word , and what the artist is singing . i love the way christian sings this song .
0	i just purchased this cd because i wanted to hear a really good cd for a change . i wa completely blown away . it is a very good cd . it ha a really good feel to it . there are a few song on this cd that are very difficult to play , but when you get over that it is one of the better cd i have heard . i definitely recommend this cd . it is a very good cd .
0	another song that i have not heard in a long time and now i can . i have a feeling that it is a cover of a song written by a country artist . a cover of a song that is now being covered by a pop artist . i do not know what the hell is going on .
1	i think this song should be number one . there is no doubt in my mind that this is the greatest country song recorded . this ha a powerful , unique tune , with great lyric and a message that is timeless .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the
1	i have really enjoyed listening to this cd . i have purchased it for my daughter for her birthday , and i am enjoying the music a well .
0	this song had a bad effect on me .
1	i have been listening to this podcast for year . i feel like it is the only music podcast i can listen to without the need to turn it up . very informative and entertaining .
0	i do not know how to say this but i hate it .
0	this is an awesome song , but i am a little nervous listening to it .
0	i would not buy from this company again .
0	i will be getting more from brett young . he is a great artist .
1	i would heard this song for a while on the radio and decided to purchase it . the price wa right so i bought it .
0	this song is great , it just is not the best . it is just the worst to ever come out of this band . they could have had some pretty good song but they just did not .
1	i think this is one of the best song from this album . the guitar riff in this song is also the part that will always remind me of the i love you chorus from this song .
0	i downloaded this song twice and both time the lead singer channel had much le volume than the version i reviewed . almost like the right-left channel were not set the same . somebody need to have a look at the setting on this download .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
1	i am not a fan , but i do think this is a pretty good album . the song are well written , the lyric are amusing and the music is good if a little on the boring side .
0	in general i dislike live recording , for two reason . in an actual concert , audience are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day . no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control - a if that wa the artist last word on the music . this is grossly unfair , and review rarely acknowledge the difference , but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work .
0	this is definitely the best pearl jam album ever recorded . they did their best work yet .
0	
1	i love this album .
0	the song annoys me and i think it is a waste of my time . the song just make me want to smash my headphone .
0	i bought this album when the cd wa released . i thought i would like it . i listened to it and found it very boring . i would recommend you do not buy this album . there are better album out there you can listen to . the song are very generic and have no emotion . in fact , i have listened to this album on several occasion and have come to the conclusion that this cd is a waste of time . i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	i am a big fan of leon bridge . i love his voice . when i heard leon wa joining the eagle i wa very excited . i felt like he wa bringing his style into eagle . his voice is very unique , and i think that he had an excellent voice . the song i believe in you is one of the best leon bridge song . there is something about the feel and the way that he sings it that is very refreshing to me . the song is very good .
0	i have down loaded this two time . the song doe not work on my computer . i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon . they have refunded my money sometimes . but-why doe ten song down load & this one doe not !

1	i bought this album because i have always loved the beatles music . i enjoy this album because it capture the sound of the beatles a they were in their prime . i have bought this album at thrift shop , garage sale , and yard sale , but i always get the most for the least money . this album sound fantastic and is very easy on the ear . this is the most beatles album i have ever bought . i love the song and i think it is one of the best beatles album .
0	i have listened to this album for the last year or so , and it is the best album by rihanna .
1	this is one of the most amazing and musical album i have ever heard . it is like the beatles of the 80 . it is got some great song , some classic song and some great cover version of classic song . i love the way the song are arranged . the lyric are great , but the song are not the best , but the music is amazing . i am giving it 5 star , because i truly think this is one of the best album of the 80 .
0	this song is very different from anything i have ever heard . it is almost like a mash-up of a lot of different genre .
1	i agree with the other reviewer this is a good cd . it is a great cd . i hope it get a lot of play .
1	my wife bought me this album a couple of month ago . she is a big hank williams fan . i have to admit , this is my favorite hank williams album .

0	this is the most underrated song in the movie . it is actually a good song , but it is only played for a few second in the movie . it is great that it is in the movie , but i do not think it is necessary .
1	the song is perfect . i think it is a great song , especially the lyric . i always listen to music while i drive . this song wa on a playlist on my vehicle radio . i love the message behind the song , i am gon na keep on singing . good song !
1	this is the perfect song for worship .
1	this song is bad
0	i did not like this version of this song , but since this wa free , i guess i should not complain .
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song .
1	1. i need your lovin 4.24 2. drummer beat 5.20 3. let u turn it up 4.49 4. just feel it 5.19 5. y.e.a.h . 5.09 6. licensed operator 6.24 7. tease me 6.14 8. mind , body and soul 5.22 9. come back 2 me 4.42 10. aint no miss 5.02 11. sundress 6.11 12. i never knew 6.12
0	great mix of song . i have always loved blur and can never get enough of their song . this album prof why .
0	i have never been a fan of this song . i think it is silly to sing it . but it is a good song .
0	i love this movie and the soundtrack is great . it is definitely better than the movie .
1	this version sound great . it is a good song . i like it . i like it . i like it . i like this song . it is very good !
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility . many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long .
0	this is a bootleg release from dubious source . i have no idea why amazon even allows this to be listed , but do yourself a favor and save your money . there is no legitimate issue of this 2-fer . if you see this release , it is a bootleg .
1	i love this album ! i love the song !
0	this song is one of my favorite . i love the way he sings it , the feel of it , and of course the lyric . it flow well . i love this song and would recommend it to anyone . it make me happy .
0	so why are you asking me to review it ? this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer . stop pestering your customer to work for you without compensation by writing review !
0	this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever heard . sound like he wa drunk when he recorded this . even if someone gave this to me i would not want this in my collection .
0	i feel like a traitor saying this , but i will not be buying this set any time soon . i stand second-to-none in my affection for the band , but unfortunately , this career-spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 year of that recording career . by my count , there are only about five song on this set that were released after 1980. not good enough . capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered song , and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads .
1	i bought this cd . i thought it would be like $ 15 but it wa a $ 20 . it wa a mistake and i do not regret it . i really like the song , but i think the one i do not like the most are my savior and give me the beat boy . i would like to hear some other different song .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable .
0	i like this song a lot , but i am not a fan of the song . i think it is over done . it doe not do anything to help me feel good . i am always looking for song that make me feel good and this song doe not do that .
0	this is the only cd i have ever bought from amazon . it is the only time i have ever purchased anything from amazon . i can not say that i recommend it . i am not going to .
0	i do not like this song . i do not understand why tom and mark are singing it . it is very annoying . i am sorry , but this song make me feel really uncomfortable . i do not understand why tom and mark are singing this , and the other member just listen to it . i do not understand why tom and mark are singing this , and the other member just hear it . i do not like the lyric , and i do not like the song .
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
1	this is my all time favorite worship song , that is one i will sing everyday .
1	good song , but i would have liked more instrumentals in the album . the lyric were good , but i would have liked more instrumentals in the album . i would have liked the instrument to be a little more varied in the instrumentals .
1	i had a hard time with the end . the first disc is very good ! i wa very pleased with this one . i wa very happy with it . it wa a good song , but the end wa a little bit disappointing . i would recommend this to anyone .
0	this album is a lot of fun . but it could have been better
1	great ! just great ! one of my favorite track i have ever heard on the radio .
1	i really like this cd . it is very good .
1	i have purchased this cd and listened to it several time . i am very pleased . i have never been disappointed with any of the song i have purchased from amazon . this wa the best purchase i have ever made in my life .
1	this cd is worth purchasing . it is a great mix of music . it is a very good mix of music . it is a very good mix of music .
1	this album is absolutely fantastic . the song lyric are great . the music is fantastic . it just a great album . i never listen to pop music . it something new and fresh for me to listen to .
0	it is the most wonderful time of the year , and this song is a great reminder that there is always something to be thankful for .
1	this song give me so much inspiration whenever i need it . yolanda adam is one of the most talented and blessed gospel artist today .
1	i have not listened to this one yet , but i really like it . i wa really surprised to find it on amazon . i am a bit of a song junkie , too . after listening to it , i will probably buy it again .
0	no , this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since . this or that record . ( usually wheel on a gravel road , which everyone seems to worship ) and i wa really so disappointed because she a ) mumble b ) slur or c ) is not a good a she wa on car wheel . true , i have always liked lucinda . in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor , not always brilliant , but always heartfelt and sincere , providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country , blue and rock .
0	this can be a good cd , but it is not my favorite .
1	the first two album are great , i love that the band is touring , i love that i can listen to different artist and get a different view of them .
1	this is an awesome song . i love it . i like the lyric .
1	i have downloaded ton of rob zombie album and when this album came out i thought it wa weird that he did not know how to play the guitar . it is good music though . it is just weird that he doe not know how to play the guitar . i have not heard one rob zombie album that i loved . this
1	david gilmore is a great songwriter and performer . the combination of his talent and the amount of material he ha recorded make this cd a great addition to any david gilmore collection .
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship .
1	the lyric are good , but the song itself is a little boring .
0	this song ha a catchy chorus and a very good tune . the instrumentation is very good .
0	a fine album , but i am not the most ardent fan of this singer . the arrangement are great , especially the last two song , but he seems to have lost his way .
0	i do not understand why this album is not better . i have listened to this song 20 time and i have never get tired of it . i love the song . i thought this song wa a little bit better than the others on the album . i wish he would do another album like this . i love his song .
1	this is an excellent album . the best and most consistent album i have heard from the band in year .
0	this song is not very good . it is not very good at all . it is not very good at all . it is not that good at all . it is just boring .
0	i am a fan of this song . but it can make you feel like you are sitting in church . it is very pretty . it is also got a great message . if you were to listen to a radio station that had nothing christmas related , would you listen to this song ? i do not think so . i think this is a very good song . i like the vocal very much . it just get boring after a while . it is like a soap opera song , just with christmas music . i do not like soap opera music , but this one is okay . i can not really see myself singing it to my child .
1	this is a beautiful album that deserves the accolade it ha received . i am deeply honored to have reviewed this album . i am deeply honored to have reviewed this album .

1	i really love this cd . i am not normally a fan of sinatra , but i have to say this is my favorite .
0	i do not know how anyone can listen to this shit and not be disgusted by it . the song are terrible , the vocal are horrible , and the story is bad . there is no story . it is just horrible . i will never buy this record or any other thulian album . it is just a waste of time .
1	i really dig what they did with this cd .
1	a new song by the band featuring one of their own song . very good .
0	the lyric to the great gig in the sky are hilarious .

0	this is a fun song to listen to . i like it a lot .
0	i am not a fan of this song , but i like the lyric and the video . the song is very short . it is not for me .
1	? will not go on is the best and only reason to buy this cd . it is probably the only reason to buy a cd from amazon.com .
0	a very interesting , but not very exciting , cd . i can be selective about what i listen to . i know that in the past , i have not listened to the entire cd in one sitting . i like the vocal . the only problem is that it is not a good a the first cd . the song are just not a memorable a the first . i am disappointed in the production , but i have to admit i do like it . it is a little bit le polished than the first cd but it is still very good . i do like it .
0	this cd is crap . the band is mediocre at best . the drum sound like a really old drum machine . the vocal are horrible . it doe not matter how many of these song you listen to . it just will not be an in any longer .
0	i think this album is a good one . i like the song that are on here , but i think the lyric are the most annoying thing about the album . the lead singer ha a way of making the word sound like they are coming out of a movie .
1	i love this song . the music is amazing and the lyric are great . i just wish they would have put more instrument in the song .
1	this is an awesome album . i think i would have preferred the new version , a i did not like the original much . i love all of the song that are on this album . some would say it is the best that pink floyd ha ever done . i can not imagine a better album than this .
1	in a nutshell , a really good cd . the only problem is that there are no surprise on this album , which mean that in some case , you can find out a lot of thing about the artist . the vocal are good , and the music is good . i like the music i have heard on this cd . it is not the best , but it is a good start for a new artist .
0	for the most part , this is an enjoyable album , but doe not posse the same level of excellence that i had expected after reading the previous review . the song are excellent , but i have to say that this album is not a good a i had anticipated . and even the two song that are not included in the album , i am free and you are the only one are song that i would have greatly appreciated if they were included . the vocal are very strong and the lyric and music are excellent .

1	what a great song . the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus . the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness !
1	cincottis voice sound very different than bonnie tyler . he sings in the same key a bonnie , but the song is so different from bonnies that it is hard not to imagine that the two were recorded together . this ha a very good sound to it . i would say that it is very different from any other song that i have heard that ha bonnies voice . i would recommend that anyone who love this song give it a listen . it is a very good song .
1	i think it is great that they re-recorded this song because it sound kind of boring now . i miss natalie . i really like this song . it reminds me of her . i hope they put out more of her voice .
0	i thought the first couple of song were pretty , but after awhile the sound of the song just get annoying . the music wa good and i thought that they were just trying to go for a new direction , but after awhile it just get annoying and i do not even bother listening to their music anymore .

1	there is a lot of good music on this album . i really like the song . they are all really great .
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english .

1	this song started out a the theme song for the movie annie . it wa also one of the first song to be recorded by the group , the temptation . the song wa written by william mickey stevenson jr. and richard b. smith . it wa first released on the group 1967 album annie . the a-side of the original release wa a song called get ready . the b-side wa a song called i want to be yours . the song that wa the b-side wa originally called i want to be yours . the song wa then re-recorded with a completely different chorus and the melody wa changed to i want to be your fanny . the song wa then re-recorded with a totally different melody and a totally different chorus . the song wa then re-recorded with a completely different melody and a totally different chorus . it wa then re-recorded with a completely different melody and a totally different verse and a completely different chorus . the song wa then re-recorded with a completely different chorus and a completely different verse and a totally different chorus . the song wa then re-recorded with the same chorus and verse a the original , but a completely different chorus and a completely different melody . the song wa then re-recorded with a completely different melody and completely different lyric . the song wa then re-recorded with completely different lyric and completely different instrumentation and completely different instrumentation . the song wa then recorded with completely different lyric and completely different instrumentation and completely different instrumentation , but a completely different chorus . the song wa then recorded with completely different lyric and completely different instrumentation and completely different instrumentation , but a completely different chorus . the song wa then recorded with completely new instrumentation and completely new lyric . the song wa then recorded with completely new instrumentation and completely new instrumentation , but a completely different chorus . the song wa then recorded without the original instrumentation and lyric . the song wa then recorded without the original instrumentation and lyric .

1	i like all of the song on this cd . it is a good song . it is a good song . i have only listened to it for about two minute at most . it is a good song .

1	i did not know who she wa until i heard her sing this is who i am a few year back . i found her on youtube . i love this song . i am not sure why she wasnt on there but i love her singing .
0	seriously ? no wonder black people laugh at u . i think it is time white people ( and all musician for that matter ) start bringing actual musician ( for the generation who may not know what that is , it is people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument ) back into the recording studio . this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word . it give me elevator and walmart sense-memory . i do not even think this is good enough for a musak award .
1	this one is so soothing . i sleep well whenever i listen to it .
1	if you have a lot of record and you have a lot of music but not lot of time to listen to it , this is the album to buy .
0	i do not really like the arrangement on this album . the arrangement in the second and third song are weak and the vocal are just too weak .
0	it is a great song , but the band sound a little small . i also have a hard time separating the male and female voice . for instance , you might think one voice is male and the other female , but it is not . i think this song is great , but i think it could be a little better .
0	this album is pretty bad . i love this song . it is my favorite . i am a huge fan of the band , but this wa not for me . if you listen to the song shaking the heaven in the intro , you will know what i mean . not a lot of a song on this album . i mean , it could have been worse . it could have had a few more song on this album . but who care about the music ? i am about the lyric . the lyric on this song are very beautiful too . if you listen to the song shaking the heaven in it is intro , you will know what i mean . i am a huge fan of this song . i do not care who played this song . i think it is the greatest song . i could not have been more wrong . not only is the music bad , but the lyric are awful . i am not a fan of the band . i am going to go cry now . this is not even a good song . not even an okay song . i am very disappointed .
1	the beatles - sgt . pepper lonely heart club band i did not expect to like sgt . pepper so much , but the cd is awesome . i do not believe anyone could have written the song better .
0	this is a decent album , but the song are very bad . i do not recommend this album at all .
1	this album ha a wonderful sound throughout , and it is a very inspiring album from start to finish . it is very relaxing , and i could listen to it all night .
0	i could not download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time . however , thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free , i wa able to find the site bible.is . on that site they have the complete bible , plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized version of kjv , nasb , esv , and contemporary english . if this product did not need to be downloaded through cloud player , i would have given it a 4/5 star .
1	the original version of this song ha a very hard time getting airplay , but it is a very good song . my favorite version is on the album of the same name . this version is a much more laid back version of the song . i love the way he end the song with i will meet you in the sky .
0	i loved this soundtrack a a kid . a i wa growing up i never thought of it a a musical score . i wa just listening to the song a i wa watching the movie . i wa very excited to hear that there wa a sequel to this soundtrack , and i wa really pleased to find that it wa available on amazon . this will be my go to soundtrack for the rest of my life .

0	i love this band but the song they sing seem to be in italian . i am not an italian but i love italian music . i thought it wa funny that the one song i chose to listen to wa la damore by marconi . i do not understand what the hell they are singing . terrance wa great in the movie american pie , by the way .
1	really enjoy this album . i saw them at the boston center for the art and wa blown away .
1	i would recommend this album to anyone who want to listen to anything .
0	do not you think this song is a little bit too upbeat and happy ?
0	this is a great song . it is fun and ha a great beat . the song is also good to listen to when you are having a fun party at your house . it is also a great way to use some of your old song for a party .
0	oh please . whomever keep saying pearl jam is better than nirvana need to let up . pearl jam is worse than nirvana , yet i despise both . they both sold out . vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet , and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major . yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him . he had always been lazy , and nevermind reflects that . it is pure pop-rock on par with bon jovi , and he refused to admit it .
1	this track is perfect for the summer .
1	this song really is a great song , but the guitar solo is a little too much for me .
0	great album . great artist .
1	i like this album , but i want the radio version . it is better quality than the one on the radio . i like to listen to it when i am home . i have had it for a while and i still love it .
0	i like the vocal on this one . it is the one i like best on the album . i do not think i have heard anything like it from her . but , i am sure that is not the point . i like the song and the music . but , i am not looking for any new material from sheryl crow . i am just looking for a few of her favorite song that i can listen to again when i have free time .

0	this song is a great example of how a ballad can be used a a bridge in a song . the melody is great and the harmony is perfect . the only thing i do not like is that the lyric are a bit predictable . however , the performance is great and the song is worth it to listen to .
1	i have been hearing about this band for year and year . i finally got to see one of their show . it wa a great show . i love the music .
0	this is a good album but it is not nearly a good a some of their other album . their live show are great but this album is not a good a some of their other album .
1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music , it melody and lyric a well a it arrangement and performance , i find this cd one of the most beautiful recording of all-time . once again and a always , the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standard from the great american songbook . this cd will take u to a musical journey a we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music .
1	this song is great for falling asleep . i have played it since i wa a kid .

1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .

0	this is a great song . however , it is not my cup of tea . perhaps i am not the target audience .
1	this is the greatest cd ever made by the four top .
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept .

0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment , and i despaired of having a flawless product . the cd came through in perfect condition however . i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk . when i played the cd , i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection , so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk . unfortunately , i had to open the package in order to determine this , so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned !
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon . i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean . can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff . some of the rave review puzzle me . this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it . not trying to say jewel should stay confined but , just because record sale are lagging a bit , doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above ?

0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .

1	i bought all the cranberry song because they were on the radio . i bought them all because they are good . i bought them because they are good . i bought them because they are good . i like them . i like them .
0	i love this album , but i do not think anyone will listen to it . it is very good .
1	this cd is a great cd and you can see they are very talented and have a great voice .
0	this music is so bad . it sound like a man trying to play the guitar with his stomach . it sound like a man playing a trombone . i am not sure what the point of this song is . it seems to be a man playing a guitar that is stuck in his throat . it doe not sound like a man playing a guitar at all . it sound like a dog howling . it is so horrible i can not wait to listen to it again so i can scream it . this is a terrible song and i hate it so much .
1	i like this cd .
0	these two song are great . i do not like the sound of the song i would of bought them but i listened to them a lot . they are good song . i would not of bought them but they are good .
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
1	this is one of the best compilation of paul taylor song that i have ever heard . a great collection of song and great musician . this is a must have for any collection .
0	i really enjoy this album . it is probably the best zappa album i have ever heard . not a good a most people may think , it is still very good . i think that every song on this album is a great song . i really enjoy listening to this album , and i recommend it to anyone who like zappa . i think that this album is an excellent addition to any zappa fan collection .
0	this is jobims best album . i have listened to it over and over .
1	i heard the album two time and wa still surprised to hear an album a good a this . the band wa on top of their game . the best live show i have seen to date .
1	a really good version of this song . the song start with the line when the angel come marching down , and it build up to a really powerful ending , and i am sure this version is a great version of the song . it is good when you can sing along with the chorus , but the lead vocalist did not sing along to the song very well , but that is ok because he is a really good singer . the song is just a beautiful song so it is not a bad song , it is just not a great song . i recommend this song to anyone who want a really good version of a song . this is more like a gospel song but it is not bad .
1	i have heard this cd before and i have never really liked it , but this is a good cd . i can not really listen to it because i am really happy with it .
1	it is a great song . it is the perfect song to listen to when i am in a bad mood .
1	i have seen them many time and i have been a fan of oar since the late 60 . i have been to see them live on many many occasion . i have been a fan of oar for many year . this is definately one of the most important album to ever be released
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken-word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletiv e warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	this is one of the best song of this year .
1	i am so glad i found this album , and i am a rocker at heart . i do not care about the lyric or the music . it is great . i have heard enough rock crap from the mtv generation , thanks for the music that is actually good . and even if it happens to be written by a white male , or a gay male , or a black man , or a woman , or a man dressed a a woman , or a woman dressed a a man , or a gay man , . blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah . .
0	ive been living without the internet for the past few year . ive been using the internet but not really getting anything done . ive been enjoying the music , but i can not say that i have completely got over the music not downloading .
1	this is one of the best blue album . they just have too many song on this cd to be a collection of song , but this is a great album made from song . not all of the song on this cd are blue song , but all of them are really good .
1	when i fall asleep to this lullaby , i always sleep like a baby
0	i love this album , but it quality is not up to par .
0	this cd ha a lot of song that i like that are very similar to other song . i like the song on this cd because they are well written and very catchy . the only song that is really worth buying is the first song . the others are not so good and it is a shame that they are on a cd of this nature .
0	this cd feature the performance of the original version of the battle of new orleans performed by the new orleans symphony orchestra in 1945. the recording wa made by the new orleans symphony . it is a fine piece of history and great to hear but you have to buy it .
0	this album is a good representation of his songwriting . he doe not do anything too different and he ha a great voice . this is a good album to listen to if you want to hear some of his music .
0	this is an excellent album that should be played frequently . the song are so good , there is no way to stop listening to them .
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
0	in my opinion , it is the best album put out by the band monster of the universe . although the album is still a very good listen , the voice is a little too old now .
0	this version is a good version of the song . the vocal are good and the guitar sound great . the only thing i can see missing is the drum . i am not sure that this song deserves the rocker treatment , but it is a good version . it is a very catchy song and the chorus is a good one .
0	? - what the hell is that ? not sure what it is .
1	i like this cd but there are a lot
0	i never received my download it would never go to the music on my phone i want my money back bc i bought two copy of the song
0	lousy quality recording , you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it . i would also say it is best to listen to after 6 or 7 beer .
1	this album is really good , i love it and i think the fact that they are doing this album in a different sound and style is cool . also , every song on this album is really good .
1	phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio , jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum , along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga , and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans . all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well . jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd .
1	this album is a gift for my father and mother . it is the only album that they have purchased . it is a great album . the music wa perfect for my father and mother . it is very enjoyable . my mom said that she wa glad that she had been able to share this album with my father . this album is a great gift for the person who is looking for a gift . this album is a gift for my family . it will be with them for a long time . we really enjoy this album . we are very happy with all the music that we have received . we have enjoyed giving this album to my parent . yours in christ , tony and donna

1	it is a great concert . it wa a great show . the sound could have been better . they play some of their old hit but there are many more new song . they played some of their old hit but there are many more new song . the singer is great . the crowd wa great . the new song were great . i have seen them many time at the troubadour and the house of blue . i have seen them many time at the troubadour and had seen them many time at the
1	i am not usually one for singing along to music , but i love this song . they are still a great band - and i love that the band is still together .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
0	this is not the theme from enterprise . this is the same song , where my heart will take me , that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series .
0	i feel that the band ha made some of their best album . the album is very well done . it is a great album to give to your young child .
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five star im not sure if they are real people or work for three door down
0	this is a very poor performance . the song are all very average for the singer , and the vocal are not very good . this cd ha been very disappointing for me . if you are looking for a good cd that you can listen to over and over again , then this is not the cd for you .
0	i bought this cd and i love it . the first cd is great , and the second cd is great . the song are good , and the band is great . i recommend this cd .

0	very bad . i felt like i wa getting the same old crap , so i passed .
1	i have listened to this album probably 5 time since this morning . i have been a long time volbeat fan . these guy bring it all to the table with this album . trust me . get it ! now !
1	i love it .
1	i love the fact that this song is not so much about the war or war experience , but about the fact that the war experience is often temporary .
1	i am very impressed with this album . i think it is a very good album .
0	this is an awesome song , but i do not really like it .
1	a good tune , but the lyric are very slow . i like the tempo of the song and the song is really pretty . i like this song .
0	i really like this cd . it is a great album . it is like a really good collection of song by a band you already like . not trying to sound rude , but this is a band you already like . i do not know why people like to over rate album . i love this album . i think it is a great album .
1	i wa just looking at the song on pandora and decided to download it . i did enjoy it and the only thing that really bothered me wa that the guy singing took so long to get here could not get to the end of the song . i wa going to download it again , but i decided to just listen to it first and then decide . i thought the song sounded just a good a the original . it is the first song in this set that i know the artist is not a solo artist . his name is stephen marley and he is the main singer . the song is called iron bar and it wa released on his second solo album . i like it , but it doe sound a bit off because it is not a solo song and the production is a bit different . the original version wa released on iron bar and it is an acoustic version . this version is a studio recording . i guess i am just not sure i would want to listen to this version . the production is a bit different so it doe not sound a good a the original . i would think more people would like the original . i would guess that this version of this song wa recorded after the original and is a bit higher budget . i would think this version would be more suited to the acoustic sound . i would guess that it would be more suited to the acoustic sound . the original wa recorded with a live band and this version is recorded with just the two singer and a piano . i would guess that the piano would be the reason why the song sound so different . i think the piano would make the song sound a bit more live . you get the idea . i am not sure why i am writing all of this , but what i am writing make even le sense than the song itself . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not like this version of this song . i would like to hear the original . i would like to hear a better version of this song . i am not sure why i am writing this , but i have decided to just listen to this song and decide later on if i like it or not . so , i am just going to listen to the song . is that okay ? i guess i am just trying to say that i do not like the version of this song that is on the album . i do like the original . i would prefer to hear the original version of this song . i would prefer to hear a better version of this song . i am not sure what to think of this song . i am not sure why i am writing this . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not think this version of this song is good . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not mind hearing this version , but i do not like the version that is on the album . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not know why i am writing this , but what i am writing make even le sense than the song . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not care about the version of this song that is on the album . i am not sure why i am writing this . i am not sure what to think of this song . why am i writing this ? i guess i am just trying to say that i do not care what song is on the album . i am not sure why i am writing all of this . i like the version that is on the album . i like the version that is on the album . i am not sure why i am saying this . i guess i am just trying to say that i do like the version that is on the album . i like the version on the album . i am not sure why i am writing this , but i am writing this to tell you that i do not like the version on the album . i am not sure why i care at all about what song is on the album . i am not sure why i care . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not want to hear the version on the album . i am not sure why i am saying this , but what i am saying make even le sense . i guess i am just trying to say that i do not really care what song is on the album . i am not sure why love you is on the album . i guess i am just trying to say the song is on the album . i am not sure why i am typing . i am just trying to say that
1	i never heard this one before but i am glad i do . i think it is a good song . have you ever felt like you have been run over by an oncoming train ? i have . when i wa a kid i had dream of being a singer , a performer , a singer , a singer , a singer , a singer , a singer , a performer , a singer , a singer , a singer . i went to the music store after school ( which wa a 3 mile walk ) and asked the guy there if they had any old record i could buy . he said , you can buy any record you want , but you will never find a song like this . it is a song that no one ha ever written . it is a song that no one ha ever sung . i bought it the next day . i have not seen it since then . it is been a very long time . it wa the only piece of music that ever made me feel like i had a place , an identity , a voice , a place in the world .
1	i have listened to this cd for a week now and it still sound like the beatles . they have a great sound . it take a lot of work to get the beatles sound in a cd . this cd is a must-have for beatles fan like me .
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
0	i like the cd and the music is really good .
0	i have never purchased an album before that wa not a hank williams , jr. record . i am glad to have found this album . it is a fantastic album .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
0	i am very dissapointed
1	this is a really good album . i wa pleasantly surprised . it is not a pearl jam album that you would expect to be a great album , but it is a good a i have seen them do . this album is probably not for everyone . it is too similar to the sound they had , but it is a lot better than what you would expect after the last couple of album . the only bad thing about this album is that it is too short . they could have made it longer by adding 2 or 3 song . another thing i really enjoy about this album is that it is a lot more varied than what i have seen them do before . the song are a little shorter , but that doe not matter . it make the album a lot more enjoyable .
0	i am glad i bought this cd . i have a huge problem with my father in law who is a very intelligent man but when it come to music , he just doe not get it . i have a lot of respect for him and his musical knowledge but he is really not into the music genre that i like so i bought this album but i feel like he really need to learn to appreciate music .
1	not to many people are aware of this album , but this is a great album . the album is great and you can really tell from the album cover that this is a great album . if you like rock and roll , this is a great album to listen to .
1	this is my second adam lambert album and i love it .
1	i have listened to a lot of this song and i love it . i do not know that i am going to purchase it , because i like the original version more .
1	i mean seriously , if you do not know and love this song , you either should not be listening to the door or something is wrong with you . i know it college music these day , but all the same .
0	the only bad song on the album is the one i love , and i admit that one . i like the other song very much . the album is very good .
1	this song ha a good message .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
1	this is a great song . i did not like the album a a whole .
1	i wish to say that this cd is better than the one on the cd . the song i liked better on the cd are on this one . but i am glad i have a cd to listen to .
0	no offense meant to anyone who like this disc , but it is quite a boring record . loved the guitar playing , though . i am sure there are some good song on the cd , i just did not like it all that much .
1	i love it . it is the best song on this album . i really like it .
1	i like this song , it is very worshipful and make you feel like you are going to be born again . this song is very inspiring and help you to worship god .
0	this song is incredible ! i love the vocal !
0	
1	i wa able to listen to this album on my iphone . the quality is excellent .
1	i like many l.o.b.o.s song - they are fun and have a catchy melody . i do not like the fact that there are not many live song on this album . after listening to the first few album the song are more like a compilation of song that were released in the 90 . but this is only a minor complaint . overall , this group is one of the best group of the 90 . their song are fun and i like how they are able to go off on their own on many of the song .
1	i love this album . i bought it because i wa looking for something new and different . i listen to this album daily and i love it .
0	not worth the wait or the money . if i want some foreigner to preach to me about politics and the state of the world i will turn on the any of the left owned television station or read the slanted truth on the internet . i will be throwing mine in the trash could not sit though 3 song . please stop shoving you political view down our throat and start to entertain with some great music .
1	i think this song is one of the most powerful track on the album . thank you for a wonderful , and very moving , song .

1	i am a big fan of the band and i love this album . i am a big fan of the band and i love this album .
1	sound clear and no disappointment in quality . i am very happy with it and love the song . go for it !
0	i wa told this wa happy music . i find it boring & depressing . i am tossing it .
1	i really loved this song . i have loved lucinda williams for a long time . i still listen to her work everyday . i love how the sound of her voice is so unique and different . it doe not sound like anyone else . the song is different every time you listen to it . this one is very different from the last two that i have listened to . i think it is amazing .
0	this song reminds me of a time when i wa around the age of twelve and i wa really into country music .
1	i am not going to tell you what the song is about , but it is an ode to the beauty of life and the beauty of love . also , it seems to be a reference to the song i am in love by james taylor .
0	a great album . this album is better than the real thing . i love the energy of this band and i think they can do better . i love the energy !
1	i am a fan of this band and i love their music . this song is so funky and groovy . i love that it ha a beat but it not hard . it just fun to dance along to . this band is really good .
0	this song is amazing ! just amazing ! the only thing that i do not like about this version is that i do not like it too much . if you like the original one , then you will like this .
0	this album is a complete waste of time . the song on this album are all about how i hate the band . i have listened to this album more than 20 time and i have never get tired of it . i am not the type of person who care if you like the band or not . i am not a fan of the band . i think they really missed the boat on this album . they should just give it up . it is all a waste .
0	i like to pick out 3 song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program . i can not find 1 here . just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal . almost every song is overplayed . talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road . recalculating ! weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd . they can surely play but need some serious direction . will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid .
1	i love this album ! it is great !
0	a very good album . i really enjoyed it . the production is excellent . it is very exciting to hear a little bit of beatles music . it is a great album . i recommend it for anyone who love beatles music . the sound quality is very good .

0	i have been a fan of johnny cash for about 25 year . i love this song , it is my favorite johnny cash song . i think this is my favorite johnny cash song of all time . i have been listening to this song for about four year now . i have listened to this song for about four year now . i am still loving it . i still love it . i think this is my favorite johnny cash song .
0	the chorus is so generic that it is very hard to tell if it is a cover or not . the instrumentals and the instrumentals in the background are excellent . the vocal are okay , but i do not think this is a song .
1	this is the best song by fall out boy !
0	- i think that the song is ok. i just did not connect with this song a much a i should have . the lyric are just a big joke and the singer is annoying . the singer wa the only thing that stood out to me .
0	this cd is a must have for any dylan fan and i think dylan fan would be happy with the song on this album . it is a classic album of music , and although it may be hard to hear some of the song , i think that it is a must have for dylan fan . this is an amazing cd .

0	i really like this song and wish she would go back and do another song like this one .
0	i do not know much about this song other than it wa
1	i have been listening to this song for a while now . very good song , and well written .
0	i thought this wa pretty cool . i downloaded it because i heard a guy say that it wa one of his favorite . i do not normally download music , but i wanted to try it . i thought it wa a cool song , and i like the song , but maybe it is too early for me .
0	just another bad dylan album .
1	i bought an mp3 for my wife and she really liked it .
1	i have this cd and am very happy with it . it is a very good addition to any zappa fan collection . i really like the album , and many song stand out to me . i think that this album is very good , and ha some great song that you will not want to miss . while there are some song that are not that good , there are still a few that i think are very good . for example , i really like stupidity of crowd and the nail .
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
0	this is almost exactly like i gotcha by the 5th dimension . i really like the song but i think it is a little too similar to i gotcha and it doe not really stand out enough .
0	this guy is terrific . however , this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content . every song on one is on the other in the exact order . and i bought both thinking they would be different . really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title . great performer . probably a decent guy . but let u take one of those off the market ! it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky .
1	wow ! this is great stuff . i have yet to find another band with the same musical talent a this . i love the band . it is a great album . i love this band . i love this band . i love this band .
0	i bought this for my 8 month old and she is not impressed by it at all . she much rather listens to the radio . guess i could have saved the money
1	i like this album it is great . i am 10 year old and i love this album . all of the beat are really great and the lyric are really great and 50 cent is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause it is so good . this is what rap music is all about , really good beat and really good lyric and really good rapping . 50 cent is the best rapper ever , i listen to this cd every day after school while i am eating my snack pack and watching sister sister on the wb .
0	this is one of the best live album i have heard . but i did not get it until it wa on blu-ray , so maybe that is why there is so much good stuff on it .
1	this is not a bad album . i do not think it is a great album , but i would not say it is a bad album either . it is a good album ,
1	
0	this is another case where le is more . i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting . instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa caught in a deluge .
0	i love the music and i do not care who she really is . i want to buy this cd .
1	this song ha some good guitar work .
0	i have the new seed cd by the hooter . it is a very good cd , but i am not going to recommend this on this forum .
0	this album is all bad song and it is not worth listening to . you will feel like you are listening to a shitty band . like , i would rather listen to the song in too deep again than read the lyric . it is like you are listening to a bunch of boring white people singing about white people singing about having sex . i think it is just supposed to be a joke , but it is not funny . for real , there is no story here .
0	a collection of my favourite song . great song and i am truly grateful to you for making them available to u all . once again , thank you !
0	a fine cd , but i am afraid that it is going to be a long story to hear another tso album . i am not , but i think some song are not worth the price .
1	this is awesome .
1	got this song in my head after watching true detective on tv , so i had to buy it !
1	i love this cd .
1	i love stryper and have listened to them on and off for year and this is the best album i have heard from them . the first stryper album wa my favorite and i agree with the other reviewer .
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music - and i have not yet heard all of her 1990s-era release ( because they are a little difficult to find . ) but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s fall into the pop and light jazz genre , i get the impression that for hetero her manager ( or producer , whatever , ) wa trying to nudge her into alt-rock , that tane herself wa more interested in .
1	i like this version of the song . i did not like the original , but i like this version a lot . it is a very good performance . it is close to the original , but not quite a good .
1	i love this album , but i want the radio version . the quality is better . not a perfect album , but a very good album . i would listen to it again .
1	if you like folk , folk rock and classic pop , this is a hit ! i did not really care for it , but most people will find it to be a hit .
1	this cd is definitely a step up from the last album . this is a great album for country lover . this cd is a great addition to anyones collection . the song are all very authentic and are very well written . i would recommend this cd , but only to serious country music lover .
1	i love this song and group ! it brings back memory of my youth . thanks for having this song for me to purchase .
0	when i wa a little girl , i used to sing song by the beatles on the piano to my parent . this album is the perfect soundtrack .
1	this album is a very good one . i would recommend it to a fan of zaba , who is looking for a zaba album to introduce them to the music .
0	the best christmas album in my opinion . there is a lot of variety , and the song are all good .

0	! one of the best track of 2008 .
1	this is actually a great song . i am truly a died hard fan for k. michelle so i do not mind keeping it real . it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record . she ha always recorded break-up record and album , and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new . she is crazy , sometimes rude and take thing to the extreme , but one thing that is true is that she can sing ! support real music and trust she will deliver .
0	a good cd . it is not the best . the song are not too interesting , and the vocal are not a good a i would expect .

1	this will be the first song of my life that i have to play over and over again .
1	this album is the perfect balance of the band past and the future . it ha all the element of the band best work , but ha not been played on a regular basis for over a decade . i would recommend this album to anyone who like pop-rock/metal with some pop in it . it is not the most original thing , but i like that it ha the element of the band best work and still ha enough that make it enjoyable . it is definitely worth the listen .
1	i purchased this album on a whim . i wa surprised at how good it wa . the music is very unique , and the lyric are very memorable and meaningful . the cover is pretty cool , too .

0	i have listened to this album a number of time . most of the song are good , but there are some really weak one , and some really not so good one .
1	this is without a doubt , one of the most brilliant and original album i can ever remember hearing . this is some of the best music i have heard in my entire life . i can listen to this album over and over .
0	most of these are only portion of the song , such a 1 verse and the chorus . i would prefer the entire song . also , many are done with a country feel to them , not the traditional music you would hear in church . i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with , and it is not a hit . wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i-tunes wa 3 time the price .
1	this is a really interesting song . i wa surprised to see that the original is just the first two chord and that her guitar playing is so good .

0	this album is a fantastic listening experience . it is a great way to relax and unwind . the only negative thing i can think of about this album is the song selection . i believe the original joe augustine album are better .
1	this song really make you want to dance .
1	this is great , but it is not my cup of tea .
0	again amazon.com did not download my purchase . this is not the first time but it is the reason i do not keep or alow amazon.com software or cooky on my computer . amazon.com ha used them to erase kindle book . that wa the greatest act of malicious malware i have ever come across . so now i eliminate all software , ie , the amazon.com music player , and the amazon.com cooky both of which were use in the malware attack on my kindle library . when amazon .

0	this is my second album with adam . the first one wa good , but not a good a this . this album is very well produced , and it flow well .
0	i really like the song , but i do not like the song . i do not get why tom and mark are singing this , and the other member just listen . i do like the lyric , but i do not like the song .
1	i really like this song a whole lot . the only thing that i would disagree with is that this song is too long . i would recommend listening to this song for at least three time before you say it is too long . the song is great and the lyric are great a well . i would give the song a 9.5/10 .
0	i listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical piece .
0	her voice is not the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive line . i would like to hear her sing this song with the help of a different backup band , arranger and composer .

0	this song rock , but .
1	this cd is a collection of original music that wa written for television . each track is an hour long . this cd contains three soundtrack that were created for television , so they are not all song . however , they all contain a lot of good music , and the track are all well written and sung . these are not the oldie song you have grown up with . there are some older song , but a lot of these are by well known composer . it is a very good collection of new music .
0	this is one of my favorite album . the song do not come closer had a good beat , but i wish it wa a little longer .
1	this collection is an amazing collection of song from the 80 , 90 and the 00s . all the hit , all the classic , all the song you have ever wanted to hear again .
0	the song is not the same a the tracklisting .
1	i really liked this cd . the cd is very well done . the album wa very well made and the music wa great .
1	i think it is a great album . it ha a great mix of rock and roll tune . i have listened to this album for several month and i love it . it is one of the best album i have purchased in a long time .
1	this is the best album i have ever heard . it is a must-have !
0	this is a really bland collection of song . i can not recall why i have never heard this before .
0	definitely not his best work . song either to rap or slow . nothing like his last 2 album . it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
0	i am a big fan of this artist , i first discovered her work by listening to her song love you madly .
1	this album is great . this is a good album . it ha good music , it ha good message , and it ha good lyric . this album is great . i love this band . i love their music . they are good . i love this band .
0	i really enjoyed this movie , but i do not think the soundtrack wa a good a the movie .
1	i have been a fan of this band since they first came about . they are one of those band that can get lost in your collection and you have to listen to them again and again .
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
1	this song wa amazing . the whole album is amazing .
1	
1	this brings me back to my younger year - my college day when ll wa still my boo : - ) i have grown up since then but i still love this song .
0	this album could almost be a jazz album and might be a good one , but the lyric are not very good
1	the only way to describe this cd is a a complete waste of time . if you are a fan of the original how the grinch stole christmas , then you might enjoy this album . if , however , you are a fan of the recent animated version , then you will not enjoy this album . i do not know what the point of this piece of crap is . it is a complete waste of time . i hate it . it is a terrible piece of crap . it make me sick to my stomach . it should be thrown away . i do not have time to listen to it , and i certainly do not want to . if you like the animated version of how the grinch stole christmas , then you will love this piece of crap . just do not waste your time with this garbage .
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
1	this is a good song . great for any occasion . i think it wa written by one of the greatest artist of all time .
0	this song just reminds me of can not take my eye off you by the 5th dimension , and i like it just a little bit .
0	this song is really good , it make my skin feel nice and soft .
1	the sound quality is great . the song is very good . i love the iron man song . i love this song . i would recommend this to anyone .

0	i have a cd of this song and i love it . i have seen this song on tv , on the internet , in movie , and on the radio . this song is so true to life and the story that is told in the book . i wish i had this song when i wa a kid .
1	this song is sooooo good . i love it . i love it . i love this song . this song is sooooo good . i love it . i know i have said this before .
1	shinedown being shinedown at their best ! similar yet very different from all their other offering ! keep it up gentleman !
1	this is the song that got me into jewel , and i love it !
1	i think i like this version better than the other one because the band played it so well and the horn and string were not to intrusive .
1	i would recommend this album to everyone who want to listen to christian rock music .
0	great album . i feel like i just got a great album . very good vocal . i really like the song , even though some of them are not my favorite . it just sound like a good album .
1	
1	a very nice version .
0	major disappointment . always been a huge bh fan from way back . the songwriting is trite and uninspired . take no chance musically . dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement he is trying to make with the title track . utterly forgettable album .
0	i think this album is just like rob zombie other album . it is good and ha some good song . i think this album is just like rob zombie other album .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
0	when i read the title of this cd i thought it wa like a movie that i wanted to go see , but i did not . i wa really disappointed . i do not like this music . the lyric are stupid and there is just not enough emotion in the music . this is a nice cd , but not worth a trip to the movie or any place like that . this is just average .
1	the grateful dead is one of the greatest live band of all time . they are one of the best band in the world !
0	great album . great mix of song .
1	i did not know this band , but their music wa great . i like their music very much . their song are very good . i like how they have a real different sound .
1	i really like this album . i do not know why but my favorite song on it is do not come closer . i love how the song ha an underlying rhythm , which make it so different from other song with a similar concept .
0	
0	this song is awesome , but i can not help but to find it annoying .
0	i am a huge fan of the beatles music , and i think this is one of the best album of the six beatles . the production is very good . the song are very catchy .
0	i love the song , i am not a fan of the song . the lyric sound like they were forced on me . it make me feel really embarrassed to listen to the song , and the only reason i have kept it is because i have listened to the song a couple of time .
0	there is a lot of hype behind this cd , but i am still amazed at how poorly it sound . a lot of people are going to hate this cd , because it sound like they are listening to the worst of the worst that they can find . i do not mean to be harsh , but this release is nothing more than a waste of time .
0	wow ! prince is so good that you can really feel his passion . i have listened to his entire discography over and over without repeating any of them . i wish i would have known him when i wa younger . i would have loved to have gotten to know him .
1	i have been a fan of the band for a long time . this is a great song . this is a great song . this is a great song , i love this song , this is a great song . this is a great song , this is a great song . this is a great song . this song is a great song . this is a great song . this wa one of the best song i have ever heard . i love this band . i love this song . this is a great song .
0	this is one of the song that i have had my niece sing to me . she like to sing along to this one . it is a very happy song and i have had her sing it to me a number of time . it is not very difficult to learn , but you will have to work hard to learn it . this is a good listen .
0	this is just another one of those cute love song that we have heard a million time . i have no problem with the lyric , but the vocal are just plain annoying .
0	this ha to be the most pointless tribute album to syd barrett .
0	jonathon is a great musician , who is song are well-crafted song with a good flow .
0	i am sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage , in flame , a i lay dying , lamb of god , ect . now thats real music . not this crap . the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot nine time . in a few year rap will die just like disco . then metal will rule the world once again .
0	i can tell you that this is the only one of their album i own . i like it but wish it wa a bit more like the other fleetwood album .
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . however , the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face ) . i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters .
0	i like this album , but it is too low quality .
0	i really enjoyed when i got this cd but i do not like it . i am a big fan of the beatles and i really enjoy hearing the beatles play this for about the last four minute there is just something about it . i am not a big fan of the beatles but i think this is a great album . i do not get all of the song on it but i love the beatles .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	this is one of the best song of the year .
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved .
0	this album ha some very good song , but it is not a very original one . and it is a little boring .
0	this album is one of my all time favorite . the selection is great , and the sound is excellent . i am especially fond of the song i feel fine and for you blue . this cd is certainly worth buying .
1	i listen to this cd every day . all day . i absolutely love this group . i get inspired and motivated . feel good music by a family-group that can really sing !
1	i feel sorry for the guy . he ha a young girlfriend , and the video show the two of them having a good time . however , he is still single , and now he is seen the video . he is seen the video , and he is been in love , and he just can not get over it .
0	oddly amusing song . wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger . lyric for the younger audience , good beat !
1	this is my favorite cd that i have ever owned . i received it from my brother-in-law and i have listened to it every day since i got it . it is so good ! i love the way it ha music in it and i love the music that is in it . it make me happy . every time i listen to it i feel good . it ha many great song in it . it ha many great song . i love this cd . i have listened to it for 5 day . it is good . it is a good cd .
0	i am amazed at the amount of positive review on this album . it is the worst album ever made . it is the worst , worst , worst album ever made . it is the worst , worst , worst , worst , worst , worst , worst , worst , wackest , worst , worst album ever made by a man .
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music . what happened to free ?
0	this is a great song . i like the song . i would give it a 10-out-of-10 . i have not heard this cd in awhile and this is my first jewel cd . i am disappointed in this cd and the song . i am really disappointed in this cd . i really do not like jewel voice .
0	this ha to be the worst holiday song ever made . i can not believe anyone would actually pay for this . i would not even download it for free .
0	i heard this cd on christmas morning and bought it after i got home .
1	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i had heard from the dvd . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud .
0	i love this song . it wa a great summertime song when i wa a kid . i have tried to listen to it while driving , but i have not been successful . it is a great song .
0	i am a big fan of lucinda , but i am not sure if this is her best work . it is good . it is not great . it is good .
0	this song is awesome . i thought it wa going to be like the original . i like the way the bass line play , and the drum . i love the song itself , i do not know why i did not like it . i just thought it wa going to be like the original . i really loved the original . i would like to hear someone play it .
1	this song make me feel happy and loved . i really like the lyric and the music . i really like the word in the song . it is a very good song . i am glad you enjoyed it .
0	i would have to tell you to stick with the music of lou reed and john zorn , and do not listen to any of the other stuff that come out . the music of lou reed and john zorn is timeless and always will be .
1	the reason i bought the song wa because the
0	the new album from the band ha been compared to radiohead and coldplay . i am not sure what it sound like .
0	if you are a die-hard fan of the who , this album will take you to another level . this is not a bad album , but i do not think it is a great album . it is definitely a very personal album , and i believe it is an album that will appeal to fan of the who . the only real problem i had with this album wa the constant change in the vocal style . my favorite song ha to be i am a man . i am a huge fan of the who , and i think this album is very good . i listen to this cd and the other cd on the cd version . the cd version is much better than the cd version on my ipod . the sound quality on the cd version is much better than my ipod .
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album . it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out , and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet . you could not turn the tv on without seeing him or this record . however , there were only 3 or so song that i liked . the other song just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me . this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric , but maybe the producing .
0	did not sound a good a it did in bourne identity !
0	i had a set of three beach boy album and a box set , and i wa very disappointed . the three album were well-executed , but the box set is simply inferior to the others . they are all excellent , but the box set is the worst . there are several song that i wouldve paid more for , but there are also several song that are simply awful .
0	i love this album ! this is one of my favorite . it ha a lot of good song . the song have a lot of energy to them . it ha some ballad . it ha some great song that i enjoy . and , they are all written by a different person . i have been a fan of theirs for a long time .
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
1	the best live album i have ever heard .
0	i have listened to this album quite a few time and i still do not think it is worth buying . the song are good , but the album is really nothing more than that . i would rather listen to one of the other album that are out there . the song on this album are repetitive , the song on this album are not original . it is not a bad album , but it is not worth buying .
0	i like the song , but i do not like the way it sound . it sound like a lot of reverb and echo . i do not like the way this song sound . and i do not know why i like this song so much . i like this song , but it just is not a good song . it is not a great song , it is not an average song , and it is not a good song . i do not know why i like this song so much . i bought it to help me get over my depression , but it is too much like other song that help me get over my depression . i do not know why this song work for me . i would love to find a song that is like this one , but it just is not a good song . i hope that the song will come back into production . i do not have a lot money to spend , but i do feel that i should try to get a song that will help me get over my depression .
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if feeling between two people had been in sync .
1	this album should be played at all the live show and concert . it ha so many great song and it is all amazing .
1	i have this cd , and have listened to it several time . it is full of great song . i think i will purchase another copy soon .
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk .
1	this is a wonderful album . it ha some good song , but some song on the cd are just plain boring .
1	this song is a perfect song for 1st grader . the song is very easy to sing with . this is a perfect song for 1st grader because it is a very simple song with a perfect melody and lyric . it is a very good song for people who love the beatles .
1	i wa very excited to hear this song , but when i started to listen to it , i realized that it wa a little boring . all the lyric and everything are great , but i feel like the tune is just a bit flat . it doe have a good tempo .
1	great song . i like it very much .
0	i bought this so my brother and his girlfriend could listen to it . they liked it .
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past 30 year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album . like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy . these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist ( robert lamm , terry kath , and peter cetera ) however , a most fan know , the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty .
1	this cd rock . it rock like a 4 top .
1	this is an awesome album . the music is very good . i like it . i would recommend it to anyone who like jazz .
0	i like this christmas song very much . the only thing i would change is that i wish the song wa longer . i like the song .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
0	this cd is a great cd . i love the song . they are easy to understand and i love the variety of the song and the different instrument that are used . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	i heard a lot of hype when this album wa released . i thought that i had heard it before but wa wrong because it is not a reissue from the early 80 . instead of the heavy metal sound of the 80 , the original sound wa very soft and laid back .
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect .
0	barefootin wa on there , which is not the song we were after . we wanted let go baby , which wa supposed to the b side , but instead it wa mountain of love by harold something or another . it came from a series of collectible .
0	if you are looking for something to help you sleep , this is not it . the 30 second preview here sound peaceful ( and almost hypnotic to me ) but the full version ha some strange element . a the other reviewer said , it doe have a lot of static . it sound like . popping noise , or something to that effect . very strange .
0	i have seen them a few time now and i can not tell the difference between them and the other band . they sound great !
1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once .
0	this album is excellent and is a must have for all bluegrass music lover .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . every song ha a great hook and is memorable . i have always liked this band and i love their song . the production is great and the lyric are great . this is my favorite album of all time . i would recommend this album to everyone . - diggity lizard
1	i absolutely love this soundtrack . i love the movie . it wa a great soundtrack to the movie . i have seen this movie a couple of time . it is a very good movie .
0	i can not believe how great the band is ! i am glad that i have heard them a a teenager and have not lost my faith in them . this is the best clash album i have played in year : the clash are dead i can not get it out of my head . i had never heard the song before . i had never even heard of them . but , i love the song . it make me cry .
1	i love this song , it is so beautiful . so sweet .
0	i thought this song wa very good . i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	this is so simple and easy to listen to . it is very simple to listen to . it is also a great way to use some of your old music in a party . it is also a good way to use some of your old song in a party to help a cause .
1	i like this song . it is a great song . it ha a great beat . the lyric are nice . the horn are a nice touch . i like this song .
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent , in which sound engineer over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder , but damaging the dynamic range . this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war . it ha plagued manyremasters including nine inch nail 2010 remaster of pretty hate machine , and subsequent release of classic beatles record . the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency .
1	if you are looking for a gift from god , this gift is for you . god gift are not limited by time or space . they are endless . so , god ha given me this gift for you . i want to give you more than this cd . but , i can give you all that i have . jesus christ is the ultimate gift . he is eternal . no matter where you are , he is there .
0	i do like this song because it ha a great beat . i really like that it start with one note and change to the next .
0	it is not a bad album on it is own , but the song are really not good either . the one you enjoy the most on the album are i got life , good time , so good , and diary the other one are ok , but nothing exceptional . the production is nice , but the music is kinda corny , and boring . i recommend this album if you like the classic or rock song .
0	i wanted to buy this because i thought it would be a great addition to my collection . i wa not disappointed . most of the song are pretty straight forward but there are a few that are great . the first one i listened to wa shake your body ( down ) , which is awesome . i like the sound of the bass , the riff and the drumming . the rest of the song were ok , nothing special and a little repetitive . i would not suggest this disc to anyone looking for new music for their collection .
0	natalie is getting too old to write music that is good . we all need a break at some point in life . we have to grow up and stop creating music . she is getting too old to be writing music that is good and ha to take a break .
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can not say it is typical , but it is soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefer mks version .
1	this is one of the more interesting album . there is nothing about it that is bad and i can not wait to hear this album again . if this is the best dylan album , then i have to say that dylan is much better than elvis and much better than johnny cash . dylan is better than paul mccartney . this is a very good album . dylan is much better than elvis and much better than johnny cash . i also like the beatles . this is one of the best album ever . this is one of the best album ever .
0	i don ’ t like this song . i do not like it very much .
1	i really like it . i do not believe in christmas song . i can not remember the last time i heard a christmas song . i do not know . i bought this cd because i thought it wa a christmas cd . it is . i love it . i think you can buy this cd , too , if you like christmas music .
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
0	the best of all time , for me .
1	i like it . it ha a nice melody and ha good harmony .
1	this song ha been on my heart for some time . it a great song .
1	i bought this album on cd because it wa in my collection . i love this band and am really glad i bought this album . it is such a great record . they have a great style and their new album sound great . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i love it , but i am not a fan of this song .
0	this song is great , but i do not think that this song wa made for the ipod . it wa made for people like me , who just do not get it , because it is not the type of music that make me feel the way that i want it to make me feel . even if you can not get it , i can not imagine not having it . it is my favorite song of the year .
0	i would like it better if it wa slower , more mellow , and with more of a chill feel to it .

1	i just want to say that this is the best album i have ever had the pleasure of owning . i love this album and it ha changed my life . a a matter of fact , this album is very special to me because i have been having problem with my wife and child . since i have been listening to this album i have been able to relax with my family and it ha been very good . i have also been able to get my wife to relax and we have become friend . this album ha made me smile . this album ha made me happy . this album ha made me feel good . this album ha made me a better person . this album ha made me a better person . this album is great . i am very happy with this album . i am very happy with this cd . this album is fantastic . this cd is a very good album . this cd is a very good album . this cd is great . this cd is awesome . this cd is awesome . this cd is fantastic . this cd is excellent . this cd is a good cd . this cd is a good cd . this cd is a great cd . this cd is a great cd . this cd is excellent . this cd is fantastic . this cd is awesome . this cd is great . this cd is fantastic . this cd is fantastic . this cd is great . this cd is great . this cd is excellent . this cd is excellent . this cd is great . this cd is great . i am very happy with this cd . this cd is great . this cd is great .
0	this song wa supposed to be a good number one hit . so i wa very happy to find this song in the top 10. this is a good song . the song ha a great beat . it ha a catchy chorus . i wa expecting a good song . the song is pretty clean and it ha some good instrumentation . the song ha a great riff . the song is a good song . it is got a good beat , it is got some good instrumentation , and it ha a really catchy chorus . this song could be a good song , but it is not . i think that this song is a good song , but it just doe not have a lot in common with the other song on the album .
0	it kept me in shape reaching for the next tune button . the dodo have 2 song that i listened to all the way to the end , all the rest were just too pathetic .
1	i like this song . i do not know who made this song but it is catchy and the lyric are beautiful . this wa my first time hearing this song and i love it !
0	this cd is nice and ha good vocal and good guitar playing .
1	this song is very well done and well produced . i am glad to know that there is a recording out there of this song .
0	these were great . the first one is so good . i love the music and the fact that the guy can sing . the second one is just about the same , but seems to miss the point , but still is a great song . but still , no sound . so disappointing . i guess i have to buy both , i guess that it is worth it .
1	great song i have always love that song
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i love the music .
1	this is the best album of the 90 . the lyric are great and the music is very good . i love this album .
0	i downloaded this mp3 after hearing it in an at & t commercial . i like the song , but the mp3 sound absolutely awful . it is just way too compressed . so it is extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range . almost unlistenable . i honestly do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp3 encoding . 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate , and i have plenty of mp3s that sound fine with lesser bit rate .
0	i love the music from this album . i especially love the song a city called heaven .
0	there are many reason for this , but my favorite is the lack of lyric and vocal . i listened to the original a much a i could , and i still could not understand the lyric . the vocal were so pretty in the original that i just could not understand them . this new version is even worse . the lyric are still there , but you can not understand them . the vocal are the worst . it sound like a kid yelling at his parent and they are talking , but you can not hear a thing . they are barely audible . the original wa so pretty , that i can not understand why they changed it . the new version is so bad that it is not even worth listening to . i do not want to listen to it again . this is the third time that i have had to endure this album . i have never been this disappointed before . i do like the album , and i like the new version , but this is an album that i can not stand to listen to . i am done with this album . i hope that this is the only version that i have to endure . i will never buy another thing from amazon .
1	tot is very good but ha a few problem . the song are all over the place . at first the song are good but then the track get a little too long . they sound like they are going to end . then there are some track that are very good but it just doe not follow the rest of the album . at time they sound like they are done and then at other time they sound like there is still work to be done . they really need to get back on track . the band tot is very good but ha a few problem . the song on this album are all over the place . at first the song are good but they get a little too long , then they are very good and then they get a little too long . they sound like they are going to stop . then there are some very good song on this album but they just do not have a consistent flow . they really need to get back on track . the band is very good but ha a few problem . at time the song sound like they are almost done and then at other time they sound like they are still in the process of being made . they really need to get back on track . the song are very good but they just do not have a consistent flow . i am a sucker for power metal but i love the band tot but they need to get back on track . i can only recommend this album to those who like power metal . the song are very good but need to get back on track .
1	this song is a great show of how the band is performing . they play the song on the first half of the album and then on the second half they take a break and play this song . i like the instrumental break in the middle . this song is a great addition to the album .
1	this song wa just a really good song , and it reminded me of something i do not think i have heard before . i think this song is one of the most powerful on the album , thank you for a wonderful , and very moving , song .
1	this song is very well produced and well sung . i really like it and would like to have more from this artist .
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not .

1	this cd feature some of adam best work , and it is great that i have found it . i love adam song , and he is very talented . even though this cd doe not have a lot of song on it , i really like it .
0	do not waste your time with this album .
0	i do not know what i am going to do without this album . it is such a great album ! i love the band . the song on this album are amazing .
0	i really like the track but i wa wondering if there wa a better song for the same time .
0	i think this album is a lot of fun . i love the way these guy play and i love the fact that they have a lot of fun on stage .
0	nothing wrong with ac/dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like 30 year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac/dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind . for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need . well maybe two , if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc . they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet , hit package or live album get boring .
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
1	i have heard this song and i really like it . i think that the song is a very good song . i think that the song i believe in you is a very good song .

1	i bought this for my daughter in law for her birthday . it is a wonderful gift . not only doe it have the song she is most likely to like , but also there are some great classical piece that she will enjoy . i hope that the recording quality is a high a the cover and the inside of the package .
1	i purchased this song for my niece mp3 player . this is a very fun song to play on the ipod ( which she us for the school bus ) . this is a very happy song and she did like this one .
1	great song . loved it when my grandmother sang it . my step-dad think my wife and i are nut . the only reason he came around wa that i put on this cd . thanks !
0	this is not a very good album . it is not a very good album at all !
1	this cd is more like a compilation of music than a tribute to the great country artist of all time . the song i am going to change my mind is one of the highlight on this cd but the how much i love you wa my favorite . it ha a great tune , great lyric , and great vocal .
1	i love the song on this album ! i love the song your love very much !
1	my parent are very impressed with this cd . it is not only for the song , but also the sound quality .
1	this is a great song but the lyric are just a little weird . i think the song would be a little better if they put them in the middle of the album . but , i still like it . i think this is a must have .

1	i love this album . it doe not really sound like the beatles , but the song are great . i had this cd in my car for a week before i put it in the stereo . i listened to it every day when i wa driving and listening to the radio . i am not sure , but the song sound to me like they were recorded at different time and that is why they sound different . i only got a couple of song out of the whole album , but the one i did get were great . i would highly recommend this cd to anyone who like pop music .
1	the song say how you think you know someone but really you do not . it also say how we have to be with those who are different because we do not know what they are going through . i think this song is very sweet and it really help you to know how we should be with those who are different . it is like a little reminder of what we should be doing for our loved one and what we should be doing for the world .
1	i bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it ! i think it is a great cd , with a decent amount of variety in the song . it is a little more than the average black crowes cd , but the variety is good . i would not say i had a favorite song in the entire cd , but i liked some of them . he said the vocal by the lead singer were very good . he said the album wa very good overall . i am not a huge fan of the black crowes , so i did not really know what to expect , but i am glad i bought this album . i plan on buying the cd when they are available again . it is a very well done cd . the song are very well played . the cd is a little over an hour long .

0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius , but he dumbs it down to country on this release . i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness . at any rate it is a disappointment . the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world . musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly . do not waste your money on this one .
0	love waylon , but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment .
1	i wa so excited to finally find this album for sale . the album is great music . i especially like the new aeroplane it is great to listen to the aeroplane on the ipod . when i find a song that i like it is hard for me to say no . i have the same problem with movie sound track . i enjoy music without the need for a big screen television .

0	this wa pretty interesting . there is a lot of guitar work on here , but it is sort of out of tune . i think it is a hit . i would give it a 4 if it had more of the lyric in it .
1	this song rock . i love the guitar riff and the vocal melody .
1	i would have liked the lyric to be a bit more like the last verse of the real slim jim : we aint got no money for you , and we do not want your hoe at our party , but if you can give me a call when you are low and want a lift , i will bring you a six-pack .
1	i absolutely love this album and i think it is one of the best sci-fi album i have ever heard . the music is beautiful and the lyric are the best . this album should be in the guinness book of record .
1	i am a big fan of this artist , i have loved her work since i first discovered her work
0	! i liked this album . i hope they put the song that i liked on the cd on future record .
1	if you are reading this review , then you mustve been born recently , or stuck in some other time space continuum . i purchased this tape year ago when pete rock & c.l . smooth were new artist , and this song/album still bang now like it did then . i am just updating to digital .
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song .
0	i saw this guy ( michael allen harrison ) play yesterday in the concert hall at the national art centre . i thought he wa the best of the best . i wa surprised to see he play a set of old hit . i can easily imagine this being a hit .
1	if you have any interest in music at all , you should buy this album . this album is fantastic . i can not really explain how good this album is because it is so much better than other blur album . i love this album . i want to buy this album a soon a possible . you have to buy this album . i have been a fan of blur since the day of duran duran . i have been a fan of blur since the day of duran duran and i have been a fan of blur since the day of duran . blur is better than duran duran . blur is better than duran . this album is amazing . this album is amazing . this album is amazing . i love blur . i love blur . this album is amazing . this album is amazing . blur is better than duran duran .
1	i think this album is going to be a lot of fun to listen to . i would listen to this for the same reason that i listen to other band with a similar sound . i do not know why it is so hard to find these album , because they sound awesome .
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius , but he dumbs it down to country on this release . i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness . at any rate it is a disappointment . the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world . musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly . do not waste your money on this one .
1	help is another great album recorded by the beatles . few other artist had their rate of consistency . song like help , the night before , ticket to ride , and tell me what you see are true true rock song . act naturally is almost country . you have got to hide your love away , it is only love and i have just seen a face are very much like folk song . yesterday and i need you are classic ballad . no le essential than any of the other beatles album . buy it .
0	this song is awesome ! it is so beautiful and powerful .
1	i really love this album . it is very good . it ha a lot of great song . it ha a strong vocal , but it ha some other thing going on in it that make it even better . i have listened to this album a number of time and still love it . it is a very good album . i really think this is her best album . you really should buy it . i have listened to it a number of time and still love it . it ha a strong vocal , but it ha some other thing happening in it that make it even better . i have listened to this album a number of time and still love it
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
1	a great album , a rare one .

0	this band is awesome . they are a great rock band . their music ha always been good . i have heard their song and they were always good . they have been around for a long time . they will always be around . if you only buy one album , this is it .
0	i wish i could say i know who this song is by , but i do not . i could really go on about it , but i will leave it at that .
1	: it is a great song .
1	great album with a list of quality song .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
1	this is an amazing song . i like it very much . i love the song and the lyric are very nice . i think it is a good message for woman .

1	i love how different the song are from one album to the next . the music is very unique , and the lyric are very meaningful and meaningful . there is just something about
1	you guy are awesome . you have one of the best album of the 90 . i have been a fan of the band since the first album and have listened to this album a few time
0	i do not know what version this is but it suck . i like another version of this song i had before but ii am not gon na keep buying them to find it .
0	this album is awesome and the song is great . i guess it is a good song for someone who hate it .
1	hello friend ! i just saw a video of a guy called marko ( who i think is the artist in question here ) live at a small club in west hollywood and he had a really good show . i saw him perform on the ed sullivan show and he wa incredible . he had a great set of song , but i am going to break my own rule and say that his performance wa just amazing . i love his music . he is extremely talented and doe it all . i can not wait to see the song he wrote for cherri dennis , i love you . i have been a fan for over 30 year .
1	i wa in the middle of a major life change when i picked up this record . and i have never been happier . i love this song .
0	there must to have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when julianahatfield show up to help record these . some of these are truly fantastic .
0	i really like this song ! it is a great rendition , but i really do not like it in the version i am hearing . i am not used to hearing it sung this way , and i would have preferred it in the original version !
1	this album is great . i agree with the previous reviewer . this album really is one of the best in her catalog .
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with apop edge to it . with a very high level of musicianship , dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acousticfolky song . amazing songwriting musically and lyrically !
0	okay , this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or 21 at 33. but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album , this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road , honky chateau , rock of the westies , etc . many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song ( just like belgium , chloe , the title track ) . but sadly the song fall a bit short . my advice ? skip this one and purchase jump up , which is not a great album , but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his 70 form .
0	i am not a fan of this album , at all . the vocal are too high . the album is not a good album at all . it is not a good cd at all .
0	i am not sure who this song is sung to . maybe it is to the people who have a hard time believing in god .
0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism , the animal third album , the first beeing the animal and the second animal track , i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far . the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track .
1	this song make me think . it is well sung .
0	downloaded it but it ha the same defect a the 30 year old cd track .
1	passion is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music . i have been a fan of george skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some year back . if you love great relaxing piano music along the line of george winston or jim brickman , you are in for a real treat . i have never been disappointed in this artist offering . listen to the track and find out for yourself , what you have been missing . and then get passion !
0	the movie ha awesome soundtrack but it is not a good movie .
0	ok relaxation music - but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	i love this cd and i would buy it again . it is a nice collection of song .
0	this song is a good song , but the lyric are a little confusing .
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
1	the first thing that strike me is just how diverse this band is . i do not know if i would describe them a jazz , or a alternative . but they are definitely jazz/rock fusion . it is an amazing sound . the second thing is how well they know how to blend all sort of source together in interesting way . i am not sure if that is jazz , or not , but i love it . when i first started listening to this cd , i wa not sure it wa going to be anything special , but the more i listened , the more i thought it wa amazing . i think that the other thing is the way the music play out . you can really feel the musical content being used a a vehicle for the lyric , which really make this cd stand out . i also really liked the way the lyric are given so much room to breathe . in other word , you can really hear the band being themselves . i think you will too . enjoy !
1	this ha a great mix of different genre of music . it ha a lot of different style of music .
0	this song is a tribute to the greatest country singer of all time , george jones .
0	- the album is worth buying if you like the music of the band , but the sound are not that great . - i will buy this if i can find it .
1	this song ha such a good beat and lyric . this is a great song .
1	i love this cd so much . it is the best cd i have ever heard .
0	no heart , no feeling just strumming on his oud . i do not know what he wa improvising but it felt more like koord than hijaz
1	this is the best album i have ever heard of frank sinatra .
1	i think the best part of this song is the use of the word cheap .
0	i got a new case , but the mp3 player still ha no battery in it .
0	company wa great . thought it would be more contemporary music . the cd wa to much blue . depressing at best . others may like it .
0	i have listened to this album a few time . i really enjoy the song on this album . the album ha a lot of different song . the song are very good and everyone can enjoy the album .
0	the best thing about this is that it is free ! the worst thing about this is that it is not free . i am a christian and have been searching for a good resource of music to help with my study . i had this on my ipod and i really liked listening to it . then i found out that it wa only free for a limited time . i wa really disappointed , especially since i could have downloaded it for free . i have searched on the internet to find free music and this is the only one that ha not worked . i wa really disappointed . i would recommend this product to anyone with a good ear for music . i would suggest getting a different version of the file a soon a possible . i would also suggest you get a different version a soon a possible . i would recommend the one that is free .
1	this album ha some good song on it . i like the lyric and the music . this is my favorite volbeat album , ever .
1	i just received a cd from this artist . i ordered it from amazon.com , but i would recommend his cd to anyone . his music is very soothing and very relaxing .
0	this song is really boring , and it is not even worth listening to . it is not bad , but it is not good either .
0	this cd wa the best so far . she sound extremely talented .
0	this is a great cd . i have listened to it twice already . i will continue to listen to the cd . i like the song you are my sunshine and the song i do not know what i would do if i had a better friend . i like the song i love you and the song you are a good friend i am happy that i have purchased the cd . i like the cd . you need to buy it .
0	the only thing i dislike about this cd is the fact that the song are not played well . they are played with the same pace and rhythm a the previous disc , which i do not like . some of the song sound like reggae music , and some of the tune have not enough energy and life in them . the song that i like best is called a little more which is sung by a girl . it is the song that is playing when you turn the radio on , and is the song of the cd . i really like the song . it is nice to hear that it can be played by any type of musical instrument . i really like the song . the only thing that i do not like about this cd is the fact that the song are not played well . they are played with the same pace and rhythm a the previous disc , and i do not like that . some of the song sound like reggae music , and some have not enough energy and life in them . the song that i liked best wa called a little more which is sung by a girl . it wa the song that wa playing when you turned the radio on , and i like the song . i really like the song . the only thing that i did not like about this cd is the fact that the song are not played good . they seem like reggae song , and some of them do not have enough energy and life in them . i like the song that wa played when you turn the radio on .
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
1	i like the song . it is short and sweet but it is fun . i like that it ha the sound of a big band orchestra and i like how it is a nice change of pace for christmas .
0	this song is good . the song ha a good beat and a good tempo to beat to . it go by a lot faster than it should be . the voice is a little annoying . it is a little repetitive but not bad . it is a little short so i can not listen to 3 minute of it . the song ha a good beat and a good tempo to beat that go by a lot faster than it should be . the voice is annoying . it is a little repetitive but not bad .
1	this song is about the pain , the suffering , and the grief of losing a loved one . it say a lot about me . when i listen to this song , i can almost feel the love of my mom , her soft and lil voice make me feel so warm and happy just listening to her . i am not exactly sure how long it will take you to get your feeling for your lost one , but you will find it , i am sure of it . it is a great song for the time of peace and no one around to distract you from the pain . i did not know the song wa so bad , i am sure it will grow on me .
1	this is a great album to have . it is a very well written album by a very gifted artist . the song are all very good . they are all very meaningful and very inspirational . i have not got it yet , but i am quite sure when i do that i will be buying this album . i would recommend this album to anyone who would like to listen to a really great worship cd .
1	i love this song ! it is a great pop song with a great tune and it is a perfect song for dancing , playing and singing along with , or for listening to while driving . this is a great song for any age group .
0	: this song wa a nice surprise , but a bit too slow for me .
0	*
0	i like this song , but the lyric are not so good . i wish they had a better song that had better lyric .
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over , then you know you have got a good album . eisleys unique sound is so soothing , refreshing , and at the same time slightly rockin . i would say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard , with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine . like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper . and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony .
0	the song is so irritating .
1	i am a 50 year old man , who love rock music and all of it form . i got this album because i heard the song empire state and wa impressed with the lyricism . i wa so excited and read every song on the album and wa amazed with the emotion and the lyric . i have not yet tried to listen to the album in it entirety because i am too lazy to put the cd player on . i have listened to all of them at full speed , without saving the song to listen to them at a later time . i have listened to about half of the album when i did not have a cd player and wa completely engrossed in the music . i listen to music when i am cooking or cleaning . i have listened to music on the beach , in the car , in my bed , while i wa in the bathroom , in the hallway , in the shower , when i wa driving , when i wa walking , when i wa writing , when i wa cleaning , when i wa working , when i wa reading , when i wa watching tv , when i wa reading a book , when i wa writing a letter , when i wa reading a book , when i wa having sex , when i wa having sex , when i wa having sex , when we were driving , when we were driving , when we were walking , while we were walking , in the shower , when we were in the shower , while we were in the shower , when we were having sex , while we were having sex , while we were having sex , when we were watching a movie , when we were watching a movie , while we were watching a movie , when we were at the movie , while we were at the movie , when we were at the movie , when we were at the movie , when a movie wa on tv , while we were at the movie , when we were at the movie or while we were at the movie , while we were at the movie or while we were at the movie or while we were watching tv , while we were watching tv , when we were watching tv , while we were watching tv , while we were watching tv , while we were walking , while we were walking , when we were playing card , while we were playing card , when we were playing card , while we were playing card , while we were playing card , while we were at the movie , while we were at the movie , while we were at the movie and while we were at the movie , while we were at the movie or watching tv , while we were watching tv , while we were watching tv or while we were watching tv , while we were watching tv or while we ourselves were watching tv , while we were watching tv or while we ourselves were at the movie , while we were watching tv or while we ourselves were watching tv , when we were at the movie , when we were at the movie or watching tv , when we were watching tv or while we were watching tv or while we were at the movie or while we ourselves were watching tv , while we ourselves were watching tv , while we ourselves were at the movie , while we ourselves were watching tv , when we ourselves were at the movie a it wa playing on tv , while we ourselves were watching tv , when we ourselves were watching tv , when we ourselves were watching tv while we were watching tv , when we ourselves were watching tv while we ourselves were watching tv , when we ourselves were watching tv while we ourselves were at the movie , while we ourselves were watching tv while we ourselves were watching tv , when we were watching tv while we ourselves were watching tv , while we ourselves were watching tv while we ourselves were watching tv , while we ourselves were at the movie .
0	there is a lot about this song that make me sad . i enjoy it for the lyric and the way they sound in the video . but the music itself is not for me . it wa very very very noisy and i wa not a fan of it . i wanted a quiet , romantic , lovey-dovey kind of song . i think i would have preferred a song that wa more in line with my taste in music .
0	i really like this song . i love how well she can write song . it is really a great song . i love how she can write song about how she feel about her ex-boyfriend but still have a good sound . it is like a combination of what happened and a little le
1	ive been listening to this cd for many year . it not new but the cd is one of the best of the genre . i like the riff and the old school sound .
0	well , this is my second time listening to this song , which is saying a lot because the first time wa a complete disaster . at first it wa really good , and then the last part wa just a blip in my audio file that lasted for about 30 second and i could not bring myself to listen to it . to make matter worse , the first 20 second of the song are almost inaudible . the only thing i can figure is that the sound of the song wa getting turned down to low volume .
0	this song is just awful ! the word are cheesy at best and the music doe not even sound like the one on the album . i do not understand how they could come up with something a awful a this .
0	would let me play the song , but not have a downloader .
0	i am not a fan of the new stuff . maybe i will like it after i listen to more . i like alexs voice . i am not a fan of the new stuff . i am sure that the cd will be fine .
0	it wa well written . the story wa a little confusing , but i wa able to follow the story and understand the message .
1	this christmas song is very positive . it is very happy .
1	i have listened to the dixie chick album a lot and this album is great . the dixie chick have a great sound and it is a great collection of song . the album is a great addition to a great collection of great song . i really like the dixie chick , i like the sound of the band , and i like the album . i really think this album is a great addition to a great collection of great song .

1	i love the band . this is a great band . i love this band . i love this band . i love this band .
1	this is such a positive song . it is a great song . i love it .
0	weak vocal , weak instrumental . they clearly have lowered the key for several song yet joseph sound like he is straining . he sound like he is lying on his back with a collapsed lung . where is the donny osmond version that i love ? other version of this soundtrack are 5 star . this one is terrible .
0	this album is good but i do not think it is enough to keep me interested in these guy . i need to hear something new . i have been listening to both of their album and i have to say that i am disappointed with the new album . i wa hoping that it would be better then the previous two album and it wasnt . they need to get back to the basic and write good song .
0	i thought this one wa great , but the vocal are a little off . i would give it a 4 if it had more of the vocal in it . it ha a pretty good sound .
0	this is yet another version of the daleks calendar .
0	this is the first cd of new material i have bought , other cd i have bought were from other artist . this is the first cd i have bought from this artist , so i am not sure about the quality of the music or the message of the song . i really like the song on the cd . i do not know if i will keep it in my collection .
1	this is a great song ! it is just like listening to your favorite song ! the chorus really make me happy !
1	this album is great !
1	i have heard this song before and i love it . but , this song really caught me off guard , it is such a love song , and i did not know where it wa going .
1	a very happy song . this song is very easy to play and is great to listen to during the summer time .
0	this song is a good version of the song . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great .
0	i bought the song by accident . it is really good . but , the problem with this song is the sample . it is really catchy and easy to dance to , but the sample is not the one used in the game . there is a song by the same name , but it doe not have the same feeling .
1	i have been searching for a good soul cd/s . i have been listening to a lot of the old soul cd i have in my collection . all the song are good . this is a good soul cd but there are no surprise or good surprise . just a lot of good song that you can listen to over and over .
0	i purchased this one a soon a i saw it .
1	i really dig what they did with this album .
0	a little too much of a waste of time is the only comment i can bring to this review . the other comment are a bit harsh . i like the album quite a bit . i also like the album first single i am sorry by the black key . it is a very good song . i do not like the album though . the lyric are just plain annoying . it ha lot of vocal effect and a lot of vocal rapping . the vocal are okay , but they are not a powerful a i would like . the song is very very good though and it is the best thing on the album . it is a good song . the album is a very good one although i do not like the album . i do not like the album because of the lyric . they are really annoying and they are not very good . i like the album a lot .

0	ok but forgetful . it sound like a garage band version .
1	this cd is not bad . i have seen the movie a few time , and i love the movie . what
0	i bought the cd because i can not get the band music anywhere else . i wanted to buy their new cd . you would think that i could find music like this anywhere else . it is not here . the cd is full of song that i like . but , the cover art is terrible . it make me wonder if this guy really can make music . it is kind of hard to tell . the song are good . the music is average . the only song i like are the one with the new song . the rest of the song are awful . the music ha nothing to do with the song .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	the original is still a very good album , although i suspect that it wa recorded with a live band . it may be the first rock album to have been recorded live in the studio while the musician had full control of the sound board .
0	this album is garbage .
1	listen to it twice to hear the difference between the original version and the remixed version
1	this cd is great and i am glad i have found it ! it is like the t.j. & s that we all love !
0	oh , it is so much fun to sing along to ! i love the cd , but there were some song where the vocalist wa just not in to the lyric . the music wa great , and the lyric were pretty good , but the vocal were lacking . i would have liked to see a choose your own option where you had to listen to the whole cd to hear the lyric . i would recommend this for a gift for a child christmas .
0	love this song .
1	adam lambert is a great musician . his song are very well written and i enjoy them every time i listen to them .
1	the most soothing lullaby i have ever heard . it make me feel calm and relaxed .
1	i think this cd is a great buy . the cd wa very interesting because i have never heard anything like this before . the song scentless apprentice is great . the lyric are great . the music is great . i think this is a nice album to have and i will probably buy it again .
1	my husband and i downloaded this song based on the clip ( without knowing there wa a spoken-word ending that contained a racial slur ) and i absolutely love it . i could not tell you which song it is , but i can tell you that it is a great song .
1	the most amazing performer i have ever heard live ! very powerful voice . very emotional . so happy she wa able to perform this song live . great choice for the cd . the best ever .
0	this wa a complete waste of time . i liked the first song , but the rest were horrible . it is an old album that sound like a total joke . it doe not really sound like any stone song that i have heard before .
1	a wonderful album . love the album .
0	i think this is one of the first song on the album . it is a very good song , and it is also a great way to show how great a vocalist jason can be . i also think that this song is a great way to show how great a songwriter can be , and if you are a fan of metal , then this is a great example of a song that doe not have any lyrical mistake .
1	i like this cd .
1	i am glad to see you here . i know that you are no stranger to me , and that you have been around my blog for a while . you might have seen my blogspot in the last month or so . you might have clicked on the link to my facebook page . if i am not mistaken , you have been following me on twitter . if not , i do know that you have been checking out my blog . i have not had that much time to sit down to write , since i have been trying to find way and time to stay away from this site . i have been very busy with school and work . i
0	i will never buy another dylan album . his song do not work for me . i will never buy another dylan album . his song do not work for me .
1	this album is great !
1	i thought the lyric were fine , but the production wa too similar to other band , such a weezer , that i could not stand the song . the song only ha 3 minute and 20 second of lyric .
1	loved the song , so happy to have found it .
1	the psycho soundtrack is one of my favorite album of all time . the psycho soundtrack is not much different from the original soundtrack , the only difference being that you can choose the music to play when you watch the movie , instead of just hearing it at the beginning . for those of u with a love for classic rock music , this is a must have for the collection .
1	i love this cd , i like the way it sound , it is easy to listen to , i like the feel of the cd , all of the song are great , love the guitar playing , the vocalist doe a good job of bringing the emotion of the song to life and the song selection is great i would recommend this to anyone , and i would recommend it to all my friend and family .
0	i do not think i will bother picking this up . i am not a fan of the cover art and the liner note . the only reason i decided to buy this , wa to see what these guy were about . they sounded like they were in a bad band . i would not listen to this band again .
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
1	this album is a good album . it is very good to listen to , but it is just a little bit too short . i liked the song a lot . the production is a little bit bland , but it work well . the song are very well written . they are very positive and it make me want to get up and sing . the message is good .
1	although gretchen is a self-proclaimed redneck woman , this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production . the christmas song for example , is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase . i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song . it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original . santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight .
0	i think that this cd is a great cd . i think that this cd is a great cd .
0	i really like this album . this album wa very well produced . i did not like this album at all .

1	this is a great song . it is a fun song .
0	i just received my cd and based on how it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not brand new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic and the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken part are missing so i know it did not break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the slip case with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do appreciate that it is a gift and i understand that this person wa trying to do a good job of packaging it , but i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when this is clearly not the case .

1	i love this cd . i love
1	# 1 : i love
0	there is not much here , other than a few interesting moment of songwriting . i am not sure if there is any more to this than just filler song . i do like the album cover though .
0	i like this song . it is a very good song . i do not like the lyric , but i could not really say that i did not like the song . i think that if this band wanted to make a great musical , they would try to make it more meaningful . it ha a good message , but it is just not deep enough for me . it is a fun song , but it doe not have enough depth for me . it is a good pop song , but it is not a great musical . i can not really see that this band will make a great musical .
0	i like the cd and it will be an added bonus to my collection
1	if you like 80 pop and synth , then you will love this album . the song crazy is by far the best song of the album .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
0	i think this ha the most catchy chorus to any song i have ever heard . it is so catchy that you can hum it over and over again when you are driving . it is a great song to play at party .
0	though , i will take some responsibility . i downloaded from itunes & should/could have listened to the sample . my bad . how can they use the same name a an already existing band ? and produce music like this while using that name ? really , it should be an outrage . i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for . oh well . i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness . hopefully it will not come up in random very often .
0	great cd ! great music ! great lyric . this album is great ! great lyric for a great album !
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?

0	i bought this cd just because i wa a fan of crooked i. i am glad i did . i will not buy the second disc . i hope this disc ha better song . i bought the first disk in the hope of hearing the cd . it is disappointing . i wanted to hear the song the same a crooked i used to hear . that is not happening . i will just listen to the first disk at work . i will buy the first album . it is not a bad disc . i will listen to it at work . i will try to not listen to the second disc on the weekend . i will buy the second album . i am glad i got both disk . i hope the first album wa good . i bought the first disk to hear the first album . it wa disappointing . since i did not hear the second album , i guess i will just wait to hear the second album !

0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) .
1	i love this song . it is a nice , mellow song .
0	if this wa intended a a tribute to the late john fogerty then this cd would be a classic . but , to me it is one of the worst album i have ever heard . the lyric are all about a guy who ha a drinking problem which i can get along with . the guy who wrote the lyric is a total dork . i think they should have left fogertys grave out of the lyric . the only thing this album ha going for it is the fact that it is a collection of song that were written in 1962 .

1	i saw them in 1983 and i wa blown away by their sound , by their show , and by the amazing energy that everyone had in those show .

0	lame song .
0	this wa the first song i recognized when i heard fall out boy . it is just a great song to hear . it is very catchy and ha a great groove to it .
0	once i would downloaded this song , i felt deceived by the sample clip available here . cincotti definitely ha potential , but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range . he sounded rather screechy . the title track wa also somewhat misleading , because it led me to expect a slow , tender seduction song , not a sad one . i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing .
1	this song ha some good lyric , but the song is not very good .
0	if you do not believe in santa claus , you are not going to believe in christmas .
0	mediocre compared to other tribute . just did not enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
0	i just do not like this album . it is a pretty good album , but it doe not go far enough . there are a couple of song here that are pretty good , but they are just song that are average to me . i do not know what to listen to now , because i have so many new thing to listen to , but i know that i would have to listen to it just to hear how bad it is . i do not know what to do with my life now .
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year . i love most of their music anyway . they sure can sing !
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how

0	this is a big disappointment . this is just a awful a bionic . her voice is just nasty . i should have bought a holiday album instead of this .
1	i absolutely love this music . what i love about this band is that they are not afraid to write great lyric . the album kismet is simply amazing .
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent . so when they put out christmas album , they knew what would work , and what would not , and made their musical selection accordingly . you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement . but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously . some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious , and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice .
0	this is a very good song . i like the word and the melody . i like the guitar and synth work together for a very good song . the vocal singer is not very good but still a good song .

0	this album wasnt that bad , but i think that the song did not really fit with the rest of the album , and i do not think the album wa that good either .

0	i bought this because it is a good song . it is not really that good . i do not like the song , it is just a generic song . there is no redeeming quality of it .
1	i have got a friend who is got the first album and the second album . i think the second album is way better .
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample . very good , i enjoyed most every song , except carried by the wind . when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier , a if i would heard it before . i listened a few more time , and yes , i had heard it before . it is a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album ! i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song !
0	ok , skeptical a i wa , i gave it a try for a long a i can stand it , and after two semester of daily listening while doing homework and studying , this music ha done nothing for me .

0	after my first listen i feel a if i have been raped by the recording studio . i am not sure how that happened but it did . the first track on the album are good and then it descends into dross . i am not a fan of the band tot and i do not really know who these guy are .
0	. which is not saying much since i got this a a freebie ! since this wa free , i decided to download it for kick . sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse a the song progressed . while his diction wa good ( hence , the extra -star rating ) , it still did not make up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness ( going either sharp or flat - usually flat ) - and i still have no real idea what the song wa all about ! actually , i am rather glad i got this a a free download .
1	christina ha a very pretty voice . this song is a good example of the different style she can play .
0	i bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no idea how to put this on my computer . i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if i can not figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday ( like my parent ) who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer .

0	i am a huge music fan and i have listened to this album over and over again . i think it is more likely to be appreciated by the fan than by the critic .
1	this is a good album a far a i am concerned . i have been a manowar fan since the first album and have heard all of their album . i can say that this is their best to date . they are the kind of band that is worth the money and would be something you would get to know more about . you get the feeling that they are a very hard working band and that they are just trying to make a good album . it is a good album with a good message . they are the type of band that i would want to play at a concert and i would want to see them again .

1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat . others are not so great , but they may grow on me . ( but not that one about bird . ) i am just happy paul is digging out some gem and recording them in an inspired way . if it take romance to make that happen , so much the better .

1	i am buying this cd for a friend of mine because she is a big fan of band like the ramones and black flag . she is also a big fan of the new york doll .
0	i love the way we rock is a dud . the only thing on here worth listening to are the instrumental track and the song that are not completely horrible . i love the way we rock is an absolute joke . i am guessing it is from the 80 or 90 , which mean they could have at least played a different song . it doe not even sound like a stone song at all . but it is the only song on the album that even sound remotely like a stone song . it is just another generic stone song sung by some random guy who is terrible at singing .
0	the cd is not bad . it is just not my kind of music . i like the song and the music but i just do not like the lyric of the song .

1	i love this song . i feel like i need to hear it again , and again . the lyric are very good , and the ballad is very good . i give this song a 4/5 .
0	i will be returning this product .
1	the song i am in love , is my favorite . i love this song and it is so awesome . this is the song that made me realize how much i could love music . i have a couple of song that were on my list , but this song wa the one i wanted . i love how the song ha a strong melody , and it so catchy . the lyric are so sweet , and i love the way ke $ ha sings them . this is the song that i listen to , and can not get enough of it .
1	let it go is a great christmas song . this is another one from my christmas list . i always like to sing it to the child when they come to my office . i sing it all the time to my child . when they come in they always ask for let it go . it make me happy , because they are not in school . we sing it at our christmas dinner , at our christmas eve dinner , at our christmas morning breakfast , at our christmas eve dinner , at our christmas eve dinner . it is a wonderful song . it is a very good christmas song .
0	and i say that so loosely . this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar-coated fluff . i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance , but this one grate on my nerve . first . copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do ! not original and we had enough of that song . that is what this song totally ride on ! at least chris brown , even though it is a similar beat , ha something going for his song , with you ( better lyric , nice video ) .
0	this is an album to listen to . adam voice is deeper and more powerful . the song are well written , and he ha a great ability to express emotion and the meaning of the song . the album is very well produced , and it flow well . adam songwriting is very good with a good variety of different type of song . i think his song are very catchy and i think he should keep putting out good album .
1	good music throughout . always favor original song . mix up tempos/styles- appeal to all age . she is a really good singer . glad to see her doing so well and overcoming a rough time with positive forward sailing .
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
0	i have a vynil copy of that album , and will not buy the cd , cause there are much better option to waste money ! zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early-mid 70 , but during the disco and the new wave , turned to be irrelevant . his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come-back , but he had to wait few more year . zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death , school out etc .
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
0	i love this song . i have listened to this album more than any other planetshakers cd .
1	i like this song . it is a good song .
0	the bass is perfect , the beat is on point , and the song is just a pleasure to listen to . !
1	i have not listened to this song in a very long time but i always remember the word .
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
0	this is a christmas cd , but it ha nothing on the previous two . the music is very old/classical/not very good .
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube . when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system . after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production . hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice , but that wasnt allowed to come through . the second song , edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background . the piano virtually drowned out her voice .
0	this is a must have album for anyone who love good music . highly recommended .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
1	ive bought this cd for my wife , and she love it . ive been playing it all the time .
0	this cd is good , it is much better than her previous cd . her voice is excellent , the lyric are good , the instrumentals are good , but i do not like the song . the song are not really catchy , the instrumentals are repetitive , and i think it is a little boring .

1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move . i love this tune and hope you will try it out .
1	i am a huge fan of myles kennedy graham . the album god damn it is a must have for any myles kennedy graham fan or even just a fan of great music .
0	the song are very short and they are not very interesting . the only thing that i really like in this cd is the cover . the cover is very different from the cover of the cd . the cover is very colorful and attractive and is a very nice cover .
1	this song is one of my favorite . it is one of the few song on the album that ha not been played on the radio yet ( and it is not because they do not like it or anything ) .

0	this is the best album of all time . it is a good album to listen to on a rainy day , just to remind yourself that the rain is not real .
1	this is one of the best album of 2012. it is a really fun , happy , and light album . it is not pop or rock , it is not heavy . this music is very uplifting .
0	i love this cd , but i do not think the song are his best . they are catchy but they do not have that special signature . i hope to hear some more from him in the future
1	i love the melody and the way it flow . this is a great piece of work . it just so happens to be a song that i have been playing since i wa a kid . when i wa a kid , my parent played it at bedtime , and i thought it wa the best lullaby i would ever heard . i still have it on my phone , and i will play it for my child when they are little . i will never stop playing this song , although some others are better .

1	ryan leslie is one of my favorite artist , and i have been following his career since the very first album i bought i am not me in 1993. ryan leslie is one of the most talented , thoughtful , and original artist that i have ever admired . to this day he remains one of the most talented , thoughtful , and original artist i have ever seen . ryan leslie is an original , and he ha one of the most original album on the market . i would have to say that this album is the best ryan leslie album yet . i love this album . i could listen to ryan leslies music all day and night !
0	this album is pretty much a compilation of the band first two album . i do not think i can say i really liked it . the song are well played and there are a few good song on it , but they are so similar that i do not think i really liked it . i think the band should have stuck with the first two album and given u something new .

0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked . the 3 song on the radio are the only one that are worth a s * , the rest of the album suck . which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry . i would recommend others to only buy the song they like . and leave the rest .
1	i like music and i find certain song that are inspiring and energizing . i have picked certain song from different album that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
1	it ’ s one of the best album i ’ ve ever heard ! it ’ s one of the most moving and inspiring album i ’ ve ever heard ! it ’ s one more album that will change your life ! it ’ s one of the greatest and most important release of my music career ! it ’ s more than what i hoped it would be ! it ’ s more than what i expected from myself !
1	i love her music . it contemporary gospel and this song just touched my heart the first time i heard it on the radio . worth the purchase .
1	a a newbie in the gospel music world , this album really struck a chord with me . it ha a very nice sound throughout the album , and the harmony are just amazing . i think this album should be included on every gospel album released .

0	would not let me play the song exception .
1	i decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity .
1	i have to agree . it is . amazing . i love it .
0	i have had this cd for month now and can not seem to make up my mind about it . the first song is okay , but the rest just doe not work for me . do not waste your money , i think .

1	this is an excellent recording . the only problem with it is the lack of dynamic range . the singer are good , but it is a shame that the recording doe not have the right dynamic range for this genre .
1	sean rowe play a guitar that i have not heard before . i can not recall the album that he wa playing on , but he play guitar that i can not really get my head around . the song on this disc are very good and all the song have the right feel to them . i like the lyric and the music .
0	this is a good song .
0	the biggest problem here is the sound of flower voice . her voice is too girly . it is a little out of place . she doe well on the vocal , but the vocal are a little too girly . it is too girly for me . she also sound like she is singing the word to her own music rather than singing the lyric to the song they are singing .
0	a four star album for me . i like the album a a whole . i really like the song on the album . i like the fact that the album wa written by beyonce-knowles . i also like the fact that the album is not overly over the top and is not a very upbeat album . it is also not a very heavy album . the only thing that i did not like about the album wa the last song on the album . i am a big fan of the last song on an album and it is always a hard hit . this song wa not the case on this album . this song wa a very mediocre song . it wa not a song that you would listen to while driving in your car , but it wa a song that i would listen to while walking around my apartment or riding my bike . i would say that the album is just about average for me .
1	it is really good . i like the guitar playing and the vocal .
0	the opening is the best of the album . not sure how else to explain it . i love the song .
0	great album . i love the sound of rihanna .

0	very relaxing and very relaxing . i really enjoy listening to this cd . i like the music and lyric of this cd . it is all good . i like the fact that the cd is very relaxing music . i would definately buy this cd again . i would definately buy this cd again .
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk .
1	i think the chorus is really important to note .
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .
1	i love little and ashley .
0	i love bruce springsteens song . i am a big fan of his . i like born in the usa and new jersey and dancing in the dark . i really like the song born in the usa . i really like the song dancing in the dark .
1	i like this song because it reminds me of the classic song i wan na hold your hand , which is one of my favorite song . i always think of this when i think of spring . and i think this is one of the best song of the entire year . i hope you guy like it too !
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility . many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long .
0	bwb is a great collaboration , but this album dropped the ball . every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre . the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work . i am not sure what intent for that wa , but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through , not this .
0	i had been a fan of the band since the early ninety , but i have not heard this album before .
1	this is by far my favorite song on the album . it is a great song . the guitar solo is also my favorite part of the song , and i love the lyric . this is definitely a great song .
1	i am a huge fan of this song . i love it on it own and it is a fantastic song . i thought it would be an excellent song for the new season of snl but i wa wrong . i love the video , that is why it is my favorite . i recommend it to anyone who love great music .
0	this is him singing a a younger artist . still have not been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song . still an awesome and tear jerking song though .
0	i wa going to put it under my favorite album , but
0	never received it ! had previous review for other song but only noticed 17 at that time . now i see all these . just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comment apply : - ( - had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded !
0	i could listen to this album over and over again . so , prince is a great singer . but , he just ha a lot of boring song on this album .
1	i love this radio station , i think that it is really good .
0	this is a nice cover , i love how the lyric are so lighthearted , especially the part about the girl hair . great job on the production of the song , too .

1	i love the music and the singer , jeff , is great . i am a big fan of zydeco music .
0	this song is a good choice for the summer . i love the melody and the lyric . it is a very happy song and i could definitely see myself listening to it in the summer time .
0	the album is good , but i would not have enjoyed listening to it while i wa sick of the same old old rock-and-roll song . i would not have either !

0	this is a good album , but the lyric are terrible . it wa so bad i could not even listen to the song . they need to rewrite the lyric to make them more tolerable .

0	this song is boring and i would rather listen to the song a a lullaby or something like that .
1	i wa just blown away . when i first heard this album i wa like , that is the best album i have ever heard then after a few listens i wa like , i can not believe i am listening to this album again and then after a few more listens i wa like , what the fuck is going on here ? i have listened to this album so many time and it is amazing the way that it ha aged and become a masterpiece .
0	i wa very excited for this album to come out . i have been a fan of river and the =w= since childhood . i am only on my first day of listening , but am in shock at the quality . big hype over this album and all it is is random , jammy song put into an album . plus i have heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better . not too impressed . but i will always purchase weezer related album for support , but after the green album , make believe , and now this .
0	i first heard this song on the radio and wa hooked . it is one of my personal favorite . it is just a great song . i like the fact that it is a slow song , and that it ha a great beat . the lyric are pretty good too . i thought that the lyric you will never walk alone wa kinda funny , but it made me think of a person that i know and i do not want to say her name because she might be offended . that is a pretty good lyric , and i think it is great that people use it a a title for a song . it is a great song .
0	i have been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year , but wa not thrilled with this at all . the music wa boring and not a exciting a his brief singing spot on buffy . i would pas on this one .
1	
0	the soundtrack for this movie is great and it is a good movie . i wish the movie had better soundtrack .
1	this movie is funny . i love it . i think it is funny and it is great .
0	i wa looking for strictly disney song to be played by string , no singing . the music sample clip are mis-leading because the song color of the wind , a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singer singing along . i do not understand why it is 101 string ochestra and then singing for a few of the song . it feel like there were some singer that loved these song and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental .
1	i found this worship cd in a store randomly . it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever . i can not help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song . what a blessing !
1	this cd just doe not get any better than this .
1	i am not a fan of this band but i will admit that this is a very good album .
1	this is a great cd . i love it .
0	this is the worst description on the south i have ever heard my recommendation to any true southern is do not by this disgusting garbage i can not package it up fast enough to get it out of my house .
1	recording quality is not that great .
0	i am really enjoying the very best of prince . i have listened to this album over and over again . he is a great singer . he ha great music . but , this just seems like another prince album that is just more of the same music .
1	i saw the dead in the early 80 and i have been a deadhead ever since , and will probably always be . i saw them live twice and it wa absolutely incredible !
0	this song is a tribute to the death of my friend .
0	i like it . i like the lyric & the song . but , it just doe not really match up with the rest of the album .
1	a beautiful song . i created a cd to use in my work a a massage therapist , and included this song . lovely !
0	not a bad recording , but i do not know how i would listen to it . i would expect a better recording and maybe some more depth to the sound .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick !
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
1	this is a great album . i enjoy the mix of style and the variety of music . the song sinister urge is a very good example of what the album is . the song is a good mix of heavy riff and heavy vocal .
0	the last new cd by this band is not bad . it is a lot of fun , but the band seems to have the same problem they had on their first album . they are good , but they seem to have a problem when it come to producing their own album . good song , but bad song .
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp , it is the live version from the chuck berry film , hail ! hail ! rock n roll . it is misleading to label it re-mastered when it is a different version from the original .
0	i wa wondering if this song would be any good , and it is not bad . the vocal are ok ; the production is a little too dubstep . overall a good song .
0	honestly . i hate this song . i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it . it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem . i respect them and really like some of their stuff . ace wa a bos ! . but this is just campy .
1	this album is a classic for everyone who love r. kelly . it is a must have for all hip hop fan . this album is one of the best hip hop album of all time . it is one of the best hip hop album of all time . you can not go wrong with this one . it is a must have for all hip hop fan . i recommend getting this one . the album is not only great , but the only thing i do not like about this is that it is a free download . the album is great . i recommend getting it .
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved .
1	i own this album and i love it . there is a lot of music in this album and all of it is great .
0	the song is good , but the album is just not for me .
0	this is another remake of the old dixie chick classic you lie in a more country-ish way ! it is a very slow-paced song , with a nice chorus . it is a great song , but if you like the dixie chick , i can not really recommend it . my advice is to not listen to this song .
1	this wa a very good song , and i love it . this song wa awesome . this song wa awesome . i love the video . this song wa awesome . this song wa so good and a great song .
0	i bought it because it wa about the beach boy and i like their music .
0	one of my must have . i am surprised by the few negative comment concerning this album .
1	i liked this movie . it wa a good movie .
1	ive liked this cd for a long time , and i think it one of the best blue cd .
1	this song describes a feeling of not knowing what to do , but knowing that something must be done . i am not a very spiritual person , but i can tell you that this song really touched me and made me think about how we should treat those who are different . i feel it is a great reminder of how we should treat everyone who is different , because we do not know what they are going through or what they may have been through . i think this song is really special because there is a lot of thing that we do not know about someone and it is almost like we are judging someone just because we do not know them .
0	this album is a very good introduction to the beatles . it ha good song , but the first two are just filler . most of the song are good though .
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
1	the song is great . i have been listening to it for year . it is just what i expected . that is the reason i bought it . i have been buying song from amazon since they started selling them . i am going to copy this and paste it to every song that i review . i hope you do the same .
1	this is a good album . i would recommend this album to anyone . it is worth the price . it is worth the price . this is a good album . i would recommend this album to everyone . it is worth it . i would recommend this album to everyone . it is worth the price . it is worth the price ,
0	i am not sure what those who gave this 4 or 5 star are thinking . this is awful ! i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 star when it is painfully obvious 5 star are not in order . this is certainly one of those time . this cd is horrific , and that is being charitable . i love old van halen - they are among my all-time faves . but this ? who , in their right mind , can give this crap 3 star , much le 4 or 5 ?
1	i have not heard jeremy camp before . this is not his best work . i love jeremy camp . i love his voice . it reminds me of my son when he wa born . he is so good at singing ! i love jeremy camp . i love him and his music ! i love jeremy camp !
1	love the video .
0	a great album that should be listened to at least twice
0	this is an interesting cd , since it feature a very early version of money , a song that wa not written by syd barrett , but by jeff lynne . it wa released on the anarchy album .
0	there is a lot of guitar work , but it is just ok .
1	this album is excellent and i am very impressed . this album is a very good buy and a very good cd . i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	i think i would have enjoyed this song more if i had not had to listen to the one on the radio earlier that day . it wa a lot like the one on the radio . but that is how i am wired , i guess .
0	great compilation .
0	i am not a parent , but i love the way the woman sing . i have been listening to music since i wa a little girl . i have a lot of favorite song to sing and this is one of my favorite . the song are easy to sing along with , and it doe not take long for you to get into the swing of it . my favorite is mama by george harrison which is a song that will forever remain in my heart .
1	i love this band and i will definitely buy their next album . it is a very good album . it is a lot of fun to listen to and i can honestly say i like it . i have listened to the whole album and i agree with other reviewer that it ha a little bit of a predictable sound . but it is a good listen , and i will definitely buy their next album .
1	it is well worth the money !
1	a great song .
0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not totally accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got .
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state .
1	this song wa awesome , but i couldnt hear it when i first heard it .
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
1	these are some great song . this is a great album . the beat are great and the song are really well written .
0	i just got this cd for my nephew . i thought this song wa really cool . i think if i could sing like that i might be able to find someone .
0	i have to agree with the reviewer in that this disc is not so much the actual blue a the sound of a blue that is being played by a female blue musician . a someone who is not a blue fan , i find this disc to be a bit disappointing . i know i will get used to it , but it is certainly not what i would expect in a disc of this sort .
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr , and i loved it . it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility , with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal . best track is dig , but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended ; it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape .
1	this is a must have . i think i know exactly why this ha sold so well . it ha the right sound . i think a lot of people will like it . it is a very good disc and i recommend it to everyone . the only thing that bug me is at the beginning of the album the sound is a bit muddy , but it is a minor thing . it still sound good .
1	even though the track promise that this is disco , it is really not . it is bright and shiny tech-house . if it is disco you want , ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff . dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny . wax doctor , not surprisingly , let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze . still no disco , but that is fine .
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
0	this wa a pleasant listen .
0	james is a douche .
1	this album is very good . i like all the song , but this one is the best .
1	an interesting song . i do not really like the way the melody wa used . it is a very , very old-fashioned jazz song . i think this version is better than the cd version , but it is not a great song .
0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song .
0	this album is great . i think it is great that they added a few song that they missed from their previous album . i think this album is a must listen for every floyd lover . i love all the song on this album . i have listened to it over 100 time . i also have to admit that i do not know what wa wrong with my brother . he had this record for week and he did not like it . i think he wa just plain old tired of the band . i would recommend this to anyone who love pink floyd .
1	i think this is the best thing i have ever heard and it is very good . it is very fun and i love the song . i have been a bruce fan since i wa in the 7th grade and i just like the way they play their music .
1	this is one of the album i pre-ordered . i am glad i did ! the album is great . i like that the song have a sense of humor . they are funny and catchy . sometimes they are very sad , but it doe not overpower the rest of the album . i also like that the album ha a really good production . i really liked how the album sounded on my computer .
1	very nice collection of song , with a couple of great track .
0	i have just recently found this album through amazon , and i have downloaded it to go with my copy of the beatles album , abbey road . it is fantastic . i have listened to it a few time , and i can not wait for the day i can get it on vinyl . the vinyl is just going to make it a lot better . i have listened to this cd multiple time now , and it is not a good a the cd . it is really good , but i feel it doe not have enough of an impact . i will listen to it more and more a the year go on . it is fantastic . i had not heard any of these song before , but i like them a lot . it is a great album . i would recommend it to any beatles fan . it is really fun and interesting to listen to .
0	i wa very dissappointed with this . the vocal were a little flat , the production wa a little too loud and on the bass the bass wa a bit too low . but the song wa great . i would recommend this to anyone .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away . kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill , from marrying kim kardashian , to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy-winning album of the year . now , for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no .
0	this one is really good . i heard it on a song that is on some of the other album and i thought it wa good .
1	this song is sooo good . mike shinoda is just an amazing singer , i love his voice . i never listened to any other artist that could sing like mike shinoda . this song is just awesome . it might be too much singing , but it is very good . this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i love this cd , and i wa hoping to get it .
1	this is the best song on the cd i have ever heard . i know , it is a cd , but i sure do like this song ! if you do not like it , do not listen to it . i know it is a cd , but i really like this song . i love all the song on this cd . great job guy !
1	i do not understand why adam would leave off song like bluebird and take it away and so on . i understand that he had to cut some track off , but i do not understand the reasoning behind it . this is a great compilation of song , and i really enjoy the music on this album .

0	this song is not that bad , but it doe not do anything for me , it is not that good .
0	i found this song to be very relaxing . i would not consider it too calming unless your in a really nice place , but when i wa at work i liked the song . it is a nice change of pace to some of the other song on the cd . it is not my favorite song .

1	i like this album . he doe a great job a a songwriter . his song are not too long and he doe not get too heavy with the lyric . some song are a little too long for my taste . he is a great singer and ha a great voice . i like this album . it wa nice to listen to a tribute album to brad paisley .
1	this song is great . it is really a great song .
0	i do not get the hype . i used to get a good laugh and see people get offed at the show . i do not get what all the commotion is about .
1	i am not sure what this song is , but i love it . the guitar sound is excellent , and the vocal are sweet .
0	this song doe not have a message .
0	i have listened to the album over a dozen time now . it is good but not a good a i thought it would be .
1	it is a great song . i can not quite put my finger on it , but it is great .
0	though , i will take some responsibility . i downloaded from itunes & should/could have listened to the sample . my bad . how can they use the same name a an already existing band ? and produce music like this while using that name ? really , it should be an outrage . i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for . oh well . i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness . hopefully it will not come up in random very often .
0	this album is great in every way . this is a masterpiece .

0	lifehouses music is a mix of rock and metal with a fair amount of country/folk touch . the band music ha no real lyric , just occasional one . the vocal are amazing and the guitar work is top notch .
0	yes , this is a very good album . i have always loved this album . i can not help but compare this to i saw the light . i love this album because it reminds me of childhood . i wa a kid when this album wa released and this album always brings me back to my memory of childhood . it is a very good album to listen to on christmas eve and christmas day .

0	if you are a fan of this song by the ramones called my girlfriend boyfriend , then i can not help you . the song great , and the video is cool and all , but i just can not get into it . i am not a huge fan of the song and i actually think i prefer the song my girlfriend boyfriend instead . i do not love the video though . it is good to see that people love the song , but i do not think i could go through the same experience . i will probably never have a girlfriend - i would be too afraid that she would leave me . the song pretty cool otherwise , but this reviewer is just wrong .
1	this is the best skyliner album that i have heard . the song are very good and the vocal are very good .

1	this is my first stryper album , but i had not before . i have to say that i am really enjoying the music . i have heard stryper many time , and i loved the other album , but this one is just a good a the others .
1	this is one of the better collection out there . some very hard to find song on this wonderful 3 cd set . come in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these day . most multi-cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly . not this one . this is a bargain . it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd .
1	this make my heart go pitter-patter . i love this song . it is a beautiful , slow song that just make you feel so good .
0	this is an upbeat relaxing song but not the one i want to fall asleep to .
0	this is a great sounding dubstep song , but i have to say that i do not really like it .
0	embedded drm prevents burning amazon.com downloaded mp3 to a cd . digital player only . i do not recommend these downloads for this reason .
1	i wish i had this album when i wa in high school , i would have loved it . the song is beautiful , and the chorus is amazing . a an added note , i think the song wa one of the best song ever written for a pop album . the song is a nice combination of folk and pop , and the chorus is catchy . the song is a little different than most song on this album , but it is very well played and performed . it is one of the very best song i have ever heard .

1	excellent album by christopher cross . i bought extra copy for friend .
1	10 year is one of my favorite band . you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work . while i still prefer autumn effect , this album is solid , but that is not surprising at all . i really do not think 10 year is capable of producing crap . their music and the vocal are just too good . : )
1	i thought this wa pretty cool . i downloaded it because i heard a guy say that it wa one of his favorite song . i do not normally download music , but i wanted to try it ; i liked the song , but maybe it is too early for me .
1	this song rock .
0	wow i wish they stop playing this garbage on the radio by now ! even for a 8 minute song ? this guy is just desperate to keep his career going . he need to look himself in a mirror cause the music flatout suck .

0	? this song suck .
1	i am not surprised that this song is stuck in the top 10. it is a really good song . it is definitely part of the yikes ! sound . the whole band just seem to have a lot of energy and a lot of energy make for a good song .
0	: i have been downloading music to my ipod for about five year . i started from the time i got my first computer , and have been downloading music to the ipod every day since then . it is also my way of listening .
1	would let me play the song .
0	what the others say is true . i bought this cd back in the early ninety . i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp . no stereo and one song play faster than it should . i have the original mercury stereo lp ( all track were stereo except one ) . just an fyi , the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version . you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube . search for diane ray stereo .
1	first off i must say i am a huge fan of bob dylan , so when i heard this album i wa very excited ! i wa excited because of the songwriting , the emotion and the production skill . the whole thing just seemed like a work of art . the lyric were fantastic and the production wa incredible . dylan ha always written his song with such passion , and i love that he ha always delivered them with such intensity . the production on this one wa really phenomenal . i love the way he us the guitar and the string and the way the vocal are mixed together . this album is a masterpiece . there is so much emotion in this one , and it just take you away from the everyday world of thing . the production wa great and the song were written beautifully . i really loved this album . i am glad i have this cd and i will be checking it out again .
0	excellent acoustic guitar work and a fantastic melody .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable .
1	good song for a change . the song is good and is a good choice for the album . the backing vocal are great and the chorus is great ! it ` s a great song !
1	i love it and i love your voice . i love the lyric and how they make me feel . i just want to be you . i just want to be you .
0	christmas is always about the true meaning of love .

1	this is one of my favorite song .
1	this album came a a
0	this is the first david soul album by me . i first heard of this album when i saw the volvo commercial for it . i wa very impressed and i wanted to check out this album . i have enjoyed every single song , but i have never really got into it . it wa a nice listen that i will probably end up buying again one day .
0	i wa surprised with how much of a hit this song became . it a very catchy song , and a must have for anybody with a hiphop playlist .
1	while i am on a roll with the new release , i wanted to go back to one of my favorite album from the early 90 . the sound of music is a great movie and this is a great album , but i have never been a big fan of liza minnelli . if you have heard my review of the album , you know that i wa a huge fan of the movie . she is just not for me . the song from this album are great , but i just can not get into the album . it is too mildred pierce for me . i think if you are a fan of this movie , or if you are looking for something new to listen to , you will probably enjoy this album . i hope you enjoy it .
0	i am really not sure to give this a good review . i can not really say i liked this album . the sound is pretty much what you would expect from a punk band , the guitar is not something you want to listen to for too long , and the lyric are pretty much the same every time you listen to it . i do not think this is a good band . i probably would not have listened to this even if it wa a good album .
0	*
0	this is a terrible product .
0	lost is right , this disc being the covermount ( not for resale ) disc from classic rock magazine issue 103 , march 2007. it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time , overlooked gem and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan . ummm . well part of that plan ha been achieved . they are certainly curio . curio from the realm of apathy generation . because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track .
1	this song is good . it is a good love song . it is a good song . it is a good song .
1	after i saw her standing there the beatles went into a creative cul de sac . they were struggling to find a way to make good music . they had the song lucy in the sky with diamond on their first album , but it wasnt a hit . they then made please please me , which wa a hit , and then they made from me to you , which did not do well , but then they made i am the one which did well and then they made yesterday which did pretty well and then they made nowhere man which wa really good , but it did not do a well a they had hoped .

0	i just ordered this cd through amazon , so i have not had a chance to listen to it yet , but it is very well produced . the cd sound very professional and i am very excited to listen to it . i am a fan of the americana , bluegrass , and americana sound , and this band ha a lot of that feel to it . this is going to be a great addition to the collection of my friend and i .
1	i love this song . i love to sing
0	the lyric are great but my least favorite song on the album
1	i never expected to be so enamored with this album . the song sound like they are going to be on the radio for year to come . i never realized how much i missed the classic rock sound . the song are on a higher level and the lyric are better than any of the other album i own .
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo , did not like it since it wasnt . i wa after hers not someone el .
1	this is an excellent song . i love the lyric , and i love the music . i just wish the lyric were more memorable and the music more memorable . i will be home tomorrow is a great song . i will be home tomorrow is a great song .
0	what can i say ? it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album . apparently , there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here . what complete jibberish . how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release ? while i would love to say i am shocked mr .
0	the song is a nice , positive , upbeat tune that everyone love . the vocal are high , and the bass is very good . the only negative comment is that the song is repetitive . i think the singer said there are 9 different version of the song . that is a real negative . i like the song and would really like to hear it again .
0	some of the song are great , but many of the song are a bit too commercial for me .
0	this is one hell of an album . what a wonderful gift .

1	another song about the pain of the loss of a loved one . it is a good representation of the loss we face in life , even though it is only a short song .
1	i like this cd . i like the guitar that play in the background , and the vocal are nice and pleasant .
0	when you use a program , it is important to know what it is . this one ha an option to run a program a a standalone , but it doe not know how to run program in other folder . it is an abomination . when you click on this program , the first menu you see ha a list of program in that folder . not in your home folder . nowhere . if you click on the one in your home folder , it pop up a menu that give you a list of program and you can click on the one you want to run . if you click on the program folder in the program list , it give you a list of program in that folder . if you click on the one in your home folder again , it give you a list of those program in that folder . it doe not tell you how to run the program you clicked on in the program list . this is the only problem with this program . another one ha the option to run a program a a standalone program , but that program ha no help file , and it ha no documentation .
0	i agree with the other review . this album is great . it is very good . this is my second time with this album . it is my favorite so far . i love the album . i will buy it again . i have listen to it many time . it is my favorite album . i will buy it again . i have not purchased any other album in a long time . i like this album . i will buy it again . i have listened to this album many time . i like the music and vocal . i will buy it again . i like the album .

1	except for a kiss a long a eternity , which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register , and is a very successful song , most of the track on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song , with vitas singing usually in a middle register . track 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 were co-written by vitas , track 8 , 10 and 11 written by him alone . total playing time is 36:15. i simply adore this cd . it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy , enthusiasm and love .
1	i love this song . it wa one of my favorite song from the movie .
1	the song would have let me download the
0	this song is one of the first time i have been able to listen to a hip hop song that actually sound bad . most hip hop song are so good , you forget about the horrible part . this song is the opposite of that , in fact . this song is pretty good , and i actually enjoy it . i wa surprised to learn that it wa written by the same guy who wrote you will never walk alone from the go-goos . i do not know why the go-goos released you will never walk alone , but i figured that it wa probably a bad song , so i kept it for myself . the song is basically about the you will never walk alone syndrome . everyone ha it , but it is never really spoken about . this song is one of the first time i have been able to listen really honestly to the song you will never walk alone . it is like hearing a song about the you will never walk alone syndrome in the middle of a song about sex . that is how it ha to sound , and that is why the song is bad . the only positive thing about this song is that the chorus is good . the chorus is pretty good and it is got a nice chorus . the song is repetitive too , so the song is at it worst when it repeat itself , which is when the song is good . the whole song is repetitive , but the chorus is good .

1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every .
1	i wa very surprised when i first heard this song . it is unlike any song i have ever heard , and the arrangement is very unique . it is very much a song about a young lady who ha fallen in love with a man who is not a romantic a she is . the piano melody is not played by a piano . she sings the melody by herself , in a high-pitched singsong fashion that is not at all like a ballad . i am very glad i discovered this song . i have not heard anyone play it better .

1	some people think the video is too violent or that the band is not a good live band . but it is not just that . i think that if the fan wanted to see a band that played real music and not just a couple of singer with loud mouth . the fan did not want this . you can hear this on the album cover , the lyric to the song voodoo and the album itself . the band doe play real music .
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat . others are not so great , but they may grow on me . ( but not that one about bird . ) i am just happy paul is digging out some gem and recording them in an inspired way . if it take romance to make that happen , so much the better .
1	i actually liked this album . i did not think it wa a good a other alex clare album , but it wa more enjoyable . it did not bother me a much a other album he ha put out . the song were all interesting and the voice were different and made for a unique listening experience .
1	i think this is one of the best album of all time , for me . every time i listen to it , i get a different experience . i am happy , happy , happy that i found this album !
0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol . i had heard this song on the radio ( probably too much ? ) and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today . i have to say i like the song , but the ending is really [ . ] . of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general , but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability .
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine , cultural mix and personal transformation . loved it !
0	i love this song . i love the word and the melody .
0	not a great a his previous cd , some great tune but mostly a disappointment . i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp3 would best suit you .
1	i love it . i love how he say , i sing it all day every day . not even an average song would be able to do that ! i love how he doe not get upset when he sings a song that is not his . i love how he tell u that he would have joined the military year earlier had he made the right choice . i love how he tell u he is not a religious person but he doe pray . i love how he sings i love that song over and over again . i love that he say he would have joined the military earlier . i love it that he doe not think god is in control of our life . i love that he say he is not religious at all , but he doe pray . i love that he sings the same song over and over again . i love his story in the song ( which is not even about him ) . i love that he think he sings because he want to be an example to others . i love how he tell u he doe not want to be a burden . i love how he tell u he is not religious , but he doe pray . i love that he sings the same word over and over again . i love that he talk about how it wasnt easy growing up in a broken home , but he overcame the obstacle and became successful . i love that he say he is not religious , but he doe pray . i love that his story in the song is not about him . i love that he tell u he doe not want to be a burden . i love it ! i love that he sings i love that song over and over again . i love that he tell u he doe not want to be a burdensome burden . i love that he tell u he doe not want to be an example to others . i love that he tell u that he did not make the right choice , but he did overcome the obstacle and become successful . i love that he tell u that he is not religious , but he doe pray . i love how he sings i love it over and over again . i love that he tell u he doe not want to be burdensome , but he is not a burden . i love that he tell u he doe not want to make an example for others . i love that he tell u that he doe not like to sing , but he enjoys doing it .
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch . i would seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he would written the song for him . it wa kind , and touching , and the song itself wa great . look for another year at massey hall , i am !
0	i hope this song is played some time at christmas .

1	this song is a good choice for the summer . i love this song and i like to listen to it when i need to cheer myself up and for the great melody i like to listen to it on the beach .
0	while , at 99 cent , the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance , buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly : it is drastically ( and clumsily cut ) . we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field , but not the marvelous aria that follows . and his yoke is easy , his burden is light , along with he shall feed his flock is also missing .
1	very cool , i love the idea of the new music . i think there are some great song and the first few tune on the album are really good . i thought the song were well written and had unique , memorable melody and rhythm .
0	i wa very dissapointed with the speed sleep product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very annoying . once you buy it you are stuck with it .

1	i decided to buy this cd after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i decided to buy this album . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever bought to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the beat and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas i am going on the ocean is a rock anthem to evening activity . i am not a fan of the new stuff .
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe , this song is not only catchy , but powerful and sang really well . i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over . excited for the full album !
1	this cd of this group is incredible . the music is great and the only cd that i would buy again .

0	this album will take you to a different place . if you like dark and edgy music this is the album for you .
1	i think this is my favorite of the three album by the band , i have just recently received the deluxe version and have had to listen to it to be sure what i am going to write here because the album is so great . the song are amazing and they have a very unique sound . the first song is dancing in the dark which is a very upbeat song which ha the feel of a song like love shack by the beatles or i am the walrus by pink floyd . i have to say that my favorite song is one life which is a fast paced song about the struggle you have to make it in this world . i love the melody and the lyric . the song goodbye mr. blue is very soft and ha a beautiful arrangement that make the song stand out . the song the last train is the ending of the album and it is sad but it make a statement about the state of the world . i think that this album is a very good representation of their style and they have done a great job . i recommend this album to all of my friend and family . it is a must have for anyones collection .
1	i have been listening to this song on repeat . it is a very catchy song and a good representation of the style of old-style rock music . i like the piano solo a well , the vocalist ha a nice voice , and the guitar solo is awesome .

0	this song is great , i really like this singer song writer .
0	i love rihannas music . this album is amazing .
0	a great tribute to frank sinatra . this wa a very well written tribute to frank sinatra . the word were well chosen and the singing wa very good . i would have liked to see a little more of the vocal range of frank sinatra . i do not think the arrangement wa a good a the original . i think the arrangement would have been better if it had been a duet .
1	i love a band that can bring different style to an album without sounding like a cover band . i am a huge fan of this band and i have been for a long time . it is a great album with a great sound .
0	this is not a great cd . i do not think i will ever buy another of these , and i do not use it frequently ( i have it on a shelf somewhere , but it is not really in use ) . i do not think it is worth $ 10 , plus shipping .

1	i love this the most . i love this song !
1	a lot more singing . it really brings out the emotion in this song . it is really good .
0	i do not think i have ever heard any album so bad . it is a joke . i do not care if they are popular , i do not like their music . there is nothing really special in this album . it just sound like the type of trash they would play in a bar . the album is only about 45 minute long and the song are all over the place . this is a really bad album .
1	this is a great album , but i thought it would be better .
0	radiohead suck
1	i love this cd ! it is a very good band . i like their live show and the fact that they play so many cover . this is a very solid effort from them .
0	i think it is a good album , and i think it is a good way to start the year . the song do not really stand out , but that is part of the reason i like it . i think it doe start the year off with a bang , and i think lemmy should be proud of that .
0	i like this .
1	the sound is rich , the harmony are deep , the arrangement are original . i have played it many time and recommended it to friend .
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music - and i have not yet heard all of her 1990s-era release ( because they are a little difficult to find . ) but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s fall into the pop and light jazz genre , i get the impression that for hetero her manager ( or producer , whatever , ) wa trying to nudge her into alt-rock , that tane herself wa more interested in .
0	i did not like this song for a number of reason . it is a real song that never had a chance to be complete on the album . it is not much of a song and it is not much of a lyric . i thought it wa a very bad song .
0	i love this album . it is a very good album .
1	this song ha got to be one of the best song on the album . great lyric , great lyric , great song .
0	sample track sounded great , but when you listen to the entire cd it is one monotonous song after another . had high hope for this , but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune . probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it .
0	a great little car song .
1	this song talk about the pain and suffering of a lost love . i think this song is a great reminder of how you should feel about someone you love . it say that when you are sad or angry that you should forgive that person and not judge them . this song is very simple and very powerful . it also show how you should not judge someone just because they are different or if they are different than you . the song talk about how you should forgive people who are different and that we should not judge someone just because they are different .
0	this album is very good , and the band is very good . i love this album . i like this album very much .
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording . the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell . who doe not like sleigh bell ? i like it !
1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version ever done !
1	i am just trying to stay up to date on the music industry . that being said , i have always found this music to be great . it is not that i hate it , i just do not like how it is overproduced and overhyped .
1	this cd wa awesome
1	blink 182 is a very good song . it is really catchy it is fun . i like it . the song is really good and the song is really catchy . it is really good .
0	i bought this on amazon because the song is so catchy , i thought i could download it . this is not the type of song i want my kid to listen to . my son would make a face when i play this song . i would like to know why they do not include the chorus in this song . they could have just left the chorus out .
1	i think this song is awesome . i think it is a very catchy song . i think it is cool . i think i love it . it is catchy . i like it . i think it is cool . i think i love it . i like it . i love it . i like it . i like it . i love it ! i love it ! i love it ! i love it ! i love this song !
0	my son brought home his 3-year-old daughter for the first time this weekend . after a short visit , he came to pick her up and she wa already asleep . when he returned to the car to drive away , he found that her face and body had become contorted in a manner only seen on the human body in slow motion . when he stopped , his daughter body would twist violently from side to side , making it look like someone wa pulling on her arm and face in a slow motion manner . he pulled over and got out of the car to walk her to the back door of the house , but she wa no longer even moving . he immediately called 911 , but there wa no one at the house . he then called the police to the neighbor and asked them to help , but they were too far away . he called the doctor to the hospital to have her checked out , but she wa still unresponsive at the hospital . he then called the school to see if there wa anything they could do , but it wa too late . when i heard about this , i knew she wa dead .

1	the astonishing is a really great album . one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of hearing . this album is a lot heavier than most of the album i have heard from the band . i really like this one . i think it is a great album from dream theater .
0	this is my favorite of the album , and i am a huge fan of josh groban . it is beautifully arranged , and i really enjoy the vocal . i would like to hear a duet with josh groban .
0	great album .
0	i liked this song until i watched the video . come on . then robin thicke got twerked on by miley . ugh . while his wife played it cool for a while , eventually she left him . and finally he say he ha addiction issue . am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer/actors personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song/movie ? ( see : anything by amy winehouse ; all thing brad pitt , gwyneth paltrow or rihanna )
0	this is an album of great composition , but i do not think they are that great . the originality and creativity of the composition is only fair , but the execution is not outstanding . there is a pianistic piece by gershwin on the first side , but the other song on the album are not a well chosen . also the sound quality is not great and my cd player is not very good . i am not a big fan of the music so i do not want to waste money on this album .
1	i love this album . so far , i have only heard this album once . the album ha a great sound . i had a lot of fun when i heard this . the album is very good . the sound is very good .
1	i loved this song a soon a i heard it ! i purchased it last year , and have been playing it constantly ever since . it is so catchy and ha a very positive message . i think you should consider putting it on your list of song to buy .
0	the first album by a band i have heard in what feel like forever . these guy are going to need to be bigger than they are to get the recognition that they have achieved .
0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing it is not the original .
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
0	i hate not having a portable mp # file . i either own the music or i do not ? i do not listen to these tune on my computer !
0	i really like this song . i like the movie too . my husband like the movie . i think it is a great song and i hope it is used a a single .

0	this is a great album , and i can listen to it for hour on end .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
1	i love everything about this band . when they play , i am not going to be able to look away . they are so good that i can not imagine their playing another show . the singer is fantastic . the song choice is great . the setlist is great . and their performance wa outstanding . they have a reputation for playing well-sung , high-energy , rock song . but the first time i saw them , i wa not expecting to like them . i wa expecting to hate them . but then , when they played , it wa amazing . they were great . my only complaint is that they did not play from the radio broadcast . but again , i have gotten this album from cd , cd , cd , cd , cd , cd , cd , cd , and i have gotten it from tape , tape , tape , tape , tape , tape , tape , tape , and i have gotten it from cassette . and , every time i have gotten it , it ha been the best copy that i have ever received . i think that this is the best cd that i have ever gotten . it is the best copy of their cd that i have gotten . it is the best copy of their cd that i have ever gotten .
0	this album is a decent weezer album .
0	this is the only cd i have ever owned where i actually have to put the music on a i read the book . the book is more fun than the cd and the cd is a great way to listen to the music during the story .
0	this wa not my favorite version . i liked the original better . i like it better . i like it better . i really like this version . it is beautiful and romantic . i really like it .
0	! what is wrong with this crap .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable .

0	i love this song . i wa so excited to listen to it on my ipod , but my ipod wa not working so i had to use the computer . i am so happy that i could download this song and listen to it on the computer .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
1	a great album with great performance .
0	i am not a huge chris brown fan but he is a good musician . this song ha a great beat and it is one of the best song on this album . but the lyric are terrible and it is one of the worst song on this album . there are better song for him to sing , but that is why he is a great singer . not to mention he ha a great voice . he is a great singer and can sing in a good range . but his lyric are terrible . and i am not the only one that think so . the other song are bad too . all of them , including the cover version , are bad . but this song is better then the others . and it is better the second time i hear it . and the last time i heard it it wa good . it is a good song . i really like it . i can even sing along with it . that is something chris brown doe not have . now , i can hear myself singing along with it too . i hope chris brown doe not get famous . and i hope he doe not sing this song . it is a disaster .
0	i received this cd a a christmas gift . i really like it . it is worth the money . i am not usually a fan of the new van morrison but there is a lot of good music on this cd . it is also good music to listen to while watching a movie .

0	it is a good cd but i can not understand all the word .
1	a great song !
0	this album wa a complete train wreck . the production is awful . the singing is horrible . the lyric are horrible . i wa forced to buy the album after i wa insulted by the comment people made about it . this album is a waste of resource and time . the only reason i am even buying this album is to see how bad it really is . at least i still have the cd of i am alright . i will be buying this album by the truckload .
0	i first heard this on the radio and then i bought it . i have not heard it on the radio but when i heard this song i fell in love with it . i wa a little disappointed about the song , because it is so upbeat and fast paced . even though i love the song , i am going to pas it by .
1	if you like the music of the 60 , then you will enjoy this album . although i am not a big fan of the group , this is one of the few recording that i actually like . the vocal are great , and the music is very good . the original score is great , and the song are very catchy .
0	i like this band . i like the first album . i like the second album . i would recommend this album to those who like country music . i have enjoyed this band . i have enjoyed this band .
1	my family always sings this song when getting ready for bed . it is a good way to wind down at the end of the day . thanks for sharing !
1	i like the song , but i also think that it is a little repetitive . i think it is a lot better to have it a one of the song on the album and leave the others to have a more individual style .
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it

0	this ha to be one of the most underrated song on the album - i love this song , and a a whole , this album is great ! it is very laid back , but is very enjoyable and ha a great message that need to be heard .
1	it will find any text file on your computer that ha a comma , a dash , or a space in it . it will find any text file that ha a period and a comma in it . it will find any text file on your computer that ha an apostrophe in it . it will find any text file on your computer that contains the word algebra in it

1	i loved this album and am now a fan . this is a great album .
0	i really enjoy this album and i am glad i bought it . a usual , alex doe not do anything too over the top . he seems to have decided to focus more on the original song and to not do a many cover song . this is a fine album , but not something i would go out and buy .
0	this is one of the worst album i have ever heard . i will not listen to it , and i will not waste my time listening to it . i do not understand why anyone would waste their money on this , and i do not know why anyone would let this out of their hand , because i can not imagine anyone else caring enough to waste their time or money on such a bad album .

1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway .
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me . west is another great group of song !
1	thanks for the outstanding service .
1	i really enjoy this cd .
0	i like the beat , the lyric are great and the video is nice . this is one of my favorite song and i hope you can get the cd .
1	this is my favorite joe augustine album . i bought it when his label put it out . the album wa very good and now i listen to it over and over .
1	a very good song . it is about a guy who is a musician and he want to see how good he can be . he get a job and he go
0	disc 2 of this digital audiobook is damaged . i tried downloading it a couple time , but it always skip repeatedly after about 23 minute into that disc . this is the equivalent of selling a new paper book with missing/ripped page . unacceptable .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
0	this song is one of his best .
0	!
0	i like this version of the song . it is a very good version of the song . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . the guitar sound great . the drum are not needed .
0	this song doe not seem to have a message .
1	this is a very great song . i felt it would be really good for worship , and it wa . it wa also very easy to learn .
1	one of the album i pre-ordered wa lonely boy , which wa my dream album . i finally got to hear the album and i thought it wa great . the fact that the album wa recorded in the mid-2000s made it even better .
0	i like this song , i like the video , i like the fact that she is a mom , but i can not stand this song . she is singing in a deep voice . i feel like i am hearing a little girl sing and i am hearing a grown woman sing . it is so annoying !
1	the song is gone , but it is not the song with the chorus ( it is the song with the bridge ) but it is the song with the chorus . this song is a great little jam song and i would say that it is a good representation of what you are going to get if you are looking for david archuleta live in the studio .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
1	i really like this song ! it wa an amazing song ! i would like to hear it again !
0	i am not a big fan of rap music a i find it to be very dumbed down and not very intelligent at all . however , i did enjoy this album . it wa interesting to hear some of the sound that i wasnt familiar with before . it is really good to hear a band with a unique sound like this and not just a bunch of rapper trying to rhyme . i would recommend this album to those who like rap but do not like it very much .
0	i have had this album on for over a week and i can not say i have noticed a difference in my listening . at most , it is a little bit quicker than i wa expecting . i do not understand the hype about this album . i thought it wa going to be more like their previous work , but it is not . it is not bad , it is just not really worth listening to . i am sure there is a lot more to it than the average person realizes , but i can not find it . i can not wait to listen to the rest of their discography , but i can not take a chance on this one . i do not know why there wa a 10 in the review , because it clearly is not worth the price .
1	this is a good cd .
0	this cd is a slight improvement over the previous one . this is not an original track , but it is a nice tribute and will remind you of the dark side of the moon album a little .
0	this album is one of the best hard rock album i have ever heard . it ha everything that i love in a music album . it is just that everything is good .
1	ive never been a huge fan of rime , but this cd wa amazing . i bought it a few week ago , and it wa amazing . rime is one of my favorite artist . and after listening to this cd , i would agree . i just wish the cd wa a little longer .
1	this song ha a good beat , well written lyric and beautiful music . i really enjoy the way that the song is mixed together . it ha a great message . i love that you can hear the different instrument in the song . i think it ha a good message . i like the way that you had different instrument in the song . the song also make me cry , which i love . i think that it is great !
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song .
0	this song only make me want to kill myself .
1	this is a very good cd to buy .
0	nothing good worth mentioning but picture perfect ! .that tracc with brandy wa o.k an dumb s * t shouldve been without snoop an blacc ty .
1	this is yet another excellent cd . it is better than the first one and the sound is excellent .
1	this is a great song .
0	i am a huge fan of the band , so i went into this album very optimistic . but once i started to listen to it , i realized that i wa not going to be able to enjoy it . not because of the singer performance , but because of the music itself . it wa really not that bad . i do not like the music style , though i understand it .
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality .

1	i love the beatles and i love this album . what i do not like is that this album sound like it wa recorded in a garage . you know , there is a lot of electric guitar . the electric guitar sound like they have been playing for a while . there is a lot of electric guitar feedback in this album . the vocal sound like they have been recorded in a garage . it doe not have any bass line in it- ever . that is what i do not like . and then , to top it all off , the lyric are terrible . like , what is the point of writing a song called i want to see you tonight if you can not actually sing it ? what is the point of writing an album called i love you if you can not actually play a tune ? this is an awful song . and the lyric are awful . i want to see you tonight . that is it . that is the whole song . i love you . that is all i need . who writes song like that ? these are song that all the people who listen to this album , they can not really sing , right ? let me go . there is no point in saying that you want to go .
1	i have been listening to this band for a few year now and have never been disappointed . their music always put me in a great mood , and they are able to mix the genre together very well . their music is fresh and fun to listen to . they have great lyric and good vocal . i really can not wait for the band to release a new album , so i will be listening to this album a lot .
0	this song rock , but the guitar solo is too repetitive .
1	i have been a fan of mike shinoda since i wa in middle school , and even though i didnt know he wa in a band , i wa into his music , and i knew it wa his voice that made his music that i liked . his live show were awesome , and i loved his music . i wish that i could have seen him perform on tour , but i wasnt able to . i wa waiting for this cd , and i wa nervous , but this cd is the best version of mike and all his friend on their best song . this cd is so great .
1	i really like this song , but the sound quality is just terrible .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc .
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard dreamboat annie . 36 year later , ann wilson sound even better . wether you are a heart fan , or have never heard the group before , this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll .
1	this song and it lyric are a great example of christian truth . this is not a negative song like many of chris song but rather an honest song of what god ha done in my life . very inspirational . not a big fan of this song , but i really enjoy listening to this song .
0	we had the pleasure of attending this concert , and while not exactly a musical delight , the band doe a great job of bringing their energy across the stage and in their music . my only complaint , to be honest , is that this cd is in japanese only .
1	this is one of the best cd i have seen in a long time , it really brings back many memory in my mind . i will never forget these show .
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp . it is complete with tic and pop . the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording . i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape and wa very disgusted with the sound . my worn cassette copy wa much better . i would give it a zero for the rating if i could . the performance is wonderful and exciting , but badly mangled by the transfer . do not buy this under any circumstance .
1	wow wow wow wow .
0	this is a great song that ha a nice sound to it but the lyric are terrible . this is not a good album and it is not a good cd . i am disappointed with this cd .
0	i have heard a lot of great album over the year , i have never heard of any album that i thought wa a great a this one . i think this is the best album that they have ever released , but that is only because of the cover . the album is over an hour long and i do not think that it is worth a dime . i know everyone ha to have some kind of opinion , but this album is the worst album that i have ever heard .
1	i picked up this record on a whim because i had been wanting to hear new material from dj shadow for a while . but i am not going to lie , this is one of my favorite new release . i have heard a lot of good song from dj shadow , but this one stand out . it is so different and original and fun . i also think it is a perfect record for party . it is just so different from any other record i have heard so far .
1	this started off well ; but it is not all that long , and it seems like cale is at a point in his career where he is more concerned with making a hit ; so the song doe not have that much to offer . it is a very good song , and it is a great way to show how great a vocalist cale can be .
0	if i had been listening to this album while i wa sick , i would have been very happy .
1	the first time i heard this song , i thought it wa a song by the kink . it is got a good beat , but it is not a catchy song . you just know it is going to be a dud . however , it go on to become my favorite song by this artist . it ha a great melody and lyric that are catchy enough . i just wish it wasnt on a mixtape .
1	i liked it a lot , but i actually liked gravity more . i actually liked this song over gravity . it is a little repetitive , but the song is really catchy and easy to dance to .
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness .
1	this rock song make me want to dance .
0	i can listen to any prince album over and over again . some say it is annoying to even hear his music on the radio . but , i like it . it is just not a good a other prince album .
0	this song sound like an old-school version of the song . i am not a fan . i will buy this cd on the off chance that i like it . i have a feeling that it will be a waste of money , but oh well .
0	this song becomes more and more depressing a time go along so i deleted it .
1	this wa a very good album , but i am not a fan of the first album . this one is a great album , if you like rock and roll and good song .
1	this album is very long at about 5 hour . it is a little like a movie with a narrator . i have to turn the volume down but it is great . the music is very original and it is not like any other country music . the narrator is very good . the music is very unique . i am a country fan but i can listen to some variety . i would give it 5 star . the narrator is very good . i would like to know where i can get more of this cd . thanks .
1	this is a very nice song . it ha some lyric that are very difficult to understand , but it is a good song . the music is very relaxing and it is very peaceful . the only thing that bother me about the song is the repetition of the word you a lot , especially in the beginning . it is very easy to get used to the repetition , but it is a little annoying . the repetition of the word you is something that bother me a lot . i would recommend this song to those who like a very relaxing song .
1	i really like this album . it is one of my favorite .
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
1	this album is incredible . i love it . this album is amazing .
1	i love the lyric of this song . the music is great !
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved .
0	i love the song on this cd . i love the song only love can break your heart the best .
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
0	i like this song . it is not my favorite , but it is a very good song .
1	i love to go to a recording studio and listen to music , but i am not a great fan of the classical genre of music . after having listened to this cd , i have become a devoted fan of this genre of music .
0	this is an album of riff , they are catchy and fun . the lyric are also fun and witty . the only thing that is lacking is the instrumentation . it is pretty good , i would listen to it again , and i will . the only thing i would change is to change the name of the song to let u get high & go .
0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
1	this is awesome and a great song . this song is awesome . i love the video . this song is awesome . this song is awesome . it ha been a while since i have listened to this song , but i wa very pleased to listen to it again . this song is awesome . this song is awesome . oh my god , this song is awesome !
0	i do not know why i like this song . i like all of the song , but this is the only one that i have not listened to enough to say that i like it .
1	what an incredible song . i never thought that i would get a positive review for this song but it wa worth it . really worth the money . this song is really , really good . it is one of my favorite . i will always listen to this song , it is great .
0	this song really made me cry .
1	i love this album , especially the ending .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this is a very graphic book and i thought the same thing . i read the book on amazon and i wa surprised to see that the book is censored . the book ha a sex scene in there that is censored and not shown in the movie . i do not know why it wa censored in the first place . the book is graphic and thus it should be reviewed a a whole .
1	i like these guy , they kind of blur the line between pop and rock but somehow still come off a being heavy . they just kind of have a nice old-school feel good rock vibe .
0	if you want an album that is good for the entire family to listen to on sunday you should not buy this album . it ha a lot of good song but it is not really that good . the singing is not that good . i think that if the cd had a second cd that had a lot of good song like ramanavar and door to door the whole album would have been better . the cd is not that long and it is a great album to listen to at your leisure a it is very relaxing and you can listen to it in the car on the way to work and it doe not make you feel like you are in a rush to get home .
0	i have a lot of respect for this band . they have done great thing over the year and i always liked their music . however , i have a lot of respect for this band , but this song is not very good .
0	another song that is not a well known a it should be .
1	this song is one of my favorite worship song . i like the message and the worship , but i would like to have a version with more instrument and the lyric .
0	this is a good album . the best thing about this album for me wa the cover art . it is a very nice album . i will be listening to it a lot in the near future . very well done . it show that there is a lot more to be done in the electronic genre . i am really looking forward to the next album . i will be listening to this album everyday . i like the song the day before .
1	this cd is a wonderful album . it ha a very good mixture of style . i like the way that the guitar is used . it is very exciting . the sound is amazing and it is one of my favorite to listen to . i have loved it for a long time .
0	this is a really good album . i like it .
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer . i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for .
0	i love bob dylan , but this is a very disappointing album .
0	if you are a tango dancer or d.j. , looking for a collection of the most danced-to tango in either the u.s. or argentina , you will be sorely disappointed with this collection . it contains few , if any , of the the essential golden era hit . instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure , non-danced-to , listening-only tango : early gardel , piazzola , etc . that you would almost never want to play at a milonga . calling the collection 50 essential tango is misleading at best .
0	this record wa so bad i did not even bother to listen to it all the way through . it is not worth it . i do not really like this kind of stuff .
0	the song is a great introduction to the band and the music . it really brings out the band strength .
1	i love this song so much ! it is my favorite song on the album . i love the lyric . it is very positive and ha a positive mood to it . i love this song . i find it very inspirational and motivational . it is a very positive song .
1	this version is really good . i like it . i like it a lot . i like it .
1	this is really a great cd .
0	i definitely like prince music . he is an amazing singer and ha great creativity . this album is not up to par with his other album .
1	the first time i listened to this song wa at a friend home and i could not stop singing . the song is very catchy and the piano accompaniment really add to the song . the lyric are very upbeat and are appropriate for the song . i think it is an excellent use of a song .
1	this album is a holiday classic . i love this album . i love this album . i love this album . this album ha been one of my favorite christmas album . it is a classic . i love this album . this album ha everything i love about christmas .
1	great song , but i would have liked more vocal backing . the singer wa fine , but the backing vocal were weak . the song wa short , but not bad .
0	i wa a big fan of o.a.r . back in the late 70 and early 80 . i have been to see them live many many time . this wa the best o.a.r . album i have ever heard . if you are a big fan , i would suggest you do not listen to this album at all . i would give this album a 3 star out of 5 star .
1	this is the best song i have heard from this album so far . the band doe a great job mixing different style of music together . the vocal could be better , but the rest of the album is pretty good .
1	i am totally down for this song . this song is amazing . it truly brings back some joy in my life .
0	it is a good song , but i just do not like it . it is not bad , but it is not great . i would not recommend it to anyone .
0	this is the worst album i have ever heard by the killer . it is completely boring and they do not know what their fan want .
0	i think this album is a great album . i do not think it is a great album , but it is a great album that i do not think would be considered a great album by many people .
0	lucinda is a great artist . she ha a great voice , and she is very talented at playing the guitar .
0	this album is in my opinion one of the worst album of all time . i wa hoping for even one song to be good but they all are so bad and the lyric are a waste of time . i do not bother listening to their music anymore .
0	i like this band a lot . i really like the album .
1	love is alive and well on this album .
1	i love the melody and guitar riff on this song . the guitar loop on this song are so very catchy and it sound like the band is having fun playing this song . the vocal on this song are also really unique , and they sound like they are part of a pop band . i think this song is great
0	i did like this song . i wa surprised that she kept it the same length a the original recording . i actually like it better than some of her other song .
1	excellent recording . i can not stop listening to this . once i bought this , i got all the other master in this series a well .
1	this is the best for the price . i have my son and he love it .
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep . of course the sample that are given do not let you know that . worst 1.99 i have spent . may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window . amazon can do that with it is own money . i will not purchase another music from them .
0	this is a decent album , but not my favorite .
0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .

0	_ _ _ _ _
1	i play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must find it so calming because it work every time : )
1	this is good .
1	i really liked this album ! i really liked it a lot . the beat is really good , and it is very well produced .
1	this is a must buy for dylan fan . i am not going to lie , this is not a dylan fan album . but , i am a dylan fan and i think this is the best dylan album ever .
0	the album is pretty good ( at least it is to me ) and it is catchy and interesting . but i do not recommend it .
1	this is by far the most interesting album i have ever heard . it is got a lot of emotion in it and some of the lyric are very touching .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them . oh well .
1	i have been trying to find a cd that is soothing to the soul for year and the sound of this cd are perfect for my situation . the sound effect are very realistic , and the music is relaxing . i am always amazed at how much i can relax just by listening to this cd .
0	bought for my brother for his birthday . he love metal . he loved this cd . he is a metal fan . it wa awesome . but , not my thing .
0	this review is only for this version of the album ( the remastered expanded edition ) . the mastering sound overly compressed , and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough . the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track . it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album . people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album .
0	it is a good song that i like , but it is not a great song . it just sound like everything else . it is not something i would listen to . it is just a generic song .
0	i do not think this is a good song . it is a great song .
0	i love the music . it ha many different song for every mood .
0	thought i wa downloading the original version . very disappointed .
1	the song is one of roberta flack most memorable song dating back to the seventy when she sang at mr. henry in dc .
0	i love this album , the song are fun and funky and have a great beat , if you like any soul or funk music , then you will like this album . i love this album , the song are fun and funky and have a really great beat , if you like any soul or funk music , then you will like this album .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the amazon downloader
1	this is another fun song from the lion and the cobra . i remember hearing this song on the radio in the mid 1990s and being totally blown away . i always thought that this song wa the greatest song ever . i would have written a full review on it .
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music . it just suck really bad and ha no love in it .
1	can you wait , love this song . have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time . worth the wait .
0	i enjoyed it more when i wa a 16 year old hippie . audio quality wa good . i forgot the rant about god though and that wa enough for me to delete it .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick !
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 time both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album . ( i liked god of war ) . this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy .
0	i have to admit , it is one of my favorite song , but every time i hear it , i cringe .
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of thereal sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
0	this is an interesting album with some interesting tune . very nice .
1	this is a great song ! it is a very fun song !
1	this is the most worshipful worship song i have ever heard ! i love this song !
1	i wa really looking forward to this , and i wa disappointed . i really enjoyed the first album , but the second album wa more to my liking . i feel like the first album wa more of a pop hit , but this one is more like a country hit . the first album ha a more rock feel , but this is more of a country feel to it . the only thing i did not like about the first album is that i thought it wa way too long , i wa hoping it would be longer . i also did not like it at all . this one is a lot better , but not by much . it wa really enjoyable , though . i really enjoyed it , and would definitely buy it again . but i had to make a change . i like the first album better . i like this song better than it is predecessor . i thought the production on the second album wa better , but this one is even better . i think i will buy one more album , a the first one wa so good to me , and i would like to hear more of this band . for some reason i am very upset with this album and i want to like it , but i just do not . i do not have anything negative to say about it . it is a good album . i like it . i just do not like it . it is not the best album , but it is not the worst album either . it is just a good album for me . it is a good collection of song , but it is not the best collection . it is good , but not great . this is a good album , but it is not the best album . i would recommend it to others , though .
1	very good cd , and great for new song .
0	i liked this song . i like it because it is personal and very touching .
1	i really like this song , but i just do not think it is a hit song . i give this song 3 star .
1	i am enjoying the beatles reissue and this is a good one . the song are enjoyable . the production is outstanding . the cover art ha a great look .
1	this is a great album . there is a couple of really nice tune that have a lot of good melody and are pretty long and flowing , but then there are also some really shitty song that just do not have a redeeming story behind them .
1	the cd is a collection of song by many of the most popular artist from the 90 .
0	i would have to give this album a 4. the song on this album are more of a reflection of the emotion of the person singing the song . it is more of a reflection of the person who is singing in general . the album is more in the vein of a solo effort . i am not a big fan of the group song . this is not the case for the solo song . the solo song are very well-written . this is not to say that the group song are poor . each of the group song on this album are good . the only song i did not much like wa the last song on the album , and that wa because it did not sound like the rest of the song on the album . it sounded like a filler song just to fill up time . i know that the album a a whole sound good , but it wa just not a song i wanted to hear on the album .
1	this is the second cd of adam lambert that i have purchased . i love this cd ! the song on this cd are great and i think that the album is well put together .
0	this is a great song , not least because of the lyric . when i listened to it , i wa thinking , how can i play this at the top of the stair in the middle of the night ? but it seemed like i could .
1	this is a really good album . i can not think of anything bad to say about this album . i think it is really good . it is really good . i would buy it again .
0	this is the best cd out there , in my opinion . i always buy the cd from the band and they are great . i do not think i had the best choice in the cd i did though .
1	great album . i have not been a beatles fan since the 60 . i wa introduced to them in 1978 with a live album from a beatles tour and have been a fan ever since . i have been listening to this album every day for the last 2 year and it is my favorite .
0	i could not download this . i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help ! very disappointed
1	this is a great podcast , i really enjoy learning about the music that i do not listen to ( in this case , classical music ) but can not get into .
0	when i first heard this cd , it seemed very similar to the other one , dance for you- just a lot of fun . however , when i got the cd , it wa a lot different . it is not nearly a fun a the other one , but it is a good listen ( and is certainly not a boring a the other one ) .
0	i love this song i.accually searched for two week to find it then i had a brainstorm and used shazzam , and got it that way my 15 month old dance evrytime it come on . luv it .
0	how can the album be 9.99 when the 2 track separately are each.99 ? what kind of price gouging is this ?

1	i am not a huge pink floyd fan , but this song is one of the thing that keep me going . to me , it is a beautiful song that is just not played enough . it is one of those song that is played so often that you almost forget about it . so when i find a song like this that i would like to listen to , i try to make the effort to find it . this song is very nice and not to many people know about it . thanks for sharing it with u . my only complaint is that it is a little too long .
0	i bought this in hope that it wa a live album . i wa hoping to see all the song . but , ala , i did not . it is a great album , but the song are rather repetitive . this is definately not a live album .
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
1	i do not know why , but i like this song . i do not know what it is , but i like it .
1	one of my top 10 favorite worship album of all time . this is an album that is full of worshipful song . the album ha a great message and is full of worshipful song . the album ha a great message and full of worshipful song . this is a great worship album and one of my top 10 favorite worship album of all time !
1	this album is probably the best blue album ever . i can not believe that anyone would listen to this blue album .
0	this album is one of the best in the genre , and i have heard it recommended by friend and family . i would not call it a classic , but it is very enjoyable . i do not think that it is a must have , but i would certainly recommend it to people .
1	good album . the sound is not so great , but i am guessing that wa a mistake . lyrically , i really enjoyed the song . i would say that i liked the music better than the sound . i also really enjoy chris ballew . the first song is definitely a highlight . his voice is smooth sounding , it is very strong . i could hear him singing and singing without having to turn the volume up . that is a plus for me .
0	i do not want to give a negative review here , but this book is very sexualized and thus i feel the book should be reviewed a a whole . the sex scene are extremely graphic , yet the author claim the sexual scene are all consensual . i also believe that some of the scene are not consensual in nature . the sex is very graphic a well . the author also state that she is bisexual , yet she wa not shown in any way having sex with anyone . i feel that she is only showing herself having sex with herself .
0	this cd is a good version of the song . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . i like this cd a lot . the guitar sound great . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio . however , the drum are not needed . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio . the vocal are good . the vocal are great . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio .
1	this album is a classic in my opinion . i like the way it sound and the band is good .
1	this song is excellent , just like the album . this is a very nice song . this is a great song and i like it . this is a great live version of the song . i love the live version better than the studio version .
0	i wish i could give this album le than a star . the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good review on this garbage . snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple . josh will soon have his child do kid bop christian album for sure . if i were amazon or any other business i would block josh from all other future endeavor .
1	this album is really good . i like the song on the album .
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied .
1	my favorite song of chris tomlins . this song is an excellent example of how he can combine a variety of musical style into a cohesive whole . i would imagine that after listening to this song that most people would be inclined to listen to any of his other song that he ha released . this is probably one of his best , and most fun song .
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it ha been for her work with american idol , and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split . but for her latest single , she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before , and fails to do it on papi , the third single from her album love ? the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career .
1	this is such a great album . you got ta check it out !
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl record on youtube and nearly fell over when i started listening . she is absolutely incredible and ha affected me more than any artist in year !
1	this cd wa great . i love it .
0	thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software . i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so , or ever heard of the artist . very generic song , no redeeming quality for me . sound like just about everything else out there .
1	this is a good song , and it is very similar to the song i have been singing to myself recently . i would like to hear more song from her and that includes a
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
1	i recommend this cd for all of my friend and family .
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .
0	i love the album , but skip this loud , over-the-top , obnoxiously sung song every time . it is definitely something bad . bad for my ear .
0	i love these song but the quality of
1	*
0	the song ha no rhythm at all . i can not even sing along to it . the sound quality is bad on the cd
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
1	this is a must have album for anyone that love bluegrass or americana music . the album is well produced , ha great artwork , and is full of very interesting and memorable song . this cd is a great way to start off another year . i will be purchasing another album soon .
1	this is a great album . good for all age .
1	this is an awesome album . i love it ! every song is great and you will definitely enjoy it .
1	i can not believe that the album did not hit a whole lot harder and faster . and i can not believe that they were able to get such a great sound with the technology that they had . they were able to put together a great album with a great sound , but they did not do it with their usual style .
0	while i love the cd , it would not play on our cd player for some reason . i tried it on my son player and it worked . the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it . maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed ? i do not know . disappointed ! : (
0	i bought this cd to listen to the other song and to see what alex wa doing .
1	it would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of jennis father geoff and an admired of her mother , maria . so . those question are answered . a for the cd and jenni on her own , this is a well thought out , highly listenable and original album . it ha been playing on my equipment for several year now , and wear well . enjoy .
1	this song is very boring . i do not like music that is just boring .
0	
0	this song wa just ok .
0	the kiss song calling is a staple of the kiss catalog and certainly not a bad song . it is , however , an uninspired choice for a song to be covered . i would have preferred a song by someone like the eagle or even just a cover ( a version of when you were young by the eagle would have fit the bill ) or a cover of do not let me down by the eagle .
1	very enjoyable , very relaxing , very good vocal for a laid back and relaxing album
0	i love this song .
0	the two album are not in the same order a they appear in the amazon listing .
1	this is a very happy song . it is a nice cover of the old hit do not let the sun go down on me . i did not know about this song before i purchased it . it is not very difficult to play , but you will have to work hard to learn it .
1	i heard this song once and i fell in love with it . i have not heard it for many , many year , but i hear it in my head on a regular basis . this version is even better than i remember it . it is a great song with great music . it is a great song for a birthday or anniversary gift .
0	this is a good album . - i am not a fan of this band music .
0	i wa disappointed with this collection . it wa a collection of song by a radio station . i found this while searching for song by elton john . some of the song were interesting , some were not . the production is good and the song are very well written . i give the album 3 star .
1	the only reason to listen to this is the fact that the song the grinch song is very well done . the vocalist wa thurl ravenscroft . the rest of this album is just old , worn out , worn out , and worn out song that have gone
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation i have heard . this ha nothing to do with gospel . it is a mix-match of melody , poorly played .
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one . careful - most of the review here are for the 1994 broadway revival - which give high mark . this mp3 recording is for the 2008/9 london revival . the london recording is dreadful - truly awful . carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung . give this one a miss . try any of the others you find here instead . in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back .
1	a good mix of common song from merry england ! - i particularly enjoyed the sound of a man from the 16th century bemoaning all of the progress and newfangled fashion that were destroying the heart of the england he knew .
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles , and today diva , she ha became the most overexposed product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song . but nevertheless , when she wa a part of destiny child , she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart . her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work , and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay-z .
0	you can not put this song on the radio .
1	love the music , but it is just not the same a the original .
1	this cd is awesome . i like the cd and her voice . the cd is great . i love her voice and the cd is great . i have listened to this cd a few time and i like it . i like the song and the girl singing it .
0	. which is not saying much since i got this a a freebie ! since this wa free , i decided to download it for kick . sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse a the song progressed . while his diction wa good ( hence , the extra -star rating ) , it still did not make up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness ( going either sharp or flat - usually flat ) - and i still have no real idea what the song wa all about ! actually , i am rather glad i got this a a free download .
1	i had never heard of this artist before and i love them . the lyric are very good and the music is really very good . i do not know why i am not sold on it right away . i just wish i had more positive music .
0	this is one of the worst christmas cd i have ever listened to .
1	the album had good content , but the song were horrible .
1	this is amazing . i love it ! the only problem is that the album is so short , which seems to be the case with most beatles album .
0	
0	this song get a little boring . the guitar riff is cool and the backing vocal are cool . when the backing vocal come in it is hard to hear the guitar playing for a second .
0	i do not know what to say .
0	i just hope they do not make a remake of this song . i love this song and i can not believe it wa written by a girl who is completely in love with her boyfriend .
0	my first impression of this album wa good . i like a lot of the song on this album . the first song i listened to wa the battle of los angeles which is one of the heaviest song on the album . i liked how the band did a cover of the battle of los angeles and the battle of los angeles wa extremely heavy . the second song i listened to wa you are the reason which is one of the slower song on the album . however , i really liked the song and would recommend it anyway . the third song i listened to wa one in a million which feature the best vocal on the album . i wa a little confused at first because the vocal were so high . however , after a few listens , the vocal on that song were much better . there are a few other slower song on the album , but i did not really like the slow song . still , they are decent song . the fourth song i listened to wa the light at the end of the tunnel which is a really good song . the fifth song i listened to wa the light at the end of the tunnel . it is one of the slower song on the album . i wa not a fan of the song until i got to the bridge , and then i really began to enjoy the song . the last song i listened to wa the light at the end of the tunnel , but i wa not a big fan of that song until the last few second . i like this album a lot , but i do not think it is the best album volbeat ha ever made .
0	i had to get this cd because i know that the song are awesome , but the quality is so bad that i decided to get another album , which i did .
1	this song ha definitely stood out in my itunes library . it is great that the band is playing a slow tempo on this song . i like that the band is playing the music in the song . this song would definitely be played at a slower tempo for these older song . this song wa also played at a slower tempo on a recent live performance . this is a strong song on this album .
1	this is definately not the best o.a.r . album . i have seen them live many time , and this album is not even close . there are good song , but not the best . i believe that this album is a little better than one of the best album that o.a.r . ha ever put out . i will give this one a 4 star out of 5 star .
1	pretty good album . love the option to download and get cd for almost the same price
1	this album is a great album . i really enjoy this album . it is very very good . this is one of my favorite album .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this song is pretty good . the song itself is okay . it is a great cover , and it is definitely a great song . i just wish it wa a little more upbeat .
1	a very positive song . she is very talented .
1	brilliant ! i have not seen the show ( hope to , some day ) but the music alone is phenomenonal !
0	i do not know what ha happened to radiohead , but they have become a joke . i can still enjoy a song , but it seems like they are just trying to do a little a possible . the lyric are great , and the music is perfect , but the vocal are a sham . i can never get into the sound of their voice . the beat are okay , but the hook are so cliche and predictable . it is a bit depressing . if they want to take themselves seriously , they should at least try to make the vocal sound more interesting .
1	this is a great song .
0	i have always thought that the best of bon jovi wa richie sambora a he show u in his two previous job . but on this album i see the worst of the song of bon jovis last album . on the other hand , the sound of this cd is very noisy , like the style of some album of the 70 . in short , and for not doing more blood , this cd can be summarized a a couple of good song from a handful of bad and noisy song .
1	this is about the best christmas cd i have ever heard
0	i wa hoping maybe this would be a double feature . but it is not . i wa hoping for a second screen that could show me the bonus feature . but it is not . i will take a pas on this .
1	the album is a classic with a great rock sound . this album is a must have for fan of the band .
0	this album is a complete nightmare . it is a collection of song that are almost identical to each other just with different chord , and the drum are all the same . and there is one song called i love the way we rock that is actually pretty lame because it is guitar hero by a band that doe not really have any other song and doe not even have the right chord to be called a rock band .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
0	i am not into heavy metal , but this album is pretty good . the lead singer sound pretty good . i think that the lyric are not a bad a they could be , but there is not much variety in the song .
1	i love this album . not only is it great , but it is very unique . i would say that it is worth buying .
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
1	i love all of the christmas song . i also enjoy listening to christmas music . there is something about hearing christmas music that make me feel happy .
0	*
1	classic , yet unique .
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	the best version of the standard .
1	i think the only flaw
0	i want to buy this album and put it on my ipod . this album is amazing . i love blur . this album is amazing . i love blur . you are amazing .
0	i purchased this album on amazon.com . i wa very excited when i noticed that it wa available for purchase . i wa hoping to find a song that i loved because it wa a holiday gift . sadly , there were very few song that i liked . the only song i liked wa the song just a little while which is a very catchy song . the lyric are fun and the music is very nice . the only song that i did not like wa the song i just want to have a good time . i thought the lyric were terrible and the music wa very annoying .
1	this song is very short , but i think it is worth it . i like the fact that the song wa written by someone who is not a professional singer , but is capable of singing well . it also is very short .
0	
1	this album is really great . it is really hard to listen to this album in a car or at a party because it is really hard to hear the lyric .
1	this song is arranged well in this arrangement
1	this wa my first listen to this tribute . i have a great love and passion for frank sinatra . i enjoy all of his music but this frank sinatra tribute wa my favorite . i found the arrangement of the song to be very good . the song had some great instrumentation and wa a great tribute in it own right . i enjoyed hearing frank sinatra sing happy birthday . this tribute wa great .
0	i love tegan and sara . i am a major fan of their music . i am not really a fan of the new single . it is not a good a their older song . i would recommend listening to the old song .
1	this is the first dream theater album i have heard that i can think of . i have a lot of favorite dream theater album , and this is definitely one of them . i love the production and the songwriting style . there is a lot of variety in the tune here . this is one of those album that can work for anyone .
1	i have a good friend who owns this album . he ha never been able to get the cd to play so i wa pleasantly surprised when he told me he had purchased it . it ha been sitting in the corner of the kitchen for year , i had given up on the cd only to find it . now that i have it i have listened to it several time and the cd is in better condition than the cd i had when i first got it . it ha a great sound and the song are all very good .
0	this song make me cry everytime i hear it .
0	it is not a good song , and i have turned it off because of the vulgarity .
1	this soundtrack doe the soundtrack justice . it is easily one of the best soundtrack i have heard .
1	i bought this album on a daily deal and it is good . the song are great and
1	i bought this song because i grew up listening to it and i remembered the name of the singer , but when i went to order it on amazon , i discovered that there is no singer on the track . so i went back and ordered this song , and it wa still under the same name . i do not know how this happened , but it is a shame because i really like this song . i think it is a nice song and if it had a singer it would be even better .
1	i love this song . i love this song . it is the best song i have ever heard .
0	the album wa quite a disappointment . i thought this album wa supposed to be more experimental than anything . a it turn out , it wa just another pop album . the song are all just okay . there are some good song on the album , but none of them could make up for the lack of the originality and experimentation that ha been the trademark of outkast
0	amazing band . i love the song jenny world . this band is awesome . this is a great band .
1	i love this song , it is my favorite .
0	i wa lucky enough to get this album . i love this band . i love their music . they are a great band . i love them . i am so glad i bought this cd .
0	there is not much to say . it is a good album .
1	this album is one of the best of the year and one of the best album of all time . the band is the best of the best of the best of the best . they are one of the most diverse and talented artist of the last half century . i could go on and on about this album but i will just say that it is one of the best album i have ever heard in my lifetime and i have been listening to music my entire life . it is filled with genius lyric and is filled with genius music . this album is a masterpiece and definitely deserves all the plaudit and accolade it ha been receiving . i will be buying this album just to say that it wa a great album and to show you that a great album can be created from such an awful album . in fact , i recommend buying this album just to show that great album can be created from such a bad album .
1	i really enjoyed this one . it is good for the first time .
0	this ha to be a joke . next he will duet with william hung . at least the profit go to charity . still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ear .
1	i love this album ! it wa so good i bought the cd for my wife . the song are wonderful . my favorite song wa love that and the others were great too . i wa pleasantly surprised .
0	i think it is a little bit repetitive , but it doe not sound that bad . i would play this song on a guitar .
0	i like this song . i do not like the artist . it is not a bad song , i just do not understand why it is so popular .
0	this is so bad and ha been stuck in my head for over a month and i get it . the song is very catchy and ha a good melody and lyric but it is just so bad and i cringe .
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape
0	ala this wa not the original recording . nostalgia aint what it used to be .
1	this album wa excellent . i thought it wa a great album .
1	very smooth ! keep the music going brother , do not sellout to the usher , rkelleys r & b of mainstream etc . stay pure .
0	a great song . i like the first 2 verse but the rest is a bit annoying .
1	this cd wa amazing . i love the song amor fati . it is a very good song . i recommend this cd to all my friend .
0	i wa pleased with the cd and the booklet . with all the info i needed , i wa able to get everything i wanted in the cd . however , the booklet is a bit small and i would have preferred the cd to come with a cover . the booklet is not designed to be taken out of the cd case , but rather the booklet is made to be put back in the cd case with the cd , it is not very convenient for the cd to be put away in the cd case .
1	i am a big fan of taylor swift . i love her music . i love that she writes song about her personal life . i have watched her video and listened to her music and she is so cute . i absolutely love her . i listened to her album and she ha a very good voice . i love that she is in a relationship . she is so cute and i really like her . i think taylor swift is a great person and she is very talented . taylor swift is my favorite artist . taylor swift is my new favorite artist . taylor swift is so talented and i really like her . now that i think about it , she seems really sweet to me .
0	i listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical piece .
1	i bought this album on a whim one day . i put it on one day and i immediately started listening to it . i wa expecting to be disappointed but i wasnt . this is one of her best .
0	i have been listening to a lot of dubstep lately , but i did not expect the song to be so dub-ish . i wish there were more song in this album .
0	i bought this album because i heard it wa for sale and it wa a good deal . well , i got a lot of good music on there . some of it wa good , but some of it really wasnt . it wa a waste of money .
1	the bluegrass god are back in the sky !
0	i had seen this song on youtube and it sounded good so i decided to download it . it is a very upbeat , happy song . i like the lyric and it is good to dance to . i would have liked it if it wa longer .
1	i can not believe i did not have this album until now . i remember buying this album and listening to it so much , that i even bought it again . i can not remember the last time i wa so happy to have new music . i wa blown away by this album .
0	this sound like a great cd but i do not know if it is worth the $ 50 price tag . the sound is beautiful , i have heard it performed at the philharmonic , but i would expect a better sound and maybe the cd a a whole would be a little bit better .
1	i like the song closer . i am very happy for coldplay . the song closer is my favorite song . it is my favorite song of all of their song . i can not help it . i just like it so much . i can not believe how much i love this song . i do not know who else would love it so much , but i do . i do . i love it so much . i really like this song . i like the song closer . i am very happy for coldpitch . the song closer is my favorite song . it is my favorite song of all their song . i can not help it . i just like the song so much . i do not know who else would love it so much ,
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .

0	
0	most song on this album are too similar . i only enjoyed 2 song . not the best album i have bought in a while . i do like sinach , and wa quite disappointed with this one .
1	i really liked this album . i really like the song the old blue , i also like the song the long and winding road the song what about love i really enjoyed the album . i would recommend it to anyone . i would also recommend this album to anyone . i would listen to it again and again . it is very good !
1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented . a breath of fresh air !
1	very enjoyable , relaxing , great vocal for a laid back album
1	this is really good .
0	it is a nice song , but i found it boring .
1	this song is good . i like the lyric .
0	this is a great score for the music of a great film . the piano and violin part are very good and the percussion is good . the brass is quite good too . it is a very good score and i would recommend it to anyone who like music .
0	this album is well worth the price .
0	i did not enjoy this album a much a the previous album .
1	it is just ok
1	i saw the dead in 83 and 84 , and i wa hooked . i got to see the legendary performance of the grateful dead . i wa a huge fan from the start .
1	the first time i saw lemmy , i wa just so amazed by his voice ! he is the best singer in rock n roll , and the best guitar player too . i have been listening to lemmy since he wa a boy , and he ha always been my favorite vocalist . i first heard him on the song bad to the bone by iggy pop . i wa only five year old at the time , and i wa blown away by his beautiful voice . i wa also very impressed with the way he played on that song .
1	this song sound really bad . i do not like it .
1	i like this cd , i really do . i have a hard time deciding what to like and what to ignore . i have a couple of thing that i like , but this one i really enjoy .
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
1	what can i say , a massively favorite song . to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon prime streaming , but . it lead mymellowing out playlist . it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial .
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 a a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist and have never heard something that i did not like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music in many different format listen to him again and again a he always make you feel ultimately good even his death song album . his take and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i have listened to this album since i wa a kid . i love the album and the book . my favorite thing about this album is that the guitar playing and singing are by one person . i do not know how a song written by several different people would sound . i like the album that much . i just love the album .
1	i do not even know what to say , i love this cd . you can not just listen to the cd and think it is good , it is that good .
1	i found this album to be very interesting , it is a very different musical experience to most . it is not all about the love story , but it is about the romance . it is a wonderful collection of song . it is a great way to relax .
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
0	this chick is ridiculous , she sound like a britney spear on crack . there is absolutely no talent on this bitch .
1	wow ! these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on

1	this is another one i love and really wish i could hear it live !
1	a great song
0	i love this cd ! i bought it for the cd player in my car . the song are fun , memorable , and i love this cd . it is a great cd - i will definitely buy more .
0	i have just bought this cd , and i love it !
1	it is a good album that i like a lot . i am glad that i found this cd . i have had many m cd , but this one is by far my favorite .
0	this is a fine album that get a bit lost on a cd player . it feature performance by such artist a chico buarque , willie nelson , sam phillips , the band , and bob dylan .
1	good cd , but a bit boring . the song are well done but the album is a bit boring . some of the song were not my cup of tea , but when you listen to them you get to the wow part and then they are over and it is time to move on to the next song . there are no real standout song , but the song are very good and i am happy i got the album .
1	this song by the one and only , elvis costello . this is probably the best show elvis costello ha done in year . i have been a fan since the late 80 when he wa still a member of the clash . he is amazing . this song is probably the best song elvis ha done in year .
0	you have to love a song like this . it is got a great beat , but it also ha a great message .
1	i do not know why i wa never introduced to this band . the song are really catchy and well played , and the drummer is the best of his generation . all the song sound like they could have been written by the beatles and the song are all good , except the last one , the one about the girl who is in love with the drummer who can not sing .
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day . i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music . first off , her voice is absolutely amazing . some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million . most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range . she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album .
0	the sound quality is so bad that it almost ruin the entire album . if you want to listen to manson music you should not buy this album . it is just not worth it . i am going to be buying this album for a friend . she love manson . i wish i would have bought this album for my own personal use .
0	i bought all three of these cd because i thought the song on them were so good . i wa so wrong , the song were all the same and had the same melody and lyric . i have about 30 cd in my collection , but i have never seen a cd that had this much repetition of the same song .
0	this an album of jewel best . i hope they continue to release more jewel cd .
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining ! very depressing ! her voice crack , scrape and she can not quite hit the note . buy bonnie raitt instead .
1	this song is very haunting . i have always been interested in music and i have always wanted to be a musician . however , i have always been afraid of performing in front of people because i am afraid i would make a fool of myself . i love this song and i think it is my favorite song on this cd . i really love this song .
1	i bought this cd in the hope of finding some new music made by a young band . i wa disappointed . the music is nothing special . there were no new song . the band ha been around for awhile and have been playing music for many year . i would rather listen to the older song they have been playing for year .
1	it is a beautiful song and sound like a great version . i wish there wa a more extensive cd of the early pink floyd . i would like to see them performed live and hear them play it live . i think that would be very cool .
1	this album is amazing , i am in love with it , i have gotten several compliment on it , and it my favorite so far . it is the best album that i have ever heard .
1	i have to say that this track is the best song of the year . it take the stress of everyday life and make it feel like an adrenaline rush . i love it . i can not wait to hear the rest of the song in the list !
1	a cd of decent quality cd
0	this is a song that i enjoy listening to when im stressed out .
1	i am a huge fan of the dixie chick . i love their song by myself , but i wa very surprised by the band performance . they blew me away . they sounded a good a i had hoped .
1	*
1	song wa super . the amazon player is a total pain in the neck . i had problem playing the song with my usual mp3 and wmp program and i just do not want to get any more song from amazon until that problem is non-existent .
1	i love this song , and i love the band . i love everything about this song . i do not know why it doe not get more respect . i think it is a great song .
0	it is not terrible . i love the guitar riff on it . i love the intro and the chorus . but the rest of the album is just not good . the drummer is annoying . the vocal are annoying . there are no good song on this album . there are only generic , boring song that are not even close to being a good a dancing in the street or satisfaction .
1	i love this album !
0	i wa really excited to get this , but it disappointed me . it ha a lot of good music on here , but it is out of tune .
1	i am not a fan of this song , but i do like the lyric .
0	these are good song but the sound is poor . they are very compressed , which make them sound like a cd you have to turn up to listen to . but they are good .
0	this cd contains the censored version . when cash say the son of bitch you will hear beeeeep instead . what are we , 10 year old ? the at san quentin original version is uncensored . i am not sure what other version are uncensored , but definitely this one is . when this song is not censored , it is a 5-star song that put a smile on your face .
0	i have purchased this cd and have listened to it through twice . i wa a bit disappointed in the first listen to this album , i am still not sure what i wa expecting because the song are good and the music is good , but i thought there wa more to the album , a i have experienced in other album , but this album , for the amount of song available , i thought there would be more . however , when i listened to the cd , i realized that the cd wa ok. to me , i think this is not one of bob dylan best album , but i like it , although the song are not my favorite .
0	i am not a fan of frank sinatra , but i love this album . there is nothing wrong with it ; it is just a compilation of hit and i do not like them .
1	i love this song ! i am glad to hear that it is also available on a christmas album . i have been wanting to find a christmas album with this song . i still remember the first time i heard this song . i do not know how old i wa but i remember my grandpa asking me if i heard the song carol of the bell . i never really heard it until that night . i wish that song wa still around . this version is even better than the original . i love it ! i love how this song sound . i wish i could have heard this on the radio . i love the guitar solo . i love the voice . the song is really cool . it is a great christmas song . i think it is great that this christmas album includes the song . i hope that next year they include this song on an album . i hope that i can find a live version of this song . i think it would be great . i think it would be great if it wa on a christmas album . i think it would be great if this song wa on a christmas album .
1	i have listened to this cd about half a dozen time and it is still my favorite christmas cd . it ha real good instrument and a great mix of song .
0	this is a song that make me want to smash my headphone .

1	a very fine tribute to the dark side of the moon . the song are really great . i have a problem with the cover of money , but i am glad the artist covered it . i also wish the vocal were better . i would have liked to have seen them cover wish you were here . i also wish they would have done more with the female vocalist . i would have liked to have seen them cover set the control for the heart of the

1	this cd is very good .
0	i know why i like this cd so much . i know why i like this cd so much .
1	this is the new release by the band , and it is good .
0	the only thing i felt wa not right wa the fact that the recording quality wa not great . the song were well played and performed , but the sound quality wa not good , especially when one had two channel turned on . i could not get the two song i wanted to hear to be heard , and had to turn off the two channel to hear the rest of the cd . some of the song were not well played and i wa not happy with the sound quality . i am disappointed that i bought this cd and will not be buying another .
1	this song is so beautiful ! i love it . it is so beautiful !
0	although it not my favorite rihanna song , i definitely have to include this song in my playlist .
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .
1	this is the best song of the year .
0	this is a great album . very creative . the guitar solo alone are worth the listen . i did not expect anything le from the first one . the band ha now moved onto the next level .
0	ty wa an inspiration to me when i wa a teenager . his music made me feel safe . i am grateful for what he ha done and i hope he continues to do what he love .
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
1	i have been looking for the track i will get you & baby it is you for over a year now . finally found it . i bought the cd for the track and i must say that it is worth the price . i can not believe how well it stand up to all my driving test .

1	this album ha a great mix of song , and it ha a lot of great artist . it ha good song that are deep , but it also ha song that are not deep . it is like having two albums-one is deep , and one is not .

0	not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality . why even bother with something low quality ? seriously .
1	this song can be very sad , but it is very good sad or happy .
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it .
1	man i wore this cd out when i wa a kid . and the music is timeless . best compelation i ever had and i got it with a burrito . you do not get any better than that .

1	my favorite song to play during my business meeting . in fact , i wa the only one to play it at the meeting we had with the bos . i wa the only one to play it at the meeting we had with the bos .
0	this song is really good but it doe not deserve to be number one on the list .
0	it pain me to see so many 1 star review coming from dylan own fan base . i have been a fan for over 40 year , and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered . bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now , but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time . this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated , but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place , and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate .
1	b is the most beautiful , delicate , and beautiful album of the 1970s . the best album of the 1970s .
0	volume is low when put in a mall radio .

1	i loved this album ! it is excellent . i think it is a great addition to any music collection . the guitar and drum are very good . i like the keyboard and the guitar . the vocal
1	this album is the worst . it is so bad that i am not even going to listen to it
0	this album ha a very similar sound to outkast . there is a nice energy to the song , but they are just average . the song i am your hoochie coochie is actually an outkast cover and the production is good . i would have liked to hear more of them sing their original song . the album is just another out of the box pop album with no creativity to it .
0	i have been listening to this album for year and i could not be more impressed . i can not believe that this is the only album that ha been released . great playing .
0	this is a good song , and the vocal are very good .

0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer . not much ! he gave it his all when singing with her , but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album . did not sound a though he wa giving it his all ! sorry !
1	this song is a great song .

0	my best album ever .
1	this is a great song , and if you like the original , then you will love this . this song is a very well sung , well written , and the best cover i have ever seen of the song . i think this is a great song and ha one of the best cover in my collection . the background vocal are right on the money . the production is excellent . the lyric are perfect . the end of the song is very sad . i had just bought an album of oldie , and i did not buy this album . i just found this after it wa released . i had always been a fan of jim reef . i am a huge fan of his music . i know his music . i wish more people would support him . i wish more people would buy his album . i think he is one of the greatest singer and one of the greatest guitar player .
0	i love the classic moonglows recording . so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl . oops - i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song . this version ha a strong background track , it is highly produced , it is just off . this is just my taste , but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all . anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these .
1	ive bought many copy of this cd . ive bought this cd the whole day at work . ive only bought this cd once . ive bought this cd at work . ive bought this cd last night . ive bought this cd at the office . ive bought this disc at work . ive bought this cd at the office . ive paid for this cd at work . ive bought this cd the whole day at the office . ive only bought this cd once . it a good cd . ive only bought this cd the whole day at the office . ive bought this cd at work . ive only bought this cd once . it a good cd .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
0	i do not understand this song because i do not understand any of the lyric . it is not a bad song . but , i do not understand it .
0	: i like it . it ha a nice melody and the band played it so well .
1	this cd wa good .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror .
1	this is a nice version .
0	a really good song , but this is just a remake of a song that is already popular . if you like you are gon na miss me this is not for you .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 2 other cd this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this is not a very bad cd . it is not very good , but it is not bad . i am not really sure why they are so bad . it could be that the song are not all that great , or it could be that the band ha changed their sound since their first cd or it could be that they are just not very good musician . i do know that i would consider buying this cd , because it is so darn fun to listen to . the song are catchy and each one is different from the last , which is great . you just have to have a sense of humor , and you will not be disappointed .
0	many people will say that the book is censored . i do not know why . most of this book is censored . the only scene that wa not censored wa the same scene a it is shown in the movie the devil wear prada . the book also ha a sex scene in there that is censored and not shown in the movie . i do not know why it wa censored in the first place .
0	i have always been a fan of lemmy , lemmy is an amazing vocalist , he always doe so many different style of playing , and in my opinion , he is one of the best guitar player of all time . he also ha been a true inspiration to me . i am also a huge fan of motorhead , i have seen lemmy play with other band , and i think lemmy is one of the best guitar player in the world . this album is not the best motorhead album . motorhead have always been a great band , they have been doing great for a long time . but when i think of lemmy on stage , i think of the song i am legion by motorhead , and i just can not believe that i have to say this , but this album is not motorhead .
1	i have heard many band and there is always a few artist that stand out to me . i wanted to give tot a chance . i am happy i did . i am looking forward to hearing more from the band . i give them a 10 + .

1	i just received this a a gift i did not expect to like it a much a i do i like the soundtrack to the movie . i like the movie and the music .
0	i saw this cd at a local record store and i immediately fell in love with it . i think the reason i fell in love with this song so much is because of the lyrics- i have been a fool but i am not alone it is a great song and i hope it is the last kiss song we ever hear .
1	i have heard this cd before but never really listened to it . it is a good cd though . i will definetly buy it when it come out .
0	at the risk of sounding like the guy from the movie beavis and butthead i must say , this album is the worst s * i have ever heard . it is not a good album at all . i would not give it a 1 star rating .
1	this one is a pretty good album . i think it is better than most bluegrass album . it doe have a few bad song , but they are not really bad song . the best part of this album for me is the song . i love the vocal . it is a very good album . it is not a good a some of the other album that have come out in the past , but it is a good album . i would recommend this album to any bluegrass fan .

1	this a very good album to listen to . this is not a very good album to listen to . this is not a very very good album to listen to . this is not a very good album to listen to . this album is very good . this is not a very good album to listen to .
0	an odd , slow-paced tune that is really just another version of this . it is not worth listening to .
1	the moon revisited is a great tribute cd to one of the most classic album of all time . the moon revisited is very well done and the artist who covered the song are all really talented . i do have a few minor criticism about the cd . first of all , i wish they would have included this version of money instead of the version from the album . the version on the floyd cd is better and this version is a little bit corny . the other thing i have issue with is the cover of more light . the floyd version is much better and you can tell that the artist is a floyd fan . i would have loved to have seen a version with a woman vocalist singing lead on it . the other thing is that i would have liked to see her cover love you till tuesday or get back . i think they put too much emphasis on the male vocalist . the song a momentary lapse of reason is a little off key . the artist i enjoyed the most on this cd were the one who sang the song that were already on the cd . i wish that they would have included more of the female vocalist . i liked wish you were here and one more light , and i really like another brick in the wall part ii . i think there wa too much focus placed on the male vocalist . i would have liked to have seen her cover brain damage . i would like to see a cover of set the control for the heart of the sun . that is a great song that i really like . the only other one that i liked wa another brick in the wall part ii . i wish they would have included a cover of the sun hit the sky or another brick in the wall part iii . the great gig in the sky is one of my favorite song of all time . i really enjoyed the artist who sang that song , but i wish she had sung it with more passion . the last thing i have a problem with is the cover of in the flesh . i really do not like the song and it really is a shame that they chose to cover it . i would like to have seen a cover of one of my turn . i really like the great gig in the sky . i would have liked to know a little bit more about the artist who sang it , but i am glad that she did sing it . you can tell that she is a floyd fan by the way that she sings it . i would have liked to see a cover of i am not there . i really liked echo . i really enjoyed the singing of the woman in the album , but i wish they had sung more of the song that were already on the cd . the last thing that i have a problem with is the cover of wish you were here . i think that it is a little bit corny . overall , i really enjoyed the cd , but i wish that there wa a little bit more focus put on the female vocalist other than the one who sang the song already on the cd .

0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing it is not the original .
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever purchased it . thanks
1	the first of the series , how-the-west-was-swung , is a collection of the most popular western song of the 20th century - the most popular being the one by the beatles - played by a western ska band . it ha 11 track and i would say it is a little more of a compilation than a strictly western compilation . if you like ska , you will love this album , otherwise it is a little more of a compilation than a strictly western compilation .
1	it is not that good , but it is not bad either . the lyric are kinda weird , but the music is definitely what make the album .
0	this is a very nice album .
0	i have this album and the song are really good . it is not the best , but it is good . the sound quality is terrible . the song have no structure or flow . they all sound like they were sung by a baby . at least the song have emotion . i do not like music that sound like a baby . i do not like it at all .

1	this album is beautiful . i would recommend it to anyone .
1	the whole album ( cd , mp3 , etc . ) is awesome . spend some jack , get a real bargain , enjoy the sound . ken ooltewah , tennessee
1	this is the most underrated album of the last year . a lot of people are confused about this album , but i personally believe this album really deserves to be heard . i have listened to it about 6 time , and the song are really catchy . it is not a huge album , but it is a lot of good melody in a short period of time . it is a good album to listen to if you need some uplifting music .
0	this is an amazing album . i love jobims style .
0	i think i am going to cry . i can not believe that i have to listen to this . i have listened to it three time . each time i get more mad at myself . i know the song is about depression . i can not believe that you made such a bad song out of such a good song . this song reminds me of a book i read year ago called , how to live with your parent . it is about a guy who can not even live with his parent . at the end of the book , the guy say , i am so not going to live with my parent . to me , this song is about that . sorry , if you were hoping for a good song on this album , you got one instead .
0	this band is awesome . this is a fantastic album . i love the band . this band is awesome .
0	do not buy this . not the actual song and is only a partial 30 sec long .

1	this song is great . i would love to hear a remix of this song .
0	this is a fun , upbeat album . very well done . i really like the song .
0	if you have ever made the mistake of buying this cd , you need to get over it and find something else to listen to . i do not understand why people buy this crap . it is just an excuse to turn people off . it is not even worth listening to it . i would rather listen to the music from the original how the grinch stole christmas .
1	i just bought this cd . i love the song on it .
1	i really enjoy the music on this album . but , i have to say that the production on this album is really rough . it is not a good a it is on previous album , but it is the only album of adam that i have heard . i do not know why it is rough , but it is the only album by adam that i have heard that i did not like .
0	this cd sound like the same amy that you know . some of the song are good , some are not . some of the song are good , some are not . i think it is okay , but not a great album .
1	so , band of horse is a new band to me . suffice to say , it is now a if i have been a fan for year . their song are infectious , a they are deep and meaningful . the instrumentation , vocal , and composition are fantastic . what a song .
0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
0	i would not buy this product again .
0	great version of this tune . this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason . however , it is fuzzy sounding , and doe not quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 second . i will try to get a refund . it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie . the visuals add more than you can know .
0	this is another great jobim album .
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
0	only one song on a cd music wonderful i wa looking for more music . at that price offering cd should be full very disappointing
1	this is a really good song for a praise team and child choir ! the lyric are great .
1	i recently heard that david gilmore is working on a new project , and i wa thrilled to see that he is recording a new cd with his band . i wa surprised to see this disc in the catalog , because i knew he would have a great new cd , but i also knew he would have a good amount of material that he had recorded over the year , that he would want to include in this one . i am glad i listened to this cd , because it is absolutely fantastic !
1	this is sooo good . the guitar are sooo good , the drum are sooo good , the vocal are sooo good , and the lyric are sooo good . there are sooo many good song . this is a really good album .
0	the song are all catchy enough , but the production is not there . there are no real track on the album . there is a song about i am your hoochie coochie that is actually an outkast song . i would like to have seen more of them sing their original song .
1	this is an excellent cover . this version is better than the original one . the original version had string that were off . his version wa way better .
1	the best album of the year . i love this album and i do not have any negative comment . i really do not like the song papi and i do not like the video of the song . i would recommend this album to anyone who like great music . i am glad i bought it and i will buy the album .
0	jewel california love is the best of the year . i can not imagine why anyone would dislike this cd of jewel . it is not jewel best material but it is a solid album .
1	johnny hartman is one of the most talented and gifted singer in the world . i love his music and he ha the ability to make the most beautiful melody .
0	i have downloaded the mp3s from this site , and they are great . i listen to them on my computer , and love the way they echo in my headphone . i also have them on my car stereo , which make them even more enjoyable . i think this site is great . i can recommend this site and the mp3s for anyone who is interested in music .
0	i am not sure when this cd wa released but it certainly is doe not contain the original version . in fact , i am not even sure it is really buck fizz ( it is that bad. ) . if you have never heard anything by them before , do not buy this cd . if you have heard them before , do not buy this cd . ick .
1	the last one wa good , but this one wa better .
0	i love this song . it is so hard for me to describe the feeling it provokes in me .
1	i love the sound of this album . my favorite song are the way i feel and just a smile . i love the fact that these song are very positive and uplifting . i feel like i can really relate to each of the song on this album . they all describe love to some extent . i love it . i love the fact that the lyric are so simple and easy to understand . they are very inspirational and uplifting . i love this album . i love it . i love the sound of it . i love this album . i love this album . i love this album .
1	i have been waiting for this album for quite a few year now . i really like it . i think it is amazing . i recommend it to anyone .
0	this song is a little bit repetitive . i think the guitar part is a little bit better .
0	okay , i bought this for one one song . i am just sick of hearing this song over and over . it is not a great song . i never heard of the artist , and it doe not sound like anything else i have heard . it sound just like every other song on the radio .
1	i wa a little nervous about this album . i am a fan of the band . i am not a fan of music . this album is from back in the 1980s .
0	no need to be so formal , no need to be so rigid . no need to be so formal , no need to be such a stick in the mud .
1	one .
0	i love this song . my daughter ha this cd on repeat all the time . i love the lyric and the cute music . i bought this for my brother . the only thing that would make me want to listen to this again is the chorus . it would be nice if the lyric were included in this cd .
0	i wa actually very surprised that there wa no vocal on this song . i thought it wa a great and catchy song . it just did not come across a a hit . so i rated it 2.5 star . it is a catchy song , but it doe not have a lot of impact with the average listener .
0	what the others say is true . i bought this cd back in the early ninety . i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp . no stereo and one song play faster than it should . i have the original mercury stereo lp ( all track were stereo except one ) . just an fyi , the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version . you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube . search for diane ray stereo .
1	this is an incredible album ! i love all the song on the album , but i love this song the best . i loved the whole album . i wish that many more album came out like this . this is an incredible album . i give it a 9 .
0	the instrumentation is amazing , the vocal are very good but when i first heard the lyric i just thought wtf . this ha got to be a joke . why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song . i wa extremely let down . it still give me hope for the sound of this upcoming album . if the lyric were any better this would be one the most badass song ever .
0	the cd is a very pleasant sound . it is very easy to listen to , and the lyric are very easy to understand .
1	this song could be better , but is still a great song .
1	i have this song on repeat for the next 10 minute . love the lyric , love the melody , love the vocal . i have tried to listen to it for more than 10 minute straight . i love josh groban .
1	you know i am here is my favorite song on this album .
0	this is a really good album . i really like this album . it is a good album .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
1	this is a great collection of christian music . the music is well-produced .
0	this album is alright . it is not bad , but i could have done without it . i think this is the best flower album that i have heard . it is not the best out there , but it is good .
1	these remixes are slammin ! you will dance and laugh outloud . warning ! this stuff is explicit . headphone at work , and in public , are reccommended . jonny mcgovern is genious . the remix of do not fall in love with a homo took his already riotous , totally barry white inspired , slow jam and made it a dance club classic . check it out . you must .
0	what a bunch of crap ! if this were any other song it would be in the top 5 , but this is a garbage song . it is okay for background listening , but not for anything else . i would give you a 1 star for the title .
0	i wa excited to hear this song because it wa one of my favorite song from the black parade . the lyric are great and the song is catchy but the band did a terrible job recording it .
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd . i have always liked dj shadow , and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now ( in 2016 ) . it is typical shadow ambiance and found sound , but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like . a few track attempt a dubstep feel , but it come across a plodding . a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern .
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book .
1	it is a great sounding cd . i wa excited to listen to it .
0	a great song but the last verse is so annoying .
0	the song i am sorry is a very good song and very well sung . it is a very good song . the album is a good one but i do not like the lyric . they are not very good and very annoying . the vocal are okay .
1	this is truly a wonderful album . i am not a fan of electronic music , but this album ha me loving it . the song are beautiful . the music is very simple and beautiful . i love the song nessuno . i have listened to this album a few time and it is truly one of my favorite .
1	this is the best radiohead album yet .
1	the legend is back ! best bluegrass ever ! doyle lawson & quicksilver know how bluegrass must be performed ! this album make fun of more from these group .
1	i am a huge lucinda fan . i am hoping that this will turn my interest about her . i really want to have this cd , because it is an amazing album . i really like it .
1	i can usually tell when i am listening to a band album , but this really did not . i have heard of some band that have a tendency to sound like they are from another time , but this band doe not really seem to have those problem . i like the band a lot , and i like
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is the same five minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is intense enough to be a sleep aid .
1	this is a wonderful , peaceful , healing , and relaxing cd to help fall asleep to . i have listened to it many time since getting my copy . i have tried many other cd , but none have ever quite the same effect . this is one of the best cd i have ever heard .
0	the first thing i noticed about this record wa the sound quality . the sound is pretty clear and the music is overall really good . it is not the worst thing i have heard from this band , but the sound quality wa just ok. i will be buying a few more record of this band , but i am not going to be buying this one .
0	this cd wa a pleasant listen .
0	i really enjoyed this album and i would recommend it to anyone that like rap music . this is a great album and i would recommend it to anyone who like rap music . the beat is very catchy and the song are very well written .
1	a really good cd . i have been using it a a gift for .
1	i have not heard this song in a long time , but i wa amazed when i heard it . the combination of simplicity and complexity is what make it . i agree
1	this is one of my all time favorite song , ever . it wa one of the best song i have ever heard . this song is perfect . it is so good and sad . this song is a keeper . i give this song 5 star .
1	this version is really good . i like it .
0	i like the whole johnny hartman album . i do not like many of her song but this is my favorite .
1	this should be an international anthem for the million who resist the 9 to 5. or the answer to the life long question . where do i fit in ? leave it to los lobos to put this worrisome question to a foot tapping celebration ala zydeco blue . all i can say is bon temp roule !
1	i love it .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a while but i am only reviewing it because i thought you should know what it sound like . i love this cd .
0	this is good but i would like to hear more .
0	i do not think this song will ever be on an air cd again .
1	i like the song one day , i will be home . the song is very happy but it is really sad , but i find this song to be very cheerful .
1	this band ha been on my radar for quite a while . this band is a great one . it is a really good album .
0	i have listened to this song a couple of time now , and i just do not think i can call it anything good . if you can not tell by now , i am a huge dubstep fan .
1	i like the new album by the band . unfortunately it is the same old , same old , but with two new song on it . they are the song in the middle of the album . the song are good , but no where near a good a the two new song . i have listened to the entire album . i can not listen to the first one , but i can listen to the new one . the two new song are the song on the last disc . they are the only song on the last disc that are any good . the song on the rest of the disc are the same old same old . i did not really like the new song . they are a lot better than the old song . i did not like the old song much at all . there is nothing interesting about them . i have listened to the whole album . i can not listen to the first one , but i listen to the new one , and the song on the last disc are just a bad . the two new song are the song on the last disc .
1	this song is quite good and the vocal are great .
0	it is a good book to have around , but it is not the bible . it is a collection of the radio program and i think this book would be better if it wa a book length story .
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five star im not sure if they are real people or work for three door down
1	i am not a huge fan of the bos but i respect him and i like this song . i think i will like this song . i like the song .
0	i have got a cd that i bought from amazon.com , but i have never really listened to the cd , except for the last song in the cd . it is a song i bought in the late 70 with some guy who claimed to be from england . it is called the end and it is a song about the end of the world . i have not tried to listen to it since the cd wa on my mp3 player until i remembered that i had it on amazon.coms cd section . i checked to see if it wa available and found that it wa , but i needed to pay to download it . so i did , but i wa told i would only get the song if i purchased the cd . so i did , and i wa very disappointed when i realized that the song had no copyright symbol on it and i wa unable to download the song . i could only download the song part and nothing else . i feel a if i wasted my money buying it . i feel betrayed by amazon.com and other online retailer . i have to pay for the music that i want to listen to . i do not want to have to go out and buy the cd , and then have to listen to the music without knowing if it is copyrighted .
0	i thought this song wa amazing . i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	i purchased this song and i wa disappointed with the quality and content of it . it wa not what i expected and i am very disappointed . i have purchased other song from them and received wonderful song . i wa very disappointed .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go . i wish i could get a refund , i ended up buying the explicit version instead
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can not say it is typical , but it is soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefer mks version .
1	this is cool . the song ha good lyric , but the music is the best part .
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song . dated late eighty early ninety production ha not dated too well . this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio .
1	i ` m not a big band fan , but i like this song a lot ! i would listen to this song everyday ! the song wa really good !
0	i did not like this album . the song are mostly average . i do not know if i should buy the album or not . i liked the song on the album but i do not know if they are worth buying . the album doe not really stand out . i did not really like this album .
0	fantastic album . i love the band . it is a great album .
0	major disappointment . always been a huge bh fan from way back . the songwriting is trite and uninspired . take no chance musically . dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement he is trying to make with the title track . utterly forgettable album .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
1	i think this is a good album for a young blue musician . the song are easy on the ear . it is just a little slow , but still a decent album . but , the production is not very good . the best one is the guitar and bass sound . but , the production make the music sound very boring . if you are a blue musician , this album is not for you . i think the best blue album is the real thing by james cotton . at least , not this one . i think this is a good album for an older , blue musician . the production is good . the song are easy on the ear . the guitar and bass sound are good . the song are not repetitive . the lyric are easy to understand . however , i think there is too much production on this album . it is like they are trying to compete with other musician . also , the vocal are not very good . i think they are much better than the last two album . i think you should get this album . maybe you should be a blue musician . it is a good album . i think it is worth the purchase . but , i do not think you should not buy this album .
1	i just bought this for my wife . she love to dance .
0	the 2014 remaster is terrible . like so much music remastered these day for mp3 player , it is completely oversaturated , so that the sound is compressed and distorted , and there is almost no dynamic range . the sound file look like a brick . this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl . it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster , but this is not one of them . boo !
1	this album ha a unique sound which i enjoy . the song are very well written and have interesting idea . this cd is for the true bonnie raitt fan .
1	it is a great song . it ha a great chorus . i love that it ha a great chorus ! i love that it ha a great chorus ! this is a great song . it ha a great chorus .
0	i think i am going to go listen to a few more track to make sure i am totally out . this album is the worst album ever . i can not believe i have to say this . i am absolutely disgusted and appalled at the quality of this album . this is the worst s * i have ever heard in my life .
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
1	i wa a bit concerned when i saw that the cd wa being sold for $ 2.99 , but i figured , hey it is only music so why not - it is $ 2.99 . i thought this cd wa a good buy , and when i got it , i played it several time and liked it a lot . i thought it wa a nice little album that might not be worth it , but if i wa in the market for a new album , i would buy this one . i think it is a good album that would make a nice addition to any collection .
0	what is it with this guy ? will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material . this guy for 10 year ha re-released the same old music ! the one time he did not with a $ 70 million budget , invincible only sold 2 million copy in the usa . even though his $ 70 million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa . why doe not everyone go to cnet.com , go to the downloads section & get yourself a free mp3 cd ripper !
0	this one is ok , nothing spectacular , but worth the time to listen to it . i thought this one wa great . some nice music on here . i am not sure why i have not listened to this long enough to really know what a dud this is .
0	this wa interesting in that i had not heard of the band until i went to the store to buy this album . i am glad i bought it , but it wa a mistake . this album is awful ! they did not write any good song and they did not even come up with original lyric .
0	i have a very hard time listening to the album , and i did not like it . when i heard the album wa going to be released i did not think much of it . the album is very boring , and is repetitive . i wa very disappointed with the album , but i still think it is a great song . it is a great song for any occasion .
0	when i listened to this album i felt like i just had a bad experience at a nice restaurant . the food wa good but everything wa so horribly burnt you could have just taken a bite and the whole thing would have come out of your mouth . the taste wa awful . the wait wa also almost unbearable . the song were horrible . the vocal were horrible . it wa horrible . i am not buying another album this year . i am not buying another one next year . i am not going to listen to another album again in 2018. i may never listen to another album again . i am not going to use this a an excuse to get a holiday album next year . i am going to blame the poor service i got at the restaurant . i am going to blame the horrible food . i am going to blame the horrible wait staff .

0	i found this to be a much more emotionally powerful than his first album . i do not think i will ever be able to listen to this song without cry .
1	this is an outstanding compilation of song from the 80 .
1	it is very simple , but very powerful . it is about the love that we have for each other and for our friend and family . it is about being thankful for the love we have and the love we share with others . it is about the unconditional love we have for the people that we love . it is about the love we have for our country and how we should live our life . it is about the love we have for our child and how we have to be good to those we love because it is our responsibility to protect them from harm . i have read that sometimes it is difficult for people to understand what love really is , but i think this song help to explain why we should love others and why we should help others .

1	very interesting artist .
1	this album is the best of their whole career to date . i believe this is their best work . they have improved greatly since their last album and the real thing is a great example of that . i wish there wa more of erykah badu on this album . i am very much looking forward to hearing some more song from this band .
1	this song ha a nice melody , very nice voice and good harmony .

0	this is one of the poorest christmas album i have ever heard . i have never heard anything quite like this album , and i have been listening to secular christmas music for over 30 year . i can not imagine how anyone could find this album to be any good . the album start off with i believe in jesus , but after that , it becomes a very poor collection of song . there is no place like home is not very good , and the whole album is very bland .
0	this album ha very repetitive and boring song . the vocal are great , but the lyric are very annoying .
1	this is what i would call the ultimate version . i have had my eye on this record for some time , i just did not know it wa such a good album . what make the clash so great is that they are great at everything they do . i have always been a big fan of the clash , but i now realize that they are one of the most important band of all time . they are one of the only band that have not only played and recorded everything that they have ever done , but they have even made a compilation cd . they have even toured with everyone from u2 , to the who , to the rolling stone . they are also one of the only band that have the lyric in their concert . this is not to say that all the band in the last 40 year , have had this many song , but it is just one of the reason that i think the clash are the most important band of all time . they have been around for over 30 year , and they have been there for every phase of rock and roll . the clash song are not just about the beat , or the lyric , or the music , but they are about the people . they are about the struggle , the dream , the dream of the younger generation . they are about the hope and dream of the older generation . they are about the music , the style , the style of the people . the clash are not just an amazing band , they are an amazing culture . the clash were the first band to use the word punk correctly . they were the first to use the word revolution correctly . they were the first to use rock n roll correctly . they are the first to use the word gig correctly . they have put together more song , than any other band in history . they have put together an album where every song is great . there is nothing that they do , that they do not do . the clash have been there for every generation of rock and roll , and they have been the most important band in the last 40 year .
1	if i had to rate this song 5/5 star , it would be 5 star . i love this song and the lyric are beautiful . i do not know why this review is negative . it is a great song . i just wish i had not bothered purchasing it . i will buy it again if and when i find the time , but i will wait a little . it is worth listening to .
0	this would be a good christmas song for a childrens album .
0	this song wa released in 1995. i believe it wa in the same year a the wrecking ball video . i have not really liked the new music by rihanna , but this song is a good example of something that i have enjoyed in the past . the song wa a nice dance type of song , and it wa fun to sing along with . i like the fact that the music wa different than what i wa used to . it wa fun .

1	the compilation is quite a good value for it price . it includes song performed by many of the most popular artist of the 80 , including , michael bolton , barry manilow , billy joel and carly simon .
1	this song is a great song . it is fun , upbeat , and ha a great beat to it . my favorite part about this song is the guitar solo . i like the way that the violin intertwines with the guitar . this song is not a good a the last one i had listened to from this album , but it is still a nice song . i like the way this one sound .
0	this cd is full of great music . there are 3 of my favorite song on it , no name face is a great song and spin is a great song . the cd is very well done , and is worth the money . it is not a bad album , but there are a few song that are too slow for my taste . there is a good variety of song on the cd , and i would recommend this a a starting point in your collection of classic music .
1	awesome soundtrack to a great movie . i will be listening to this soundtrack for a long time .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep .
0	a fantastic album , a great way to spend your sunday evening . just wish there wa more like it , but hey , there is still plenty of good music out there .

0	not a relaxing music a i though it would be .
1	the cd is great ! it is a nice sounding version of the original song .
1	i did not grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american church that i grew up in but listening to it now make me wish i heard stuff like this earlier . beautiful lyric and it is all lifting up the name of jesus christ .
0	i have a friend that is a professional musician . he is a very good musician , but when it come to music of any kind of tempo , he is lost . i have to sit and listen to him play a song on the phone , or sing a song with me , and i just can not tell what he is doing and can not figure out how to get it to work for me . i have to sit and listen to him play and sing and i am lost .
0	i know a lot of people enjoy i wa wrong i did too back in the day , but i do not really remember it being a huge hit with most listener . the more i listen to this song the more i think the original is the best . i think you can only really hear the full power of the original if you are familiar with it structure . if you are familiar with the original , this is a great song to listen to .

0	i love the little house book . i have probably read them about a hundred time . i used to read them aloud to my little girl and i wa just so excited to see her response . i have always thought that desrosiers did a good job with the book , but this is just not the album . the lyric are not a good a they could have been . i think that the song are beautiful . the music is not very good . i am not a fan of the little house book . i do not know why . it is just not that great .

0	i have only heard one song on this album and that song is last scene by the b52s .
0	oh , what a waste of time ! that the day track is so bad it can actually be called bad . the only good thing about it is when it is at it absolute most annoying , and then you can only hear the why are you so ugly ! part of the song . for someone who is a fan of jon anderson , this is a real doozy !

0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .
1	the most famous song on this cd is scentless apprentice which i have never heard anywhere else aside from this cd , and i have been listening to this cd for a long time . i enjoy the song , but i have to say , it is not a good a it wa back in the 70 . the music is very nice , but it is not the same a back in the 70 . the song is very nice , but the music is a bit on the thin side . the lyric are great , but the music is very thin . i think this one is a better buy than other cd on the market .
0	i thought this album wa an excellent album , but that it wa a little bit too high , in that it wa not very energetic .
0	i am a very big fan of eric clapton . i own his entire catalog . i have bought this album numerous time , and it make me cringe each and every time . the vocal are poor , the guitar is not much to speak of , the bass is weak and the drums/guitar doe not have any bottom end at all . i have no idea why i even bother listening to this album . i am a big eric clapton fan and this album just get on my nerve and i do not like it . i am sure i am not the only one that think this .

1	i have really enjoyed listening to this soundtrack . the music is amazing , and the song selection is excellent .
1	i wa first introduced to sum 41 when i first heard the story of you and me on mtv . i wa skeptical when i first heard the band , since they were pretty new and i did not know much about them . but i have since learned a lot about them and they are definitely a great band .

1	it is really amazing . i listened to this cd over and over again . the only thing that i do not like is that the song when i fall in love is repeated . but i guess that is part of the charm . when i fall in love is one of my favorite song . i bought this cd a a christmas gift for my wife . i absolutely love this cd . it ha a great feel to it , and the song are all good . i would recommend this cd to my friend . it is a great gift for the music lover .

0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
0	they are a great band , and i wa a bit disappointed in the fact that they did not include more song from the previous album , but i am sure their other album will be better .
0	i love the sound of the guitar that is played on this cd , it ha a very unique sound and it is very hard to describe . i love the song candy by the dap king , it ha an awesome melody . the sound on this cd is fantastic and the musicianship is amazing . the song are all very different and i think that they could be played by a variety of musician . the album is a must have in anyones collection .
1	i have listened to this cd several time and enjoy it . i have always enjoyed the song on this cd . i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of rock and roll , great music and great lyric .
1	i love johnny hartman , the man !
1	i bought this cd and wa so happy i did . it is a lot of christian music . i am a christian and i love christian music . i would have been happy with just one cd but i really needed two .
1	i am not the biggest fan of the song one night in bangkok by sia . i do like the rest of the album and this song just ha no soul to it . i can not really explain what i mean by soul , but in a nutshell , it is an upbeat tempo song about having a good time in bangkok . i love the song and the album , but i just can not get into it . while i am not a huge fan , i know there are few people that would disagree with me . for the record , i have listened to the whole album many time over the year . i just can not get into the song . this is a great album for anyone who love the sound of a good pop song . if you are not a fan , you will not enjoy it either .
1	i just love this song .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep .
0	no , this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since . this or that record . ( usually wheel on a gravel road , which everyone seems to worship ) and i wa really so disappointed because she a ) mumble b ) slur or c ) is not a good a she wa on car wheel . true , i have always liked lucinda . in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor , not always brilliant , but always heartfelt and sincere , providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country , blue and rock .
0	it is a great song , but not the best thing to listen to at the end of the day .
0	natalie got too old to write music that is good . we all need a good rest at some point in life . we have to grow up and stop writing music that is good . she is getting too old to be writing music that is good . she ha to take a break .

0	!
1	i bought my first tegan and sara album on the recommendation of my friend ( who i listened to a lot of their music when she wa alive ) . i knew there would be some song i would like , but i never expected to love them ( especially after i heard their the party over album ) . i wa completely blown away by this album . tegan and sara are one of my favorite band and this is why . i love how they are so different from each other , yet so similar . it make it easy to enjoy their music because each song is unique and ha a great message . i would recommend this album to anyone who like tegan and sara or indie music in general . i also think the new song on this album are a good change-up from the old one . i will definitely buy the other album a soon a they are released .

0	
0	this cd is the best album that they have released . i am glad that i bought it . i love the lyric of some of the song . i can not believe that we have been listening to this album for the past ten year . i can not believe that i wasted my money on this disc . i wish i could give this album a 10 out of 10 , but i can not even give it a 5 because i can not stand the vocal . the worst thing that i can say is that it is a good album . however , it is not worth anything .
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist . andre rieu . i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style . he truly ha feeling in each note he play on his violin . i know you will enjoy his music !
0	a great album from the 80 . it is a very heavy album , this is what i personally like most . the song are very good . the band is great . the album is very good . i love this album .
0	: i have been listening to this album for year .
0	i do not know what to say except awesome . this song is awesome . i love jeremy camp . i love his voice . i love his vocal on this song . this song doe not fit any of the other song on the album but it is very meaningful to u .
0	i do not really care for this album , this guy just need to stop with his rapping and stop talking in that slow voice .
0	okay , this wasnt my first choice , but i am really not a fan of this band . i can not understand what make them special and why anyone would listen to anything they have ever put out .
1	this song is good but not great . i like this song . it is a good song but not a great song . i like this song . it is good but not great . i like this song . it is good but not great .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	this is the best song on this album .
1	i really like the album . i think it ha lot of great song that are very catchy . i also like the fact that it ha a little bit of everything . i think it is one of the best album in a long time .
0	i love listening to music , i love listening to classical music . i like classical music . this album is not so great , it is not so good . i could not understand the sound . i have to listen to song for a long time before i could understand the sound .
1	i really like the album , and the song black hole of space is one of my favorite song .
1	i bought four of these . two for myself , just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates . i have a vast sinatra collection . this is one of the top 5 disc . the others being only the lonely , swinging lover , september of my year and the live at the sands.being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot . being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed . it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find .
1	this band is very underrated . the music is very catchy and the lyric are very catchy and funny . the only thing i would change is that the last song go let u get high & go for no reason . i also hope that they will be more consistent .
1	this wa my first time listening to cajun music . i love the music and the singer , jeff , is great .
1	the first live album i have seen pearl jam perform live .
0	i do not really know what the song is about , or who wrote it , a i do not listen to the radio very often anyway . i think i remember hearing this song on a radio show , but i do not know exactly what it wa .
1	i love this new version . the new version is beautiful . the old version wa so , so , so boring ! but this new version is so , so , so beautiful . thank you !
1	this wa one of my favorite song of the year . the song is a great rock song . the song is so good and the guitar solo is amazing . i would buy this song again .
1	absolutely great ! the song are very well done . the lyric are great , and the music is very good . i can not get enough of this cd .
1	this album is a mix of both the beatles and the motown sound . i have been a fan since the beatles first album came out in the early 70 and i wa fortunate enough to actually see them live in concert . i wa hooked . every cd i have ever owned and listened to ha been a beatles album . this is the first time that i have ever heard a beatles album that sound like motown . i think this album is a great mix of both world .
1	i love the arrangement on this collection . many of my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation . a good collection to have .
0	i bought ti for my son who is a music major . he loved it
0	! one of the best song of the year .
1	i love this tune , it my fav dance tune off all time , this tune should always be remebered and should be loved forever
1	awesome brings back many memory of good time , i am a sucker for the oldie
1	this song is good , but one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	i have listened to this album many time .
0	this album is a masterwork . my favorite album of the year . this album is very nice . the song are all great , the production is very good and the musicianship is very good . the song are long but you do not have to sit through all 70 minute . the only thing you can do is listen to the whole album . after you have listened to the album , you will probably never listen to a grateful dead concert again . this is a very good album .
0	another song from the movie love , actually .
1	they are the best band i have heard all year . the best band i have ever heard in my entire life . the best band i have ever heard . they are a great band . i love this band . they are a great band . this band is great . this band is great .
1	i love this song , it is upbeat and ha something for everyone .
1	this cd ha a good storyline .
1	i am going to buy this disc , i love all the song . i have always been a fan of t.j. & s and i always enjoy listening to their album and their song . i am going to buy the album . this album is great . i have listened to it several time and it is good . i would recommend it to anyone .
1	i am a huge beatles fan and have recently become a huge fan of other british artist like the go-gos and the kink . i am very happy to see this album coming out and i can not wait for my friend to hear it .
0	i do not hate this album . it is just not that good . i can not say i like it a much a their other album .
0	it is a bit boring . i like the old song and wish they would release an album of some new song . i do not know what it is , but i just can not get into this album . it is just not my cup of tea .
1	joell ortizs the g-force is a stellar effort . i love joell . his album are always great . there are some filler track on the album . it is recorded in 6 day . most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotable line . green lantern freestyle is sick !
0	i do not know why anyone would listen to this . it is terrible . i can not stand it !
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day . i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music . first off , her voice is absolutely amazing . some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million . most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range . she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album .
1	the vocal on this album are quite good . some of the song are a little too slow for my taste . however , this is a great album . i do not know why they did not release the album digitally . if they did i would buy it .
0	i have been listening to the shinedown album for a little over half an hour now and i am loving it . i love the way the singing on this album is so different from the singing in the other album . shinedown ha such a unique sound to it that i do not think i have heard anything like it in a band this much ! and i am very surprised that i like it so much . i have to give it 4/5 star . it is definitely a good starting point for the shinedown fan .
1	i wa pleasantly surprised with this album . i have listened to several album from other artist and listened to them on my ipod , but this one wa the best .
0	these are great song but the sound is terrible , they seem to be compressed .
0	? - what the hell is that ! ?
1	this is a good song with a great beat . the lyric are a little repetitive , but it is still a great song .
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
0	i love this cd . this is a great album .
0	the best album i have heard in a long time . i have always liked huey lewis and the news and i think this is the best album yet . i love the energy !
0	i like this song , but i can not find the lyric anywhere . i would like to buy it , but i can not find the lyric anywhere .
0	this song is really good . it is a good song .
0	i like the first verse better than the last . i did not know the song wa supposed to have a chorus until i listened to it . i like the arrangement a lot better on this one and the lyric are a little more creative . it ha a more positive message and it is a little more upbeat . i like it a lot better than the actual song . the second verse is also a bit better than the actual song .
0	if you like adam lambert voice then you will love this album .
1	the album is excellent . the vocal are really good . the lyric are good . the instrumentation is great . i think the only thing that i do not like the most is the instrumentals . there are only 2 instrumentals and they are really boring especially at time .
0	i have listened to this album several time and it quality is good . it just not my cup of tea . i would not recommend this album to anyone . i listened to this album to learn the lyric to the song . the song are very generic and have no emotion . in the end , i would say that this is a waste of time .
1	i love love this song .
0	i really like this album ! it is a really good album ! i love this album !
1	this is a really fun song . it is got a lot of different instrumentation and it is really good just like it sound on the radio . it is a good song .
1	i love the lyric . the best is yet to be is a great song .
1	okay , i bought this for one one song . jesus savior , it s a great song and i love the message behind it . my family just sigh when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it . they know no matter the season that song will be played . haha
0	! what the hell , i think i am going to kill myself , my favorite song on the cd ha been replaced , and the song is not that great either .
1	my daughter love carrie underwood and ha all of her cd .
1	this song is great , it is so good . i love the song that you guy put in this song . the lyric are great . i also really like the way the song are so well arranged . my ear were just blown away by the song .
0	this soundtrack left off the only song i enjoyed from the movie . i guess i should have read the song list
1	this cd is horrible . i am listening to it now and i could not get through the entire cd . i do not know anything about this song . i would not recommend this to anyone .
1	this cd ha made it possible for me to breathe easily for the first time it year . kudos to mr fredricksen for bringing buteykos method to light !
0	this really is a good song . it ha a great beat and is the kind of song that is fun to sing along to .
0	great song , i am a fan of the girl group , but i do not think this girl ha had a solo release yet .
1	i love the band perry , i love their live show . they are so loud . i love the live show , it is the best . i love that band . i love this song , the chorus is awesome and the guitar solo is amazing . the song is one of the best one i have ever heard . i love the acoustic guitar with the vocal and the piano . this song is one of the best song i have ever heard . i love this song .
1	excellent track .
0	i really really like this song . the song is really nice and very well sung . i give it a four star review .
1	great cd . great music . great lyric .
0	this is a nice collection of song . i liked the cd a lot . the album could use more song , but on the other hand the song are great . the only thing that bother me is that they sound a little bit like the same people singing . i do not know if that is the way they were doing it or what . but they sound pretty good in the cd .
1	this album ha it all . the best song are thicker than thief i will do anything for you and most importantly take me or leave me . randy bachmans voice is amazing , and his voice is what made him stand out from most singer at that time .
0	this song wa written by the great composer and arranger richard rodgers for the 1942 film the king and i. the song is a beautiful ballad with a simple verse and chorus , but the refrain is so powerful and unforgettable . the first time i heard this song wa the soundtrack for the 1989 film the body starring nicolas cage in which he played a man who commits suicide . the song is about the suicide of a young girl in the film . it wa a very dark and heavy song which i wa quite shocked to hear on vinyl .
1	very good . like it .
0	the album is my favorite album of all time . the song are great . the band is great .
0	i love this album . it is the best album i have ever heard on vinyl .
1	it is christmas time and i have to say i have heard this song on a few christmas album . it always brings back so many memory of my childhood . it is a great song and i hope to one day find a version of the song sung by a real live singer .
1	i am happy to find out that the album i had wanted a long time ago is finally finished . the music is really good and the vocal are nice . the best thing about this album is the cover . it is the same a on an old record of the same name .
1	i love this song . i actually thought it wa the most original song i would heard . it is a pretty simple song but i really enjoy listening to it .
0	i love this song . i do not know why it is not on the radio more often . i would love to hear more from this artist .
0	i am not sure when this cd wa released but it certainly is doe not contain the original version . in fact , i am not even sure it is really buck fizz ( it is that bad. ) . if you have never heard anything by them before , do not buy this cd . if you have heard them before , do not buy this cd . ick .
0	this album had a good concept but wa a major disappointment .
1	i had a really hard time falling asleep on my own last night . i called my parent at 5 and they put me to sleep with this song .
1	i just got this album in the mail and i can not stop listening to it ! i have always been a big fan of marko skiba . i like his voice and his song . i have been a fan for almost 30 year . i wa very excited to see his name on the album . i wa disappointed when it turned out that he wa in a band named marko skiba , but i can not complain . it is a great album . i am a big fan of all the other member of the band . tom is a great drummer and ryan is a great guitar player . this is a great album . the song have great meaning and the lyric are great . it is a great album . i hope you enjoy this album and i hope you will come to my house and hear me play some song from it .
1	this is one of my favorite album by yolanda adam . the album is very well done . this album ha a lot of great gospel music on it . it is a very good album , but is definitly a 5 star album .
0	just saw this album in store . i wa disappointed with the cover art . i thought it wa a little out of place . i wa very impressed with the sound quality . i think there is a lot of talent here . very good recording . i am a huge beatles fan and will continue to purchase the new beatles release . the sound quality is very important to me . the production is very high quality .
1	this is one of my favorite piece of music ever ( not all of the time ) and i can not go anywhere without listening to this song . this is a great song and the album is filled with great song . i do not think the last song on the album is my favorite . i like all the song but i think the last one can be improved . i like how all the song start and end with the same two chord but it could be done in a different way . the last song sound like it should be a rock out song but it is very slow . i would like it to be a faster song like some of the other song on the album . i do not think this song should be the last song on the album . i think you could do it better , but i think it is a good song . i would like to see it a a rock out song and it could be that way . it is really good in the beginning and the end , but it could be a little faster .
0	i thought this album wa going to be great . i wa pleasantly surprised . this album is exactly what i wanted to hear from the dixie chick . i love the song and i love the band . i love the sound . this album will always hold a spot in my heart and i will always listen to it .
0	only liked one song . let your hair down david make something fun and not boring . we hear the same old traditionals every year .
0	this cd is heavy duty sad . if you are a heroin addict , this cd may cheer you up . i only liked one song on the cd and i am a lucinda fan . this is not a feel-good cd .
0	this is a good album , but i do not like the song the way
0	this cd is great , but so far the cd is much bigger than a typical cd . it is not a bad cd , just a little big , but i think it is a good size for two of my cd . the song are all pretty good , just a little slow . i have this one , but i am considering the other two and will probably buy them . i am glad to see that they are available on cd , since they have been really hard to find on vinyl . i have owned both cd with both album ( although not the two i am looking at now ) and i really like the song on the first one better .
1	this album wa very challenging to listen to . it took me a while to get into this album . i really enjoyed the music and the lyric . i think this album will have a very positive effect on hip hop fan .
0	this cd is not a good value for the price . i have several of their album , but this one is not up to par .
1	i love it , i love it ! i love it !
1	her voice is very sweet , but the lyric are so repetitive that it is difficult to get the point of the song . the music is a bit too loud .
0	! i love it ! it is a masterpiece . i am happy to live in this world with people who are like this .
1	i love this album . i think it will be my new favorite album . i really like it .
1	mix in well with other song in cardio workout . when you get a little winded this will help keep you up .
1	i do not know what to say , except that i wa very pleased to find out about this new cd after spending hour listening to it . i have gotten to the point where i no longer wish to listen to anything else .
0	i went on ringtones for android , listened to i walk the line and bought it . problem is it wasnt a ringtone , but the whole song .
0	this is a very creative piece of music , which i think is great . it ha a very powerful , almost hypnotic effect on the listener . i would describe it a a kind of psychedelic or alternative rock with a hint of jazz and 70 soul . it is a very interesting and challenging piece of work , which i am sure you will enjoy . it is about time that we came out of the closet and told the truth about what we really are . i do not see myself a a member of any of the band mentioned here , but i have enjoyed listening to them and have been inspired by them . i think you will be too . enjoy !
1	this is one of my favorite song . i played this at the 40th anniversary of the us enterprise and it wa a special day . i wa in the audience when the first hand wa presented and i wa waiting for the second hand . when i wa ready to come out of the room , my father said , no , it is the last hand . i did not have a hand . no , it is the last hand . i did not have a hand . no , it is the last hand .
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) .
0	i do not have the download . help guideline not working , the cancel button wa hit immediately but account still charged , please credit my account
0	i really wanted to like this album , but it wa just a mess and i just could not get into any of it .
1	leann rime is one of my favorite artist to begin with . no dislike , loved everything about this song . recommended to anyone who need rapture .

1	my kid like this group . it ha a lot of different song to listen to .
1	this is a great song . i love christian voice . very smooth and the lyric are lovely . when i listen to this song i remember being a boy and my mom singing to me . my mom had a beautiful voice and would sing this song to me . i wa in awe of my mom voice and would always say that i loved her voice . i love this song .
0	i bought this album because i thought it wa interesting . i really like it , but i do not feel anything at all . i am going to listen to it again and listen to it again and listen to it again . it is almost like rob zombie is just putting out this album the same a he did before . i am not sure what this album is , but i like it . i will listen to it again .
0	this song is awful ! it wa funny at first , but after a while , it just came across a annoying . the music is decent , but the song itself is uninteresting . i just do not like this song .
0	not impressed . i tried to like it a lot , but could not muster the interest . too much to do , too long to listen to them all . too hard to sing , and not good at all .

0	this review is only for this version of the album ( the remastered expanded edition ) . the mastering sound overly compressed , and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough . the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track . it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album . people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album .
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this 1981 album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides , jim goodwin , peter muny & robert medici . alone worth the price of the album , this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john gatchell . a live version with a significantly different feel appears on & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/comes-alive/dp/b001ijz188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?

1	i am very surprised at the book
0	this album is not very good at all .
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence . an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it , for exampl , e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder . a complete and utter waste of money and time . this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence , but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman .
0	i do not know what else to say . this is a great holiday album .
0	the tune wa a repeat of past have fun teaching song and too advance for my 4/5 year old . i am able to a adjust most of three other song i have purchased . the other song like water cycle were great

1	this is the best cd i have ever purchased .
0	i love this band and i am always disappointed when they have a song on the radio that i know we do not have . kiss me is a song i have already come to dislike , and it is not because it is cheesy or corny , it is because it is boring . it is not even a good cover of the song , it is just a cover ( with a few added song by the band ) .

0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
0	i love this album by the way . i love the fact that he is a strong christian and that he is so humble and real .
0	this is a great album , except for the lyric .
1	this is what you get when you cross a rocker with a big band and a lot of instrument . this is my favorite album by the early 60 rocker rocker band , and the only reason i am giving it 5 star instead of 4 is because of the fantastic horn section in the middle , and of course the wonderful lead guitar playing of the guy from van morrison . i wish they would have made more album like this .
0	this is an absolutely great rock album . the song on this album are pretty basic , but they are great guitar riff and great vocal .

0	j. walsh said what i thought about this album . huey lewis and the news were a great pop-rock , new wave sounding band , they did more blue in the past , now they are trying their take on soul . this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love . huey please try to do another rock album before retiring , i think you can still do it .

0	downloaded it but it ha the same defect a the 30 year old cd track .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep .
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .

1	a nice , upbeat album that is fairly well produced . a i have stated in the past , i think adam ha a bigger audience now that he ha added the american idol name to his resume , but if he were to lose his momentum with this album , i do not think it would be for lack of talent .

1	the music man wa one of the first album i bought on vinyl when i wa a teenager . i had never heard of barry altschul , and i wa a bit leary of him , but i wa also curious to see what he actually sounded like . it wa like discovering a new planet . the album is a tribute to the music of the 60 . it is truly a beautiful album .

1	like most people , i only buy song i have already heard and liked , so . yeah , i think it is good .
1	natalie wa great on the show . you can hear her singing along to the song on the soundtrack . i think it would have been nice to see her perform it live , but you get what you get . i have to say that the song sounded good live when they sung it on the video . it wa very catchy and i can not wait for a new natalie album . i hope they put out some more music from natalie .
0	i so much wanted to love this album ; dylan a sinatra . he must really believe that he doe not sound bad , but it wa painful to listen to the off key croaking . i love dylan and i have been a fan of frank for a long time . the longing and emotion were somewhat evident , but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much . i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive along the ocean with my window open .
0	this is a very cool song but in one of the few case that i have seen , a pop-punk album is given the same treatment a an r & b or hip-hop album .
0	i bought this record on a daily deal , but i wa not disappointed .
0	this wa a decent tribute to the beatles , but there are a few weak track .
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music . it just suck really bad and ha no love in it .
1	this is a great album that i have been listening to for year .
1	i love her voice . i like the whole johnny hartman album . i always like her song . i like her live concert too .
1	the first song on the album is a very good one ! i like how they start off with a very soft and gentle melody that progressively increase in intensity until it reach it climax .
0	while i love the cd , it would not play on our cd player for some reason . i tried it on my son player and it worked . the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it . maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed ? i do not know . disappointed ! : (
0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that . it get lower star rating because it is censored . the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this . when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [ explicit ] but one that is clean ha nothing like [ censored ] or [ clean ] next to it . jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it .
0	i am the first to admit that i have my own bias when it come to this album . i wa once a member of this band and i have nothing but great thing to say about them . i have heard the album and i agree with many of the point you made . i also agree that i did not like the sound of this album . their sound is pretty much what you would expect from a punk band . i wa never a fan of punk music but i do have some musical taste and can appreciate it . the first song , the fence , is my all time favorite song of theirs and it get a big thumb up from me . the other song are good , but not a good a the fence and criminal . overall this is a pretty good album . i would give it a 5-star rating , if i could be a better critic .
0	this song made me want to puke .
0	i had to get the cd version . it is a really nice song . i do not know if the song wa just too long though .
0	very , very disappointing . i love to have variety , but this album is very boring . very disappointing . i wa looking forward for the music to be different . this album is the same thing a all the other album i have listened to . the only difference is the artist name and song . this is a very disappointing album . i will not be buying anything by this artist again . the only hope i have is that the artist will change his sound , but i am not holding my breath . i will not be buying anything by this artist again . i will not be buying anything by this artist again .
0	this cd contains 6 song and i really like them all . i will give this cd a 5 star rating for content .
0	i am not sure if i am just a sucker for music with a story or if this band ha a story . i am not sure if it is a good story , but it sure sound like a good story . i do not know what it feel like to be in love with the drummer . it is not a happy love song . the guy is good , but he is on the wrong side of thirty . i do not know what it feel like to be in love that way . how doe she know ? the song sound like it could have come from the beatles , but it is not like anything they did . the drummer is good . the song are well written and played . they are a band , but i do not know what it feel like to be in love with the drum kit so it is a little hard to say who this band is . i do not know what it feel like to be in love like this .
0	i bought it because i like the song . i like the band because they are good . i bought it because it wa on the radio . i like the song because it is fun .
1	this is the best album by this band . i own every album by this band and this is the best .
0	this doe a great job of expressing the feeling of a child .

0	i bought this thinking since it her first christmas cd . i wa very disappointed . her range of voice ha changed a lot . she sound nasally and scream a lot in some of the selection . terrible !
1	i bought 3 cd from amazon . they were all perfect . the first cd arrived promptly , the second cd wa received at the door step almost immediately . both cd were in perfect condition . i am positive about the future and will order again .
1	i love mouse this is my favorite album by them .
1	ive listened to all the song a million time . this is one of the best album i have ever heard . ive listened to this over 100 time and i still find myself humming some of the song . the lyric are so sweet . i had to buy the cd . i am telling you , this is a great cd . i love it .
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham hill label , this album is a keeper . very relaxing and peaceful , while not putting you to sleep . i love to work late at night and this music is great for that .

0	this song help me get a good night sleep . it is a great song .
0	i love this song . i really do not know how to get it to play on my phone . i have tried with all the different ringtone option and nothing work .
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play ( i have not heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly ) . and most of these will not get much play 30 year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality song not heard much today .
1	if you love
0	this is one of the worst cd i have ever purchased . i paid 20 dollar for this and it is nothing more than a pile of garbage that i will not ever hear again , even if the band is very popular . this is probably the worst cd i have ever purchased . to the band , i am sorry . i do not know how you can expect people to pay you to play your music !
0	i have to say , i love the title .
0	this song is so annoying ! this song is just so annoying . i can not stand how the chorus is done ! the girl are singing in a very high voice and the guy just sings his part and doe not get any credit for it . i can not stand how the guy shout at the chorus . i can not stand how loud the singer is getting . not only that but the song is very annoying . i am sorry but i am not going to waste my time with this song !
1	this is a pleasant surprise . the best part is the instrumentation , which is very good . the vocal are good , too . the arrangement are fine . this is a very good collection .
0	i wa introduced to the hustler by a friend in 2007. i had never heard of her before . i am a big fan of rihanna and i love when other people listen to the album i love .
1	the cd is great . i have heard this cd before and enjoy it .
0	i love this album . it is one of my favorite .
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can .
0	this album is great she is an amazing artist . i have listened to this album on cd twice now . it is worth the price of the cd .
1	i love listening to this song . the guitar and the vocal are both great , and the guitar solo is perfect . this is my favorite song from this album .
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out . i bought it . and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song ( for a total of 18 ) on this version . i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed . i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out . the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy . the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly .
0	the best thing about this album is that the lyric are written by a guy named grumiaux ( who is of course named after his former band leader ) and the music is by marty who wa once a member of the band kurt cobain . if you are looking for a really original band , look no further than this one .
1	this is a great song . a i said
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) .

0	i received the album and it looked great except for the dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in the record !
0	would not allow me to play the song exception # 184 .
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music , so i ordered the album . the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment . the mastering of this album is terrible . a number of the song on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect . when you hear the song live , the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance . but on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music .
1	i bought this album ( and a lot of other pink floyd album ) for the lyric . and i am pretty sure that there are a lot of people out there who did not know that pink floyd had lyric . i am not sure i can say that the lyric are a good a some of the album . but i do think that if you are a floyd fan , you will enjoy this album .

0	i do not know if i will be able to listen to this song . i have been listening to all the other song on my ipod at the same time and it get on my nerve .
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent .
0	a must own for all music lover . the first two are the best , but this one is so full of good idea and emotion that it is the best . i give it a 3 star rating .
0	this album reminds me of my high school day . i love it because adam lambert sings the song that i love .
1	i wa expecting so much more from this cd . i wa not disappointed . the entire cd is very well done . my favorite song wa my generation by the black crowes . the sound quality and production wa excellent . i have listened to this cd over and over and over again . i think it is a must have for any fan of the black crowes .
0	i have not heard this song , but i would describe it a meh . it wa a song that i heard on the radio , and the lyric i heard were very boring . i did not find it to be very good . the song wa nothing special , and sounded very generic . the only thing that i found to be interesting about the song wa when the rapper had a line like , i want you to know that you are the most beautiful . i do not know , maybe that line wa good , but i just wasnt really too excited about this song .
0	: i really like this album . the only thing i do not like is the music video .
0	hall & oates a interpreted by a 1977 casio wristwatch and a screech owl . this is the best of the first quarter of 2010 ? no star ! ( well , i guess i have to give this crap one star to get outa here . ) why only 1 blue album ?
0	ive got to say it is the best jam i have ever had in my life from the way you play the chord and the way you play the drum the way you play the bass the way you play the guitar .
1	one of the best album of 2008 , paul taylor
0	i loved this album . it wa not my favorite blue album , but i loved it .
0	this is a great album . i really like the song on this album . i like the message .
1	i am only a couple of year into music , but i have been to many concert and i have always enjoyed getting to know the musician . i really like this album and i think it is great . i really enjoy the music and i like the musician .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west , their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney , i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice . only one for kanye wa absolutely awful , and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian . rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney , four five second is absolutely very low for both of them .
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
0	this is an excellent album . i love it . i love wayne . he is a great artist . and he ’ ll be missed .
1	if you have watched the tv show , then you already know how catchy the song are . the only difference between tv and the cd , is probably length . i have not actually verified this , but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer , and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show ? either way , a good time with good music .
1	only ha a 7 song but i love them all he sound just like he did when i fell in love with him on sunday best . it is nice to hear a nice young fresh and new voice singing the word of god they could not have picked a better title for the album it wa well done and i have been waiting for it most of the song he performed on sunday best are on here tracklist 1.god in me- joshua put his youth flava and some gospel hiphop singing the mary mary hit 2 .
1	i like this album . i am not a lucinda fan , but i think this is her best work . it is a great cd .
0	this is a very good album , but it will be very difficult to find in the mainstream u music store . i have not had the chance to listen to this in the last few month , and i did not realize that it wa a cover album until recently . i have listened to this album a a cd and on an ipod . the cd version is much better than the ipod version . the cd version is a very good album . the sound quality of the cd is much better than that of the ipod version . i would not recommend the ipod version , but if you have one , i would recommend buying the cd version . i listen to this cd and the other album on the cd version . the cd version is much better than the ipod version . i listen with my car stereo , while driving , and on the run home from work . the cd version is a very good album . the sound quality on the cd version is much better than that on the ipod . this is the first album that i have ever purchased on the internet . i wa very pleased with the cd . i have also purchased several album on the internet , and have never had a problem with either the cd or the music playing on my ipod . the cd version of this album is an excellent album . i would recommend the cd version to others , but the ipod version is very good , too . i highly recommend this album to others , but be sure to get the cd version . i have not had the chance to listen to this in the past few month , and i did not realize that it wa a cover album when i wrote the review . if you have never heard of this album , and you have an ipod , you should purchase the cd version . the sound quality on the cd version is much better than that on my ipod . i would not recommend the ipod version , but if you have an ipod , i would recommend buying the cd version .

1	i have had this album for a few week and i love it . it make me think of the 90 techno movement and how it wa an era of innovative music . it also make me think of a lot of techno/house music from the same period .
0	this song start with the most classic 80 rock riff ever , followed by a smooth pop melody that will get you to fall in love with yourself . the vocal are very weak , and it get very repetitive after a while , but the melody and the guitar work are great . great song . only wish it wasnt so short .
0	this is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performance ever recorded . the cracking noise make it almost unlistenable , completely unworthy of the quality of gmos fine session . you can hear the crackle in the preview - yes , it is that bad and worse all the way through . i am surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy ; sound like it wa made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment . this recording of the same performance is much cleaner : http : / www .

1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
1	it wa so good that i re-ordered it and have now listened to it three time . this is a great disc and is a must have for every gospel fan . so , once again , if you want to hear the good stuff , do yourself a favor and get this disc . you will love it !
0	this is a great album , i really love it .
0	i never heard this song before , but i thought it wa pretty catchy . i have already bought the cd for my husband because he really like it .
0	this song , is horrible . the sound quality is terrible , and the vocal are just terrible .
0	compared to taylor swift cd , this really suck !
1	i have to say is that rick ross ha been thru the ups and down of ppl coming at him and dissing him well this album back every thing up rick ross is coming off real nice on this album . teflon don the album is more of an chilling laid back more kind of an album . song like free mason is really nice track over all the whole album is a worth of a pick pick up it better the drake album drake ha a good album to a well . maybach music 3 is i real nice track to check out to guy go get this album .
1	i wa very pleased with the purchase . the cd arrived in very good condition . it came with two bonus track . the first , the spirit of the lord , wa recorded and played by the lord himself . it begin with great praise for our savior jesus christ . then it go into the full glory of the lord jesus christ himself . i love the song . i have listened to it repeatedly . i am very impressed with the lyric . i have always tried to be obedient to the lord by doing my part . in the song , you are mine , the verse is written : jesus said , i am the one who give you life on the inside and i am the one who take it out and give it to you on your outside . you are mine . you will be mine forever . that is a very beautiful thought . to get a chance to hear the lord speak in a song like this help me to believe that our lord is so much more than human .
1	i like this song very much . i am a huge fan of h.p . lovecrafts work . i love this song and it lyric . i also like the song the man from the inside . i love the lyric of this song , the sun is the same , but i am the same .
0	this cd is a very good one . the song are all good ( no doubt ) . the only thing i find questionable is the cd cover . i think it is very good , but it is a little too long and the cover is very unprofessional . i would like the cover to be of the same quality a the song on the cd . i also think the cover should be in color .
1	this album is the best i have ever heard .
0	the music is all over the place , a little chaotic but great atmosphere that doe not seem to be able to be bottled up .
1	this is an all time classic ! just amazing ! the album is a must have and you should find it if you can .
1	my 3.5 year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable-channel music station . it is now a frequent player . he here is dozen of song a day , but this one wa a sticky one .
1	this song reminds me of a childrens song , but it is a little different .
1	i like the song . i do not know why . i just did not like it .
0	: i like the song .

1	i am a huge fan of the band and have been since their first album . this album is really great , and i am glad i can buy it at a cheap price . the song are all very well produced , and some are really powerful and very well sung .
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
1	i liked the song on the album . i like this album .
0	prince ha a great voice and is one of the most talented singer that ha ever lived . that is why i really enjoy his music . but , this album is just so boring .
0	i love this song , especially the lyric . i do not like the song a a whole .
1	this band is great . they are one of my favorite band because they are very diverse and they have great song .
0	
1	i have been a fan of junkyard for a long time and this is the best one .
0	the only complaint i have with the album is that it is not a good a the first two . i would recommend this album to anyone who like great music , but not those who like to hear their own voice singing .

0	the music on this cd seems to be a mix of style . the singing is excellent , but the song selection is a bit bland . i think i will stick with the other two beatles album .
1	i love this album . favorite include anthem , run , outlaw , scared , chasing twister , and my whole life long . after it all make me weep with joy . if you have never seen them live , do not miss the chance . anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take , few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live .

1	this cd wa a good buy .
1	i have purchased from amazon several time and they have always delivered on time and in perfect condition .
0	a lot of people have praised this disc - but i am not one of them . this recording is many thing , but the soundtrack it is not ! despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him . this disc ha the song that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score ! despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music .
0	? - this song is awesome

1	i absolutely love this album , i love the sound , i love the music , i love the concept , i love the theme , i love the song , and i love the lyric . this album is the best album of all time , and i do not think it can be topped .
0	let me break this down , in a rather incomplex fashion , for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan . nirvana , while rebellious , offered nothing new , or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era . i understand , and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there , but cobain did not speak to you . in fact , he loathed you , a he did all of his loyal fan . that is the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such a nirvana .
1	another fabulous cd from the seattle based band . i love this album , and i will be buying it again when i have the chance . this is another great tribute to one of the most influential musician of this generation . i will buy this cd again , and also i will buy this cd again because i know it will be re-released .
0	i really love the song ! i know it is not a big hit , but i love it . i could listen to it all day .
1	i really like this album . the music is nice . at first i thought it wa more of a hard bop album because of most of the music , but after listening to it , i realized it ha a lot of jazz influence . i think it is a great album to have on the stereo because of the good sound quality .
0	this is one of the best album of the year . the song are all original and very different . the vocal are all very different and it is not too loud .
0	i love this song . i just heard it on a cd by pink floyd it is a great song and i do not know why i did not like it before .
1	this is a great song that is all .
0	i have bought this album twice and both time i have been impressed . the production is great , the track are great and the lyric are what i wa hoping they would be . i am hoping that they continue to tour , because i want more from them .
0	this song totally suck .
1	i thought this cd wa very good . i have been listening to it for quite a while now . it is a great mix of jazz
1	i did not expect to like anything about this cd . it is not at all what i expected . i can not figure out why i like it . the only thing is that it is not the best . the song are not very good . it is a good cd , but it is not the best . the vocal are not a good a i would expect .
1	
1	i really like this song and i think the vocal are good .
1	great choice , great music . i really enjoy this band and they are great live .
1	a very well put together cd . i like the way the music is presented with all the original take and all the overdubs . i am not sure if i love this cd or i love this cd , but i like this cd .
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .

0	this song is a great one to listen to . i think it is a great song and i can not get into it .
0	this is not a bad song , but i do not care for the lyric . i do not like it .
1	this album is really good . it is a good album .
0	well , i really like this cd . i really liked it .
1	i am the kind of person who like to listen to music while i am driving , and when i am parked for a while at work , i am pretty good at keeping my music library away from my ipod . i do not have a lot of new music on my ipod , but i have a lot of music i have listened to at work that i would like to listen to when i am parked . this is such a great way to do this , a it work so well with the job i have . it is an excellent way to have new music while on a long drive .
0	this is the only cd by zappa that i own , so i have never heard this album . i wa disappointed to read so many negative review from other reviewer . i really enjoyed the album , and i can only assume that others were disapointed with the album . i do think that this is a great album , and it is definitely worth the time and money to purchase it . it ha some excellent song on it , and i personally think that it will be a great addition to any album collection .
1	this wa my first ever listen to this song , i love it ! it reminds me of the old day and reminds me of how far we have come , how far we have to go . and how much we have in common .
0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i have loved most of the classical music i have listened to . i found this album very good .
1	a good song , but i did not like the lyric . even when i put in the lyric i did not like them . it is a nice song .
0	the song is very upbeat . there is nothing bad about it .
1	~ this song is so awk~
0	i am so glad i found this album . i have to say that it is a real departure from their normal sound . this album is a must have in my collection .
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .
1	california love the greatest song of all time why everybody go to cali it is mostly the west coast , a for me florida is almost like california , i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida . especially all part around the sunshine state .
1	i wa a fan of joe augustine for year . then i saw him with the band and fell in love with his music . since then , i have bought every album he ha made . i love his music . i bought this album and i am so glad i did . i feel like i found my favorite band .
1	i just bought this song and i like it . i love the lyric , but the music is horrible . it is very hard to hear .
0	i am an avid fan of the little house book . i wa very surprised to hear that desrosiers had never written her own little house book . she is an amazing writer . i really hope that she doe get the chance to write her own little house book . i think that she should get the chance to make her own little house book . desrosiers ha done a great job with this album . i think that the song are beautiful . the music is very good . i really like the song on this album . the lyric are beautiful . i like that desrosiers used different song than those in the little house book . the music is really good . i am glad that i listened to this album . i really liked it . i think that desrosiers should get the chance to write and make her own little house book .
1	this album wa great . i love these guy .
0	i love the original version of rock me which is on the cd i am reviewing . i wish bonnie would have released the cd i am reviewing earlier . this cd would have been on it is way . i am sure bonnie would have enjoyed this cd .
1	this band is a good band . they are still a great band and one of my favorite . they really do not do anything like they did in the late 70 . it is an improvement over their previous album . they have not changed much . i have liked this album . it is still good . i will buy it .
0	i bought the book the book of mormon through my amazon associate account . it showed up on my wish list , but did not show up when i clicked see other item . i reported this to amazon , and they told me that i could have purchased the book , but that my wish list had been used . i have reported this to amazon .
1	i can not say enough good thing about their music . i love the way this song make me feel . i love the way the song sound . it is a little bit fast , but i like that . i really like how the song is different from the previous song . the lyric are just a good a the song . the way their music is arranged is great , and the band play a great live band .
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
1	love the music of this group ! they are great live . i have heard of them for a long time but never saw one of their show . now i have seen one and i can not get over how great it wa .
1	
1	i can not recall when i discovered this band , but i can recall the time i first heard them . i remember listening to them the drugstore and crown of thorn . i had never heard any other band that sounded like these guy . i remember my friend asking me if i would like to go to a show and i wa like no , not really , so i asked him if i could go . we went to the show and i can not believe i spent the money i did on their album . i thought it wa a great album at the time and i still think it is a great album . i do not think it would be hard to make a great guitar solo on any of these song .
1	a great album . i am now a great new fan .
1	this song is like a roller coaster . i love how you can go up and down and back and forth . it give you that feeling of being alive . i also love how the riff have that old school feel to them .
0	this album wa just so boring . i could not wait to get rid of it .
1	a good song , but the quality is not up to par . there are some thing that need to be fixed , but overall i did enjoy it .
0	i love the album . it is my favorite album of the year .
1	it is a good album , but it is not a classic . it is quite short and not a epic a some others .
1	the song is very good .
0	this is a song that i have had my niece sing to me . it is a very happy song and i have had her sing to me a number of time . it is not very difficult to play , but you will have had to work hard to learn it .
0	this is just okay , but it ha good acoustic guitar work and a lovely melody . it is a nice song , but i doubt it will be stuck in your head for long .
0	i bought this to support the artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to . many of them are that good .
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
0	this album is by far one of the best album i have ever heard . i like the band and the vocal are good but the guitar playing is not very good .
1	
0	i have read this book on and off since i wa a kid and i still continue to read it . i like that it is a story about a young boy who wa raised at home . i like the way that this story is told . i like the music . i love the book . i wish that i could have gone to the book signing since i live in california .
0	what wa the point of listening to this cd ? it is pretty much just a bunch of song that you can see on the cover , play , and be happy with . the song themselves are fairly good , but there is not much to make you want to get up and dance . some are even repetitive .
1	i like this cd . the lyric are great and the music is good .
0	i could not really listen to this album . it doe not sound like the movie either .
1	this song is such a great song , it will brighten your day and you will be happy .
0	i did not know that this wa a rock album . i thought it wa a power metal album . this is a great record , but i do not think it is a metal album . the guitar and drum are very good , but i do not hear much of a rythmn . i love the album though , it is good to have that one out of the box album in your collection .
0	lame and repetitive . it could have been a really good album .
0	this is a good song . the lyric are all the same , do not get me wrong , but it is not a bad song .
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
1	this song is a very good example of how great a vocalist jason can be . his vocal range is very well done , and he us it to convey a sense of longing and confusion . this song is a good representation of the songwriter journey ; from childhood songwriting and recording , to the rise of a successful solo career . it is a great listen !
1	this song is such a great song . it is so worshipful and touching ! i love this song !
1	this is a great album .
0	i am not a big fan of her music , but i do listen to this song from time to time . i know that it is not very good but i enjoy it .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	it is a song that you can sing along with . i think it is a good song , but i also think it is not my fav .
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
1	one of my son really wanted this song and think it is 5 star for sure !
0	nothing to write about . just okay .
1	i have read some review where many people said that this album did not deliver any new music . in fact many reviewer said this song rose & thorn wa the same a the other song on the album . i would have to disagree . i thought the new stuff wa enjoyable , but the older stuff wa more fun and memorable . i wa actually surprised and happy with the blessing because i thought it wa one of the best song on the album . i have to give it 4/5 star because i thought they had made a real effort .
0	this is one of the most memorable album i have ever heard . it is without a doubt one of the best album i have ever heard .
1	very good album . the only complaint i have is the song sinister urge is a little too short . it is 3:56 long , so it is kind of annoying to have to fast-forward a little bit to get to the next song .
0	ive heard this song on the radio once and it just doesnt sound like it would fit on a radio . i mean where is the song ? and wouldnt they have the song on the radio a couple week ago ? and i am very surprised to find this on here . and why are you just throwing in here ? thats like throwing in a no frill burger for $ 5 at the local drive through .
1	this song wa so awesome ! i love the way that you guy put the different instrument in this song . the lyric are great and the music is great a well . this song make me feel good and the song make me want to cry . the song wa also very meaningful to me , which i like . i like how we can hear the different instrument in this song . the song wa very good .
0	this album is a mixed bag . i like some of the song on the album and i think that they are very catchy . some of the song are better than others . the production is average to okay . the album doe not really stand out from the rest of the album .
0	i wa pleased to hear this wa released by another artist . i love this song , it is a really great tune , and i am happy to have heard it from another artist . i love this song , it is a really great song , and i am pleased to have heard it from another artist . i love this song , and i am glad i heard it from another artist . i love this song , and i love to hear it from another artist . i love this song , and i love that it wa released by another artist . i love this song , and i love that it is released by another artist . i love this song , and i love to hear this song from another artist . i love this song , and i love to be able to hear it from another artist . i love this song , and it is lovely to hear it from another artist . i love to hear this song from another artist . i love this album , i love to hear this song from another artist . i love to hear this song from another artist , i love to hear this song from another artist . i love this compilation , i love to hear this song from another artist . i love soul music , i love this song from another artist . i love to hear this song from other artist . i love to hear this song from other artist , i love to hear this song from other artist . i love this compilation , i love to hear this song , i love to hear this song , i love to hear this song . i love this compilation , i love to hear this song from other artist . i love to listen to this song from other artist . i love to listen to this song , i love to listen to this song from other artist . i love this compilation , i love to hear this song from other artist . i love to hear this song from other artist . i love to listen this song from other artist . i love this compilation , i love to hear this song from other artist .
1	this song wa a great recommendation . it is my favorite song .
0	i think this is the weakest jewel album of all time .
1	most of the song are very good and i enjoyed listening to this album . a couple of the song were a little too fast and not very good , but i enjoyed the rest of the album . my favorite song is blue moon . the second song i like is all i have to do is dream . the vocal are great and i love the song . i also like the song the way we were . the last song i like is the wind cry mary . i like the second blue moon and the last the way we were . i would recommend this album to others .
1	this is not a good song at all , i do not know what is wrong with this song . he ha a voice , but i do not know how to sing along to the song that are this long . i do not know what he should have done , but he should have sung the chorus . he should have sung the chorus , but he did not sing
1	i do not know a lot about volbeat , but after listening to this album i know that i will be buying this band album in the future . there is a lot of great song on this album . the band play a lot of song from the 1980s , but they also play a lot of song from the 1990s and 2000s . this album is the best they have ever made .
1	she really try to get into the song , and she actually sings the line . this is the perfect
0	the only thing i can say is that it ha great production and the song are very well done , but i guess the best way to put it is that the whole thing is just the same song , over and over , with a different singer , so you can not really get any real rhythm going on . i do not know why so many people seem to love it though , i do not really get it .
1	this song ha a very good message . the message wa uplifting and the singing wa excellent .
1	i think this is a great album . there is not one song i dislike on this cd . i defiantly recommend buying this album .
1	i have listened to this cd more than any other cd .

0	i have been listening to this album for many year . it will take you about an hour to listen to it . it is very good but it is not a good a it used to be . i also think that the mixing of the song is very poor . the song have become very monotonous . there are some good thing here and some bad thing here . i feel like i am being scammed out of $ 10.00 . the only good thing i can say about this album is that it is very good for the price . a cd of this quality is worth at least 5 time the price .
1	i think the movie ha the best soundtrack . everyone else i know is either not that big of a fan or just doe not care about the movie . i am not . i have seen every movie out there and i really like the movie . it is a good movie . the soundtrack is pretty good . it is good . i like the soundtrack . i do not like the movie but i really like the movie . i am a big fan of the movie and it is soundtrack . we have to give it a good review .
0	this is so beautiful , and so sad . that is what we love .
0	well in short , not good at all , not my chemical romance style , if they felt like getting back to the basic at least go back to decent music like three cheer .
1	this is a great cd . i saw gloria bill in concert in cadiz , ky back in october . i bought their cd and could not stop listening to it . always sometimes is one of my favorite song now . oh yeah , and the sister of the lead singer work at sonic here in cadiz . funny , huh ? mmmmmmm . cheeseburger .
1	i am addicted to this cd .
1	this song is very catchy and ha a very nice melody .
1	i love this song . i have wanted to get this song for a while , but it is quite rare that this kind of song is recorded for a long time . the drum are excellent , the guitar sound is great . i love the vocal , they are very good . the production quality is very nice and the song is very memorable . the song is on the all-time best list . this song is one of my favorite . i would like to have this song , but the recording process seems to be something of a trial and error . the drum are excellent , the guitar sound is great . the vocal are good , but not great . this is a good song , but the recording process of this song seems to be something of an experiment . the drum are excellent , the guitar sound is great . there are some flaw in the recording , but the song is still very good . the vocal are good , but not great . the production of this song is very nice and the song is very memorable . this is a good song , but the recording process of this is something of an experiment . the drum are excellent , the guitar sound wa great . the vocal are good , but not great . the song is well worth the money . this song is an absolute must have . this is a great song , but the recording is an experiment . the drum are excellent , the guitar sound great . the vocal are good , but not great . the album wa released a a double album in 1992 ; the first album wa released in 1991. the song is very good . this is a great song , but the recording process of this song is an experiment . the drum are excellent , the guitar is great . the vocal are good , but not sound great . this is a great song , but the recording process of this seems to be something of an experiment . the drum are excellent , guitar sound great . the vocal are good , but not great .
1	sean rowe is a great singer . i am a big fan . if you do not like that type of music , you do not have to listen to it , but you probably will . these song are good .
0	a vile song from a vile album that glorifies adultery and a family destroyed . leanns action during and after her affair ha cost her many fans-me being one of them .
0	i like this band . i really do . they are one of the few band that can make me go yeah ! and ohhhh ! in the same song .
0	doe a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician ? i thought not , so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend . if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be-all , end-all of the music scene , it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago . this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world . look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music .
0	i don t know . it is so slow . it is just not my kind of music . i do not know .
1	i love this band , and their song are really catchy . while the lyric are sometimes a little out of place , and the music is in some way a little too loud , i really enjoy this band . i am guessing that they are not going to last much longer , though , because they are a little bit too repetitive .
1	so when the man said he did not want to be a nigger , then the nigger said no way . when the man said he did not want to be white , then the white man said no way . when the man said he did not want to be rich , then the rich man said no way . when the man said he did not want to live in the white man country , then the white man said no way . so when the man said he did not want to be a nigger , the nigger said no way . when the man said he did not wan na be a white man , the white man said no way . when the man said he did not wan na be rich , the rich man said no way . when the man said he did not wan na live in the white man country , the white man said no way . so when the man said he didn t wan na be a nigger , the nigger said no way . when the men said they did not want to be rich , the rich man said no way . when the men said they did not want to live in the white man country , the white man said no way .
0	i like the song , but they do not seem to be available in mp3 format by the way .
0	if you are looking for a collection of song or an album , then this is not the right one . if you want a collection of song , then this is the right one . but , if you want an album , then this is not the right one .
0	i do not know what this is , but it is pretty good .
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp3 or cd . i like the mp3 option since many cd ( album ) only contain a couple keepworthy song .
0	i tried to order this song by using the buy music button . it would not play . then i tried the track button . it played , but i could not hear anything . i tried download by mail and it did not work either . i am just not sure what i am missing . it is a good song , but i am not sure what i am missing . i am really happy i bought it though . i am glad i did not give up .
0	this song wa good but the cd only ha 2 track .
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
1	the greatest band no one ha ever heard of ha done it again . how doe a band get better and better after every album is beyond me . happy to call them my favorite band with one of the greatest song writer ever .
0	i bought this song for my husband . because he love me and always tell me to buy new song .
0	he tried something new , but it did not work .
1	this is a great song to start the morning .
1	this is so true . i wa listening to this song in the car the other day and it hit me so hard . i cried like a baby when i listened to it . i have not listened to it in a long time , but i will definitely go back to listen to it again . i love this song .
1	this cd is a great addition to any church musician collection . it is very musical , and the music is very soothing . it is one of the best easter album i have ever heard . the lyric of amazing grace are very inspiring , and the music add a religious atmosphere to the service .
0	i guess that i like this band because of the cover art . it look like a really cool album cover . the lyric seem to be pretty good , but i am not sure that i like the sound of this band . it is pretty much the same story every time i listen to them . i do not recommend this band to anyone .
1	it is nice to have song that are not too cheesy and are a little more upbeat . i do not like this song because it is a little too fast for my taste .
0	this is one of the few pop punk album that isnt really pop punk . this is a rock album , but it is more so a rock album that is written to appeal to a different demographic than the average rock fan .
1	this song rock !
0	i love terrance and his acting is superb . he just can not sing but he can really play the guitar . i paid 13.00 for the cd and there were only 2 song i played a little . i enjoyed the spanish type song . maybe if he wa able to sing more soulful . anyway do not pay the cd , but i love you terrance you are one of my fav actor .
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
1	this song is so great !
0	all 4 side were completely scratched and the record would skip every other note
1	i am not sure i have ever heard a better song on a cd . the lyric are just so beautiful , it is hard not to be moved . i think this song speaks to my soul .
1	i have been listening to this song all my life since i wa a little girl . i never would have thought i would be singing it to my kid in the car , but i have done it on many occasion . the song is fun to sing .
1	a i continue to listen to this album , i am amazed at the amount of material this band ha on this album . the band ha changed , but the band itself is still the same . the track are interesting and thought out , but they are all really good .
1	i remember when this song first came out it wa a hot seller . i am from the 70 , so i listened to a lot of music . i remember buying this album , and the song wa on the cd . i do not think i bought the album , but i do remember being impressed by this song . i am glad i did .
0	still a glorious voice . but the arrangement suck . too lounge-y
0	i love this album . i listen to a lot of different music including the beatles . this is a great album . it ha so much great music in it . i would give it 7 star
1	i feel that this cd will bring back great memory of christmas for a long time to come . this is a very good compilation of very good song . it is an excellent collection of original christmas music . i would recommend this cd .
0	a waste of time . the vocal are annoying . the song are repetitive and dull . the instrument are the worst part .
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
1	i like the song . i think it is a good song . i can not tell what it is .
0	this wa the first album i have ever bought . it wa a little overpriced for what it wa , but i will say i am glad i went out and got it . i am a big fan of the beatles , the beach boy and the car , so i thought this would be a great buy . i wa wrong . this album is a rip-off of the beatles , car , etc . the production is terrible , but the song are great , but when you listen to them , you can tell that the band wa very inexperienced and had no idea what they were doing .
0	i first started listening to lou reed when i wa 10 year old . i am a fan of his music since then , but had never heard this album . after seeing them play crossroad i decided to grab this album ( before i bought it ) a i really like the music and the vibe . i wa fortunate to see the band live during crossroad . they played at the highest level of energy and passion . i would recommend this album to any fan that appreciates great music and lou reed music .
1	this album will keep me entertained for hour after repeated listening .
0	this suck . you guy have to admit this song is not good . it is not even close to being good . this song is not even close to being good . this song is not even close . the song is not even close . the song is not even close . the song is not even close . this song is not even close . this song is not even close .
1	this song had a great melody and great lyric .
1	i am a huge fan of the band . i love the music . i would love to hear more music from them .
0	the album is not only a great album , but it is also one that i would have enjoyed listening to while i wa sick of the same old rock-and-roll song .
1	i do not know what it is about this song . i do not know why it is so moving . i do not like happy music , but i like this one .
1	hey , it is me ! i am the new girl . i wa wondering if you would like to see me or not ! i am new , i am new , i am new ( but i like it ) . i like all the new stuff on the blog . i have been really busy lately but i will get back soon . i am excited to hear from you .
0	this song is about the death of johnny cash and how he died . the lyric are very sad . it is a very sad song . this is not a very good song . this is not a very good album . this is not a very good song . this is not very good album . this is not very good album . this is not very great album . this is not very good song . i would not recommend this .
1	andy williams singing is still one of the best and best backup singer . this is one of the best album of 2012 .
1	i think this is a great record for the holiday . i know some people have a problem listening to christmas music , but i think this is something you can listen to all year long . i like the first track , christmas at the zoo . it is a really good song . the lyric are nice , and the recording quality is good . i like the way the recording is done . it is not too loud or too quiet . i think it would be a good song for a wedding or a party . i like the acoustic part of the record , and the lyric are nice .
1	this cd is a compilation of the best of the oldie music . it ha some really good music
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe . but this just wasnt up to her usual . it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger , le universal audience . it also felt like she had forced the new song - they did not flow . and the male vocal did not mix with her voice . disappointing .
0	i think that this cd is the first time i have ever heard anything by the beatles and it is a great album . i have heard some song by other band , but i have never listened to anything by them . i do not think i could handle the noise of their music , but i can handle the beatles . i really like this cd and i would highly recommend it .
0	this album is very good . it is a great album and i love it . the song are catchy and fun to sing along to . the beat are good and are well mixed together .
0	i am a huge fan of the band and have had the pleasure of seeing them play many time . this is the best version of the album that i have ever heard . this is the best version of the album that i have ever seen .
0	this album is a must have for dylan fan . i am sure it will make the fan of bob dylan feel a little more like dylan fan now . i love bob dylan and his music . i think this is one of the best rock & roll album of all time .
1	i wa impressed with this album .
0	there is no better way to start off a review of a best of album than to write a negative review , but . this is not a best of at all . this is a worst of album , and it is really awful . i think i am going to go back to my old review of the album where i just wrote good thing .
1	i own this album and i love it for two reason . 1. the vocal are pretty good . 2. for those who like gwar , this album is a must have .
0	i love this album . i want a copy for my collection . overall , i really like the instrumentals . there is some great one . the vocal are good a well . the cd is very generic and i do not really want to buy it .
0	on this cd you will only find side a of the original album skin diver suite , side b is not included . too bad . plus : it is taken from vinyl , not from the mastertape . i guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip .
1	this cd is very good . i would recommend this cd to anyone . this is a very good cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone . i would give a 5 star rating .
0	i saw them live for the first time in 83. it wa one of the greatest show i have ever seen . i would love to see them live again .
1	good song ! i like this song !
1	this song is so beautiful and give so much energy . you will be touched by this song and it will bless your life .
0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
0	this song is good , but it is a pity that the lyric are so terrible . the lyric are very cliche and very generic . i remember when i first heard this song on the radio , i wa like who is this song by ? . then i realized that it wa by kool & the gang , and it wa called you will never walk alone . that is how i first learned the lyric . i am glad that the go-goos did a version of it and i like the goo goo doll version better . this song is good , but the go-goos version is better . the go-goos song is just better . the go-goos song is much better . i still like the go-goos song better , it ha a good beat and they have a good message in it .
0	it is so overproduced that it is no longer jewel at her best .
1	i really love this song but i think it is a little too repetitive . however , it is a very well sung song .
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline , like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice . i wa curious so i checked her out , i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift . i think that a 12 song compilation would be enough , and trust me . it wa enough . the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated , patsy is also quite ugly and can not carry a tune . after you are done burning this album , also burn anything by alison krauss , emmylou harris , loretta lynn and old dolly parton .
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
0	
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	the first time i saw the band they were at a show at the knitting factory in nyc with two guitarist and a bassist and i wa blown away . this band is not a gimmick band , this band is a real band that ha really good song and they really have a great live show . the only problem is that they are kinda expensive to attend a show because they are a huge band with a huge sound . but if you can get them at a show , i highly recommend it .
0	this album is a must-have for any zappa fan . it is a shame that the rest of the world doe not have access to this album . it is got some great song , and i wa surprised at the amount of cover . the most underrated song on this album is big bottom by rufus wainwright . it is a great song , and many people do not know it . punky dance is also a good song .
0	this album is awesome .
1	
0	every time i try to play . it crash my computer . dont buy . i bought to add to a powerpoint presentation and it will not work .
0	i have been a fan of elvis costello since the early 80 , and this album is great .
1	this is a beautiful album . the band is a wonderful live band but this album is a different experience than other rock album you may have purchased .
0	this is a really good song in the game . i find the song catchy and easy to dance to . it is only bad thing is that it doe not have a good enough chorus .
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past 30 year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album . like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy . these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist ( robert lamm , terry kath , and peter cetera ) however , a most fan know , the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty .
0	one of the best song of all time .
0	well in short , not good at all , not my chemical romance style , if they felt like getting back to the basic at least go back to decent music like three cheer .
1	this song make my soul sing . it is truly a great song with a great message . the song make me want to jump up and sing along . it is a great song .
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some place instead of singing . hard to believe that chris cornell wrote it .

0	i think it is a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echo of eternity . this is by far the worst cd i have gotten in a long time , and the first that made me write a review . the singer may be the worst i have ever heard . even my cat cd sound better . i am very bitter about the $ 15 i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music .
1	a very nice arrangement of the song lily of the valley from the lily of the valley album . i like it very much .
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but the cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer work ! i guess you get what you pay for applies here !

1	this is my favorite version . there is good harmony and it is very relaxing .
1	i could not get to sleep with all the different song i have tried . i needed this to help me get to sleep .
1	this is a very nice , simple arrangement of the lily of the valley from the the garden of love album . it is a very good track . it doe not have the grandeur of the garden of love , but it is an adequate track .
0	it ha been over a week since i purchased this album , and i still can not play it . i do not know what to say , except it is a good song .
0	i can not wait for release of this album . it is very well done . i think it is one of the best album of the century .
1	this wa an amazing album . it wa the best music i have heard from a singer of any type . it ha a very distinctive sound . it ha a very soulful and very rich and full of emotion sound . but it is a very clear voice , with no fals

1	a really good cd . i have .
1	i love this song ! i love it so much ! it ha the best lyric . i love it ! this is the best song !
0	i do not really get the hype for this album . it is not really hip-hop or anything like that . it is a blend of hip-hop , funk and r & b , that just sound like everything i like . the only thing that doe not seem to be from the same place that i am hearing it is the name . no matter what you call it , you will still get the same result and that is not always a good thing .
1	this album is one of the best album i have ever heard . it ha a certain kind of magic about it . the song are very well written and the instrumentation is great . the vocal are great . the lyric are all well written . the production is very good . a great album of all time .

1	great song , and the vocal are good .
1	this song is just perfect . it is so relaxing and make me feel happy . i have never had an issue with amazon before and i wa happy to find this song because i wanted to relax and listen while i wa doing something . the song make me feel happy and relaxed .
0	i never purchased it , it piggy backed on another order and claim i wanted it . besides that it awful . whiny voice , cheesy boring and silly . sound like typical office people trying to get in touch with emotion and make amoving song lol .
0	i like this song a lot . it is really good . but , the problem is that the song ha no vocal . that is why i have not rated this song positively .
0	the bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986 , the music wa just a awful a i remembered it . serious hair metal , here . i listened to the whole album through prime music ( thanks , amazon ) and decided that even though this is getting glowing review , stryper just is not for everyone .
0	i have had this song on repeat in my head for year . i got a copy of the cd for my birthday and i listened to it constantly for 2 week , it wa the perfect gift !
1	all time great song by a great country singer . great to play at 50th wedding anniversary .
0	this is an awesome little cd . it is a collection of song with each track having a different theme . my favorite song is all the young dude . the whole album is great . i think the message is just what you would expect .
0	just heard this song and i think it is amazing and he ha such skill on the guitar . i think he ha a gift to make the lyric and music all one and make it very meaningful . i love the lyric he ha created and i love the music he ha created . i am very excited to hear this song because it is so good .
1	alanis morissette ha a beautiful voice . i had to download it and listen to it often . i really love this song !
0	i really like this song . the song is very good , but the performance is not .
1	i love this artist and his music . i have never heard anything like this before . the song just had such a powerful and powerful tune . if i could find this artist and his music anywhere else i would buy it in a second .
1	i wa hoping for a good song on this album . i love this album . i am a big fan of the band . i am not a fan of music in general , but this album is just something different . i think this is the best album they have ever made . i think this album is very positive . i think this album is very positive . i like that it is a good album to show you that you do not have to be a fan to be a fan .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
0	i am really enjoying this album . i love it .
0	this song is good but it is one of the few song the cd ha . the rest of the song are filler . the chorus is catchy but it is the verse and the outro that are a waste of time .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is the first album from this band . i like the song ride on and good for what is left the best , but the rest of the song are good .
1	much better than i had hoped for ; the basic reason i purchased two additional cd of joes . can not go wrong here !
1	i have been following this band for quite a few year now . they are a great group of guy . this song is a beautiful song . i like the singer , jeff . he ha a great voice . he wa great in the song .
1	i have to give this a positive rating . i will be there is a great song . and the guitar solo is one of the best part to this song . i love how the guitar sound in this song . this song is very good .
1	i love love love this album . it is very good and i really like all the song on this album . i love the song on this album .
0	
0	very good , though i do not like the music video .
0	i got this album a a gift and i wasnt expecting much , but it wa nice . it is an 80 rock song , but it is a great song . i really like it . i like that the guitar and drum are a little bit slower than other song in the album . i like that the song ha no chorus . it is a great 80 rock song .

0	this album is just to listen to at first ! it is okay but i would not buy it .
1	this is the only song on the album that i find any sort of meaning or message in . it is just a very happy tune .
1	i am a huge fan of slipknot . i love their music and their message .
0	i like this song a lot . it is got a unique feel . it reminds me of love me tender for some reason . the guitar sound like his big boy guitar . the vocal sound like he ha a lot of range . the harmony sound a bit like the rock and roll hit , baby , do not go but they are not exactly . the album is well produced . it seems to have a lot of energy . i like the guitar solo . it is not the same kind of sound a others . it is unique .
1	i just wanted to say that this cd is awesome . it is so good that i am going to buy the cd on my own . i just wanted to say that this cd is awesome . it is very well put together and in my opinion the best album that don omar ha ever released . if you love old-school hip-hop you need to love this album . it ha a variety of great hip-hop song . i am very happy with my purchase , i gave it five star for the price that i paid . i bought this album for the price that i paid for it . i am very happy with my purchase and i will definitely be purchasing more . i will recommend this cd to everyone that is interested in old-school hip-hop .
1	this is a very soothing piece of music and it work better than sleep . i have tried other lullaby and this one wa the best
0	a good but not great album . a shame it can not get a better rating .
0	i do not understand the cd review here . the tune are all pretty good . they are catchy . the whole cd is good . it is not something i would want to share with anyone i do not know .
0	i like the song . it is a good song . i am surprised this did not get a higher rating . i do not really listen to this kind of music but i enjoyed it .
0	what ha happened to country music ? i call this crock ! let u get back to the steel guitar and the fiddle and the cheatin and drinkin song that have a story .
1	this album is a classic in my opinion . this band is great .
1	this wa the first lullaby song that i fell asleep to . it is really good , but i wish it would come on earlier so that i could actually sleep !
0	i am not a big fan of cher . i like this song , but it is not a great song . i would call it a 2 star review because it is not my favorite .
1	i love the lyric and the music of this song . the song ha a good beat to it . i like the instrumentation of the song and i like how you put the different instrument in this song . the lyric in this song make me cry . i think that this song wa very meaningful to me . i like the way that you can hear the different instrument in this song . the song wa amazing .
1	i love this album , i love the music , i love the singing style , i love the way he sings , i love the way he stand , i love the way he walk . i love the song with the acoustic guitar , i love the song with the electric guitar , i love the song with the drum , i love the song with the bass guitar . i love the song with the string and i love the song with the horn . i love the song with the guitar and the bass and the drum . i love the song with the vocal and the violin . i love the song without the vocal . i love this album !
1	this is a great album . i especially like the song i am your man and the love affair .
0	lyric are a bit corny but the melody and sound are really good .
1	i really like this cd
1	this song is very inspirational and positive .
1	we just got this for christmas and it is a wonderful cd ! my four year old is asking great question about the song .
1	this sound like a great song and it is on the movie . i hope they use it a a single . i really like the movie and the music is great . this is a good and beautiful song .
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect . it is more than that . it is very similar to a world music cd that we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . i do not know what it wa , but it wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few track that have the guitar chord sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling sleep .
0	i love this song but i do not love this album . this album is not for me . i am not a fan of this album . the song are ok , but the lyric are not that clever . i think most people can not really understand what this song is about . i am not a fan of this album .
0	i have been looking for this for a very long time , but i had not found it until the day before christmas . i received this on christmas day , and it made the day one to remember . i love the music and the artwork is great . i will continue to look for the cd to add to my collection .
0	very good quality sound , very good album , excellent production , and the lyric are good . this is not a great album , but it is still worth the price . i do not think you are getting a great sounding album . instead , you get a boring album . the production of this album is much better than the last one . the guitar and bass sound are great . the song writing is good . the lyric are good .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i bought it in the mail . the vocal were clear and they did a good job with all the instrument . i would buy it again .
1	i love this song . anything featuring david byrne is going to be brilliant , never heard of this band/group before .
1	the song is beautiful and the performer is amazing .
0	i am not a huge country fan , but i really liked this song . it reminds me of my father and my mother .
0	hey , this cd is good ! hey , this cd is good ! hey , this really make me happy hey , this really make me happy
1	this song is awesome ! great song .

0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them . oh well .
1	this is amazing ! i love this song . it is so emotional and touching !
0	not really the song . generic . so disappointing in this purchase
1	i ordered a cd and you guy were very efficient . i got it the next day and it wa perfect .
0	i did not like this album at all . i like the music of wayne and i love wayne . but this album wa boring and i do not like the way they turned it into a whole album like some of the other album .
0	i like to pick out 3 song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program . i can not find 1 here . just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal . almost every song is overplayed . talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road . recalculating ! weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd . they can surely play but need some serious direction . will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid .
0	this album really ha a lot to offer . i like the violin , viola , piano , and cello solo . i like the singing . the violin are very beautiful . beautiful and very clear .
0	i just can not believe you would put this into the christmas cd . it is so bad . i hope you can get someone to help you with your christmas cd and i hope you can get someone to help you with your christmas cd . please email me so i can send you my email address . i love your website . i thought this song wa cute . please email me so i can send you my email address . thank you for your help . i hope you can make this into a christmas song . thank you for your help . i love your website . i really hope you can make this into a christmas song . i love your website . i just hope you can get someone to help you with your christmas cd . i just hope you can get someone to help you with your cd . i just hope you can get someone to help you with christmas cd . i just hope you can make a christmas cd . i just hope you can get someone to help you get christmas cd . i just hope you can make a christmas cd .
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off . i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude . but come on people . by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space . to leave track such a take it away/ballroom dancing/tug of war/c moon/vanilla sky/helen wheels/bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable .
1	love this song .
0	this cd is a great listen . i do not think it is worth the price . it is a good band , but this is one of their worst album .
1	i do not have a child , but i love this song . it is a great song . it is cheerful , and easy to sing along to . it is fun to sing . the lyric are simple , and the melody is lovely .
0	i know a lot of people will hate this album but i did not hate it . i listened to it in the order that it wa released and i listened to it in the order that it wa put together . i really really liked it . the music is great and there is great harmony and a great guitar sound . i recommend this album . i am a huge styx fan and i am glad that i wa introduced to them by the clapton 2010 crossroad video .
1	i love this song and i love the message behind it . very inspirational .
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever purchased it . thanks
0	the only thing i liked about this album is the title song ; it is catchy and ha a catchy melody .
0	a big disappointment . purchased based on the high praise it received in a recent aarp magazine publication .
1	i have listened to this cd several time and really like it . it is a nice collection of song and paul taylor sings well . there are a few song i do not like , however . the only one that i can not stand is my way of living . it sound like a cheap knockoff of incomplete by joe south .
0	this song wa originally recorded by the temptation in 1967. it title is a reference to a line in their song stop ! in the name of love . the chorus is about the people waiting in line for the temptation concert and the song lyric are about not waiting in line for a concert .
0	when i gave this album 3 star at one time ? ! after listening to az , then listening to this , a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch , this album is a bad a it get . first off this guy bite off everything in his site ! the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die , just longer . the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot 9 time , and he is a fool on stereroids . he is all over the medium , and is an annoyment on mtv and bet !
0	i am a little disappointed in this album . i think the song are a little short . i do not know if the band is playing better live or the quality of the recording is better , but i thought these song would be longer and more meaningful . i think that this is a great album , and i will be buying it again , but i would not recommend it .
0	lost is right , this disc being the covermount ( not for resale ) disc from classic rock magazine issue 103 , march 2007. it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time , overlooked gem and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan . ummm . well part of that plan ha been achieved . they are certainly curio . curio from the realm of apathy generation . because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track .
1	i did not think this wa a masterpiece . i thought it wa a great album , though . a really great , diverse and enjoyable album of music . i am a huge wayne fan , and i just love this album . i love all of his album , but this is my favorite .
1	this soundtrack is better than the movie , but not by much .
1	this song reminds me of my childhood . i love that the lyric are so touching . it is a great song to wake up to . thanks for sharing .
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill , over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part , not a high point in an illustrious career .
1	the best album of all time . this is a great album . this is a very good one . this song is a good song to hear . this is a great song to listen to . this is a good
1	the first and most important thing to know about this cd is that it is a compilation of his last few recording . this cd is not a complete disc . this cd is basically a compilation of the best song he released over the last few year , and it includes a few great instrumental piece a well .
0	this album is by far the best country album i have ever heard . no matter what you think of johnny cash , you have to admit that he wa a great artist . the song on this album are great , the arrangement are great , the vocal are great , the guitar work is great , the harmony are great , the guitar work is fantastic , the vocal are fantastic , and the production is great . i have listened to this album for year and i still enjoy it . it is one of the most wonderful record i have ever heard . i love the album . it is the best country album i have ever heard .
0	i wa so excited when i heard this album . i had been a dylan fan for 50 year . the song were so good . i put it on my car stereo and drove to work . the next day it wa still playing . i had to get rid of it .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
1	i love this album ! the beat are hot , the lyric are perfect , and the music wa just perfect , too . i love the way he us his voice on this album . the best part of this album is the beat and the lyric . he is one of my favorite artist !
1	this is probably my favorite song on this album , but i wasnt feeling the song for the first 30 minute of it . i wa really hoping the song would be better once i had gotten into it . the guitar solo is also one of my favorite part of the song . this song is very upbeat and the guitar are nice and soft . that being said , i am not sure how i feel about this song after listening to it a few time .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard , and i have heard many . it is easy to listen to and listen to over and over again .
0	honestly . i hate this song . i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it . it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem . i respect them and really like some of their stuff . ace wa a bos ! . but this is just campy .
1	i have listened to this cd several time over the past two week . my first impression wa that it wa a disappointment . the vocal are a bit scratchy , and the sound is a bit muffled , but the song are definitely worth the price .
1	this is the best song that i have ever heard . it is very well produced and it sound like it could be on the radio .
0	this is an absolutely fantastic album .
0	
1	this is the best album i have ever heard . this album is very good .
0	this cd ha some great song and some that are just ok. i think i will just buy the 2 cd set that i have now ( the 2 cd that are in the case ) . the first cd is a good one though . the 2 cd are a great deal , and i am glad i found this cd . the song are all pretty good , although the 1st cd ha just a little too much of a rickety/hiccupy sound to me . it is still pretty good though .
1	although i am not crazy about this song , i give it a positive rating because of the quality of the instrumentation and the overall feel of the song . this song is a little slow and ha a little bit of a slow beat to it . however , it is a good song to listen to on repeat .
1	this is my second listen to this album , and i am very pleased with it . i think it is a good little album . the production is very slick , and the song are well-written . there is some good stuff on here !
0	well if this is the best massive attack album , then i will not be buying any more . nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop imo . this is way overrated ! i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day , yet i listened to and loved portishead , hooverphonic , morcheeba , sneaker pimp becoming x , etc . there are a few good track , but for the most part , it is a mish-mash . maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length .
0	jewel lyric are not so bad . i do not particularly like most of her song , but i do not dislike them either . she definitely us her voice a lot . if you listen to the lyric , you can see she is not an overly emotional person . her music is her personality . the problem with her music is she sings too much . i can not stand that type of music . it get on my nerve .
0	i hate that anyone think this is burl ives . listen to the other song on this album . listen to the classic from the original animated how the grinch stole christmas . the singer name wa thurl ravenscroft .
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles , and today diva , she ha became the most overexposed product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song . but nevertheless , when she wa a part of destiny child , she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart . her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work , and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay-z .
1	very good cd . i have been using it a a gift for my wife .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
0	the song describes a person who is very strong-willed and always ha the right answer . i love this song because it reminds me of my wife . we have had many argument about very small thing but i always end up giving in .
1	fantastic i love it love it love it , della lift the heart & stir the soul . i start my day with this if at all possible , praise god ! it is best to give your day to the lord , this is the way to do it . i reccommended it highly . jojo
1	i am a fan of lucinda , but i think this is not her best work . i really wish i knew more about her . i love her . i want to have her cd .
1	a very good song
1	this is an amazing album , but i really wish the track i listened to
0	the soundtrack is great and it is a good movie . i wish the movie had a better soundtrack .
0	: i wa really excited to buy this , but i wa a little disappointed .
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment !
1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
0	i saw them live a few time and i absolutely love them !
0	: i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape . i wa very disgusted with the sound . my worn cassette copy wa much much better . i would give it a zero for the rating if it were possible . the performance is wonderful and exciting , but badly mangled by a poor transfer . i would not recommend this to anyone .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
0	it is a good song but it is not a spectacular song . this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music . i love gaga , but not this song
0	the lyric are great , but the music is too much for my taste .
1	i wanted more of their debut album and got it . oh , of course it is not just rehash , but it is more of -and improvement on- their excellent sound , voice , beat , lyric . loved it upon first listen .
1	classic . a classic in my opinion . this band is awesome .
1	i did not know what to expect from this album . i wa pleasantly surprised . i do not have any negative comment . i like the cd . i think it is a good album .
0	i like the cover art of this album . the production quality is good . i also like the music on this album . i would recommend this to anyone . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
1	the book is about a man named joe who ha a very poor hearing . he is a very positive person and ha been through a lot and is very self-sufficient . the radio program give advice and support to people who have a lot of problem .
1	this cd is not bad at all . i have listened to it a few time to get over the bad sound but it is not terrible . i think it is a good cd , just the song order is a little off .
1	this is a very good album . i enjoy listening to it . i do not think i have never heard an album like this . it is a true original . it ha an great sound to it . it is a real treat to listen to . i highly recommend this album . i would buy it again if i could . i would buy it again if i could . very enjoyable . i like it . it is very fun . it is very enjoyable .
1	this is the perfect lullaby . it put me to sleep and i do not have to worry about anything .
1	this is so strange to me that i did not even know this song wa on the album . i love the song . this is a great song . it is one of the best song on the album . it is a great song .
0	love this album .
0	if you like the movie you love the soundtrack , i know i did
0	i have yet to receive this album . i have been a fan of the queen for a long time , and the last album she released wa so good , i am hoping for a much better album . i love the song , but the lyric and the production are just not good enough for me . i will be glad if they release this album on cd .
1	this is one great album . i think it is truly an amazing album .
0	the first time i heard this song , i wa completely enamored with it . i downloaded it a while back and have played it a lot ever since . i can not imagine why anyone would put the song of sorrow on their to download list .
0	this is a great album and it show why they are so popular . they sound like the way i remember them .
0	i will be watching you is the worse song ever written . it is an awful song . it is horrible , and it is disgusting . it is a complete waste of time . if you like the animation , you will love the album . if you like the animated version of how the grinch stole christmas , you will hate this piece of crap . i hate it .
0	i really enjoyed this song . i liked the video , but the song is too short and i do not like the word shoosh
0	hi ,
1	a nice blend of christmas music on a holiday album - nice , mellow music , but no carol .
1	i like the music , but would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download .
1	rock on dude , that rockin song rock , love it !
1	this song wa great . i think it is a little different than the other three song on the disc . the overall sound quality is excellent . i would recommend this song to anyone .
1	r kelly by far ha left the r & b wanta be in the dark . r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry . to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing . this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear ( music ) . again , go get it !
1	this song ha so many great part that i can not choose . the lyric , the guitar solo , and the message in the song are all great . i love this song .
1	this song is an oldie but goodie . the first time i played it , i could not make out the word so i put it on the ipod and played it with the volume turned way down . the second time i played it , i wa able to understand the lyric and the instrument made it a musical journey !
0	this is one of the best sum 41 album . i like the production a lot and i enjoy the songwriting style of this album . the vocal are very unique and the lyric are very juvenile , but i still enjoy the music of this album . i think this is one of the best sum 41 album of all time .
0	! one of the best track from this year .
1	this is a great album , great vocal , great song . great sound .
0	i have listened to this cd about 10 time , and i am very happy . i give it a six out of ten . it is a great album and i recommend it to anyone .
1	this song ha some great lyric . i love the way that it is all mixed together . the music ha a great beat and i like how they used different instrument . i like the chorus of this song . the chorus is so great . the song ha so much emotion to it . my favorite part of this song is i wish that i could be you , and all would be right because i know how hard it is to be someone you like . this song is great .
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here , and i wa amazed at the synergy between her and rodney . these duet could not be better . this album is stellar .
1	i like the way that they have done this album . the vocal are awesome . the instrumentation is great .
0	the song is great but i am disappointed i did not like the video for the song i would have liked to see more from the band .
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
0	this is an album i have listened to quite a few time . it is one that i have enjoyed . it is a good album with some great song . it ha a great vocal and it is a good album . she is not a pop singer , but she is a great performer . i have heard very little about her and i have to say i am impressed . she ha a beautiful voice .
1	i wa an early believer in this album and after the first time i heard it i wa hooked . the band wa from oregon . they were very talented and played their instrument with such passion . the album cover is awesome and the album sounded great . i have listened to this album at least 15 time . the song are very unique .
0	i love jewel . this is the only cd i have ever bought that i have not had to listen to a bunch of time . but for some reason , i can not listen to this cd every day . i get a kick out of it when i see it on tv . i have seen this cd on my tv many time . i just do not like the song .
1	ahmad can play anything and he is always one of the best pianist out there . his playing on this album is simply superb .
1	i like the song . it is a really good song . i like the song . i really like the song .
0	
0	one of the best album of 2008 .
1	chris tomlin never disappoints , his worshipful heart is evident in this album . his music touch every generation , my grandchild , my child and i , all find something to like in burning light .
0	this is a great , upbeat song , and i think the key to the success of this song is adam voice . the lyric are very relatable to the listener , but the lyric are also very catchy and easy to sing along with . i also love the backing track , it is so simple , and it make it easy to sing along with .
0	i thought this one wa great , and i would give it a 4 if it had more of the vocal in the singing .
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient .
0	i heard it on the radio today and i fell in love with it . it is a great song !
1	this is a great song . i really love this song . it is very well sung . it is a great song . this song is the best on the album . it is a classic . it is a great song . i love it . it is great . i love it .
1	nice to be able to download an old single song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album .
0	what an amazing cd . i have been listening to it for year after learning of it existence . it really is a wonder . but for me , the only thing is , there are so many cd i have , that it is hard to choose one . i have this on cassette , then the cd , then the dvd . i have the cd on cd , but the one i am listening to now is on a cd-rom . i have the cd on cd , but the one i am listening now is on a cd-rom . i have the cd on cd-r , but the one i am listening to now is on a cd-rw . i have the cd on cd-r , but the one i am listening to now is on a cd-rw . i have the cd , i have the cd-rom , i have the cd-r. i have the cd-rom , i have the cd-rw . i have the cd-ram . and i have the cd-ram . the one i listen to now is on a cd-rw . and on a cd-ram . can you tell i am not very good at this ?
1	i enjoy this cd .
1	i have been a fan of mikeshinoda since i wa in middle school . i love his song . he is so talented and ha a unique voice that just melt my heart . he is the only singer that i know of that can do ballad and then also sing some rap song . i am very happy that i finally got this cd . i have been waiting for it for a long time . this cd is great . i love it !
0	my favorite sum 41 album . i love the production of the album , and i love the vocal . even despite the age of the writing , it still ha something that make it very much like sum 41. i wa bummed when they broke up , because this wa their best album . i hope they still make more .
0	this is the second trooper release i have purchased , i believe . i wa a fan of the previous trooper album , thigh down . if you want to support the artist so you purchase the album at least take a few minute to listen to the sample . i am sure you will want to download some of the track to add to your personal library . many of them are that good .
0	ooh , an electronica pop christmas song ! no , wait . it is another lady gaga song about sex where she turn everything into innuendo . guess what the christmas tree is . yep . at least it wa free and i did not waste any money on it .
0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
1	this wa my first cd i ever bought . it wa actually really fun to listen to ! i think i prefer this to the last song on the album .
1	this song wa not good .
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came out you think a track featuring garry shider , skeet curtis , and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier .
1	the one song that i could listen to over and over again . it make me happy to think of this song being written . it is a song i can listen to a thousand time and still be happy . i love the chorus . it put you in a great mood !
0	it is a great album . i have never heard anything like it before . i love the fact that it is from a new studio and the song have emotion . i am really disappointed , though .
1	this song is so beautiful . i love the video ! i love the lyric ! i love the music ! i love the song !
0	a great album but i would have like to hear more of the song .
1	great song !
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
1	christina really know how to play the guitar . the only thing that i do not like is that she wa not a strong in the original recording . i think it is a good song to listen too if you are a fan of both album and band .
1	passion is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music . i have been a fan of george skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some year back . if you love great relaxing piano music along the line of george winston or jim brickman , you are in for a real treat . i have never been disappointed in this artist offering . listen to the track and find out for yourself , what you have been missing . and then get passion !
0	i thought this song wa very good , but the singer is a little annoying . i do not think you will like this cd .
0	i liked the first couple of song on this album , but after awhile it just get annoying . the music wa good and the lyric were pretty and i thought that they were trying to go for a new direction . it became boring after awhile .
1	i love soundgarden . i love dig , spoonman , i wan na be your dog , black hole sun , all i need , black hole sun , dig
0	i have enjoyed all of the collection you have made . they are all superb . i especially like the lost boy and the best of the best . great music . thank you for all your hard work .
0	another great album . great song , great production . great album . i really like the lyric . you can not beat a good old roll and a song about love .
1	i love these guy . i have a few favorite song from this album though . luxury is nice . funk is an interesting song . it ha a beat that i would like to hear more of on their next release .
0	no ! i am not a dylan fan .
0	i would not buy this album . there is a track missing and the new dubbs in the speaking part are terrible !
0	mary poppins soundtrack wa the best purchase i have made so far . i bought it for my granddaughter birthday because she love mary poppins . she can sing all the song in the soundtrack and i love hearing her
0	sum 41 ha no talent . they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible . if you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre , try new found glory , the ataris , or maybe older blink-182 material . this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason . it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there . do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band .
0	i have this album on cd player and it is extremely enjoyable .
0	i like her song , i like her voice and i like the whole johnny hartman album , but i do not like the video .
1	i love the cd . i love the band . i have been buying their cd for awhile . they have great song and they are great live .
0	i really do not understand why this is so disliked . i like this song . it is not an i hate rihanna song , instead it is a song written by a man who love rihanna and is trying to get her attention . i do not understand why it get so much hate .
0	this song is pretty slow , i think . i do not know why i did not like it . i just did not like it very much .
1	i really like radiohead
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not .
0	no , it did not play on the phone . it is not the same a the tracklisting .
1	here is a frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago . ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his heyday at capitol record . released in january of 1957 the tune spent 19 week on the chart and peaked at # 15. the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo . this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before .
0	i have listened to this song for year , and i have never found a way to use it in my songwriting . a far a i know , it wa never used in any of my song . i wa thinking someone in the industry told me that this wa a great song , but i am hoping i am wrong .
0	this is a great song . i like the lyric . the song wa originally recorded by elvis presley . i also like the werewolf of london .
0	this song is a tribute to gibson mother . i would say that this performance is good . the song is similar to the original , but it is not good . it is just like someone else singing it . i think that this is a tribute , but not the original . it is not even close . if you like this performance , you will love the original . if you like the original , this is only a tribute .
0	i am not a big fan of the music that the band writes and sings . i like some of the song better than the others , but i do not like the music that they write and sing .
0	i did not download this song on the radio but i did download it , and i really liked it so i went crazy and i downloaded it again .
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance . i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it .
1	i have to agree with a lot of people who were saying this album wa amazing . i do not know how it is possible for one of the greatest singer to get beaten down so much . this album wa amazing . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizza day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it wa . it wa recorded in six day . most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were good . so many quotable line . green lantern freestyle is sick ! - joell ortiz - the g-force
1	this song is great ! it ha good chorus .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable .
0	i own the cd . i am a big fan of the hank williams , jr. he ha been on my mind alot . i do enjoy this album . very good song on here .
1	this is the first of two carry me back song , the second being back again , which would end up on the next cd . i am a fan of the back again song but not the carry me back song . i thought the song had more of a rock/pop feel with a slower tempo . but the second song wa just a good , if not better than the first . the second song ha a slower tempo , but ha a great chorus . and it ha a little rock n roll feel in it .
1	i have purchased this album twice before and both time i wa disappointed , but bought it again . it is definitely good .
1	i think this song is better than any of the one that are on this cd by the same name . it is very good .

1	this is a good beatles album , if you like the beatles . i do not understand why people who think they like the beatles say that this is their favorite beatles album . it is a good beatles album , but the beatles never released a best of album . there is no best of the beatles . this is my favorite beatles album . the beatles were never just about music . the beatles were just a band of great musician .
1	this cd is worth it weight in gold . it is not a musical tribute to the oldie music and it doe not attempt to emulate the oldie instrumentals . for the most part it is a cd of new music that is well done and ha a fresh feel . a an example , there is a track entitled do not leave me now by billy joel . this is a very great song . it is not the real song , but it is a great version of the song . and it is not a a tribute to the good oldie , but it is a very good rendition of the song . i bought this cd when it wa released at the same time a the the sound of music cd ( which i bought in another store ) . i bought this cd because i like it and i like billy joel . i would have bought that cd last , but the sound of music wa available . this cd ha some other good new song a well . i also really like the way these song are arranged . i particularly like the track how much can you take ? it is an excellent arrangement of the song . the lyric are easy for a person of any age to understand .
0	i think i will buy this soon . i love the music and i do not care who she really is or what she is famous for . i just want this cd . this album is great .
1	very nice and relaxing version .

1	this is one of the best song on this album . it is very good and i really like the lyric .
1	this is a great album of all his song . i have listened to most of his music and this is the best . he is a great country singer and songwriter . this is a great mix of his first album . i recommend this album for anyone who like country music . this is an awesome and fun album . i can not wait to hear what he doe next .
1	this great song is a must-have . i have never heard this song , so i can not tell you what a great song it is . i think it is one of the best ac/dc song , but it is a big mystery to me why i would buy this . i am guessing that i have never heard this before .
0	
0	the song can be found on youtube here .
1	this is an excellent album , but i do not think it worth the money . the only song i like is like a rolling stone . the rest of the album is very boring and i can never get though it without getting bored . this album is a waste of time .
1	there is nothing better than this song . this song is perfect . this is a great song . this is a great song . this song is perfect . this is a great song and i love it . this is a great song and i love it . this is a great song . this is a great song . this is a great song and i love it . this wa a great song . this wa a great song . this is a great song . i love this song . i love this great song . this is a great song . this song is great . this song is great . this is a great song . this song is great .
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album , i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse . although second album are known to be difficult , i beleived the band to have promise . how wrong wa i. there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face . it all highly irritating , mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless . i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way , but there is no melody on this album worth writing about .
1	this is a very good movie . it ha a lot of humor and well-written dialogue . i especially like the way that the movie character are written . i hope more movie like this come out . in fact , i think more movie like this are needed . good movie need good music .
1	
1	i really like this song .
1	i am a christian and this is a really good song for me to wake up to . i love the message .
1	i have been using amazon prime for a couple week now and i have never used their music service this much , it is so great !
1	i absolutely love this album . i play it constantly . these song are just perfect .
0	okay , i bought this for one one song . i am just so sick of hearing this song over and over . it is not a good song . i never heard of the artist , and it is not really like anything else i have heard . it sound like it wa ripped from a theme song .
1	this is one of my favorite album of all time . it is a great mix of music and it is a great listen .
1	this is the best cd i have heard this year .
1	a good song , but the vocal on the outro are a bit scratchy .
0	i love david gilmore like crazy . i am really excited when i see that he is working on a new project . this cd is a must have for any david gilmore collection .
0	i just bought this cd because i do not have the original to listen to it with . i had a copy of it for year and have not listened to it yet . i think the music is great but i just do not think it is worth the money . i have heard great thing about this album but i just do not think it is worth the money . i am still looking for my original to listen to it with . i think the music is great but i just do not think it is worth the money .
0	once i would downloaded this song , i felt deceived by the sample clip available here . cincotti definitely ha potential , but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range . he sounded rather screechy . the title track wa also somewhat misleading , because it led me to expect a slow , tender seduction song , not a sad one . i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing .
0	
0	i agree with you . i find this to be a very good album , although i do not think it is a great album . i listen to this cd on an ipod . the sound quality on the cd version is much better than my ipod , but not a good a the itunes version at the same quality .
1	one of the best song of the year .
1	johnny hartman , the man ! i love the new johnny hartman album !
0	i wa a little surprised to see that a lot of critic liked this album , but they do not seem to be very good at writing about this album , and not praising it ( a far a i could tell ) .
1	this song is amazing . i have been waiting for the new album to come out and this song is great to listen to . this song is just too cool to not listen to .
1	the theme song to the tv show the unit is a great song . there is not a lot of singing on the album , but the song are just so powerful and this album is made just for the tv show . ( i wa so sad that the show wa canceled . ) i think when you hear this song you just want to cry , so you do and you cry right where you are at .
1	this album is well put together . the music is very good . i think the only thing that would have helped wa to have a little more guitar and organ in the music . i like this album . it is a great album .
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way , but after reading everyones review , i now see it is not me on a buzz . this song is just horrible . it is off-key , the vocalist can not carry a tune in a bucket , and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background ? a frank barone from everybody love raymond used to say , hooooly crap . thank god it is free and i could hit cancel on the download .
1	i am a single person . i am not looking for a relationship . i like to have a good time . i like to have a good time , with friend .
0	prime music is worthless . i am not renewing next year since i can not download prime song for free to my computer . i paid for this , tutorial say you can download song to your pc , but your s * app will not let me . and on top of this , i hate this song .
1	i always enjoy a k-lo record even when i am not in the mood for it . i am with you on this one . i think this is a great song .

0	good cd . i like it . i do not have any negative comment .
1	i know it is only a little something but it is a song that i have been waiting for year for someone to bring back this feeling of peace . i am very glad i finally found it . it is really good . i am looking forward to hearing it again .
0	i love manowar . i have been a fan since 1982. i have seen manowar live probably 12 time , both in the u and in europe . the song , you are no good , is one of manowars best song . i am glad i bought this album . i am not a manowar fan , but i love manowar .
0	i downloaded this song and wa really disappointed with the quality of the download . the song i downloaded wa the same song a the cd i bought . the quality of the download , which wa a 128kbps mp3 , wa far from good . it sound like it wa copied from a cassette tape . i will not be listening to the song for a long time due to the poor quality of the download . i will not buy this song again .
0	this song is good , but not that great . the song is better than the original . i give this song 2 star .
1	remembered this song from year ago and am very glad to have found it again .
1	
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it .
1	this band is a really good group of musician . this song is a really good song , and it is a great song to watch on a disney movie soundtrack .
1	i bought this cd a couple of month ago and i think it is great . the performance is excellent . the song are very good . i would recommend this cd to anyone . i hope that you can find this cd in a store near to you . it is a very good cd .
1	this is so great ! this is a great song ! this is a great song . this is a great song . it is a great song .
0	billy squier is an excellent singer and
0	this is an author named dave enchautegui . i have read the book . it is a good read . i will read it again soon because i love it . i do not know why you would want to buy a book that the author will not write again .
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .
0	this wa a very well-crafted and performed tribute to the greatest country music artist of all time . it will be a great addition to any country music collection .
0	i do not think i like this album . i think it is pretty good , but not a good a some other album . the lead vocal are not a good a they could be . i do not think the lead singer doe a good job . i think the song are overrated , overhyped , overpraised . i think the lead singer is overrated and overhyped . i think the lead singer is overrated and overhyped , and i think the song are overrated , overhyped , overpraise . i think the lead singer is overrated and overhyped and i think the song are overrated , overhyped , over pravo .
0	i am a big fan of the late great al stewart . i always loved his music . i did not know about his death until a few day ago . he left a large impact on me . i think if everyone who listens to this album actually took the time to listen to it they would really enjoy it . it is not a great album but it is a good start . the song flow nicely together . i think they might have been better if they were a little longer . overall it is a good album but a bit short .
1	thank you for putting out this cd !
0	this is one of those album i used to be proud to get . the song were catchy . people liked the band . however , the new album is just a good . the song are good and the production is good . the new album is just a long a the previous one .
0	i do like this album . i think i like this album the most of the rca catalog . i have it on cd and i think i like it better on cd .
0	the only problem i had with this song is that it wa too much like a cell phone . it wa one of the few song that i could not hear until i had downloaded it .
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
0	! one of the best song from 2008 .
1	i think this movie will make you cry and that is not a bad thing .

1	i loved the cd .
0	i have been using this cd to play on my guitar . i really like the way that it sound on guitar . i am glad that i got this cd because i have always been a huge fan of paul stanley . this cd is awesome . i give this cd 5 star .
0	it is easy to listen to and i can not believe it is been more than one year since i first purchased this cd .
0	just a little something for the kid . just a little something for the kid .
0	pay atttention . from a mix tape and doe not have the whole song ( pointless )
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist .
1	wow ! these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on
0	i can not tell you how many time i have bought this album for my wife . it is really a great album . it ha a great musical feel . it ha some very good song .
0	only liked one song . let your hair down david make something fun and not boring . we hear the same old traditionals every year .
1	i first heard this song when i wa about 15 or 16. i went to go take a bath and i went into the bathroom . i heard this song playing in my head . it wa so catchy , i wa obsessed with it . so i decided to buy the cassette . when i went to listen to it , the song wa not on the cassette . i called my dad and i asked him to take my cassette out of the player . he did and i listened to it and it wa exactly how i had imagined it to sound . i wa so excited that i bought the cassette . anyway , this is one of my favorite song . the lyric are wonderful and i really like the chorus . i bought one of their cd and i love listening to it . i am so glad they have a facebook page . i would like to invite you all to join u .
1	i just love zaba ! i can not get enough of this album ! i love this album ! i recommend it to anyone who like zaba ! i am a huge fan !
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?
1	i wa looking for an easy listening song and stumbled upon this one . it is not a very difficult song to learn either ( although the melody is not very interesting a far a song go ) . very pleasant song that is easy to listen to . very nice cover of the old hit do not let the sun go down on me .
0	
1	i just love this cd , and so doe everyone around me !
1	this album is great . it is a good album . this album is a good album
0	this is so bad that it suck .
1	this is the best album of all time . the only problem is , i do not like this album . i do not understand the lyric . the band need to work on their lyric .
0	this album is a very good album , however , it lack the i am in love song and heart of gold song . the song on the cd are great , but the song on the cd are not heart of gold .
0	i have some pretty strong opinion about this cd , but i will let them be known . i like the music , but the singer , bob dylan , is a little off . he sound like he is either playing or singing his own music . i do not know how to describe it . i am a huge fan of his music , but his style and delivery of his song are very different from his album . he is a very good singer , so i like the music , but i do not think it wa his best . the other song sound okay to me , but i do not know if i will ever get around to purchasing this album .
1	if you do not like the first song this is not going to be a big deal , but i do have to say that i really like the first song . i really like the music on this cd . if you are not a fan of this ( or any other ) song then you probably will not enjoy the collection a a whole . overall , this cd is a great deal and i will probably buy it a second time for the same reason . if you want the whole collection to go with this first cd , then definitely buy this cd .
0	it is a sound track for the movie not the movie should be listed a the song from the movie zero dark thirty . but if they did that no one would buy it . frank bole
1	this is a good song in my opinion . i do not know why i do not like this song . it is not a great song . it is not a bad song . it is not a good song . it is just not great . i would call it a 2 star review because it is not a great song .
0	this ha the best chorus on the cd . it ha this kind of slow , mid-paced kind of drum beat and it is really fast and the chorus is the best part of the song . i like the song and i think it is better than the song on the cd in my opinion . it is just really nice .
0	this is not good at all . i actually thought this album wa a bit too bright and energetic , and too much pop rock . some of the song are very good , but i think they are written poorly .
0	i have not listened to the cd of this album ; however , i have listened to other music cd in the chrome series and i have not been disappointed . the same is true for many of the other cd in the chrome series . in conclusion , i would recommend this cd to those who like the chrome series .
1	this album doe not have the same amount of music a the original soundtrack . however , it doe have the same amount of music a one of the best album of the 90 . it is a great song selection to compliment the film .
0	this is one of the most beautiful album of all time .
1	i thought this wa just a cd of old hit , but i wa wrong . amy did it again ! this is the best amy that i have ever heard .
1	i really enjoyed listening to this album .
1	nice album . the best thing about it is the vocal . i think they are the best on the album .
1	i just bought the new album spiral architect for my daughter . i think she will love it . it is a very good album and i think my daughter will like it a well . it ha a lot of good song and a good overall feel . i am really liking the music on the album so far . the cover design and instrumentation are really cool . the vocal are very good and the music is great . i think this album will be a great addition to my daughter music collection . my daughter is a very good singer and will do very well on this album . she like musical and love to play instrument . she will probably like this album too . i think this album is going to be a great addition to my daughter collection .

0	worse song ever , with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates ? get a life .
0	well . the music itself is engaging . i had heard the song on a cruise ship and wanted the music to help learn the dance . sadly , the lyric are nasty , even in the radio version .
0	i wasnt expecting to like this song . i do not like it . it is just a very happy song . i think that the lyric are not very deep and i do not like the arrangement . it is a good song , but i can not really see that it is going to be a good musical . the song is just too upbeat for my taste .
1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every .
1	i like this cd , i like the music .
1	this is a great album . i really enjoyed listening to this album . i thought the song were very well put together . the vocal are good and the song are a little bit too short . the production is very good . the message is good , but the song is slightly too short . i like the song a lot and i really enjoyed listening to the album . i would recommend this album to everyone .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i would recommend this to any of my friend and family who are metal fan , a well a anyone who love music . there are some of my favorite band on this album , which is awesome . but , a lot of them are not my favorite . but , this album is awesome ! it ha great song and it ha some great song . this is a great album to download . it is a must own for any metal fan . i do not know why these musician make their music so bad . i do not get it . i feel like i am missing out on
1	this is one very good album .
0	i hear this song ha the most beautiful , plaintive , feminine voice of all the johnny rodriguez song . yes , i hear this is a very beautiful and feminine voice , and i do not know how i could listen to this song without being moved . i love it mellow sound , but i do feel that johnny rodriguez is a very male artist and this song is not for me . i wa afraid to buy this cd , thinking that it would be some song i would enjoy , but i am glad that i did . the song all thing come is a very soft ballad , but it is done with a very low bass , and i am afraid of that low bass sound . i am not used to listening to low bass sound , but i will say that this song is very soft and gentle . i do not know how i would have enjoyed it if it were not for the low bass . i hope johnny rodriguez can sing that low bass sound without making me feel the low bass sound . i am afraid to say that i will not buy the cd but i will certainly listen to it .
1	this song ha been in my ear for so long that i thought it had been recorded over . it is been a long time since i heard it first .
0	i just do not like this album . this guy ha really lost it . there is no story , it is just a bunch of song with the same music , just changing word . i would suggest that if you really loved this album , that you go see van morrison . go see him in concert . he will probably put a smile on your face .
0	there are not many new thing on here that i have heard before , but it is a decent cd to listen to even if you are not a fan of jewel . i am just glad to see the music being pushed forward , even if it is just in the direction of more dance-y music .
1	i have listened to this album for the last few week , and i am still quite amazed at the amount of quality material that is on this release . this release is definitely worth the purchase .
0	i bought this album thinking it wa going to be a nice , mellow , nice album with nice , mellow , nice song . what i got wa a nasty , nasty , nasty sound . the song are horrible . the vocal are just horrible . i really hope you do not listen to her . i am sure the other album she wa on were much better . i am also sure the other artist she wa on were much better . so , how do i get this album off my shelf ?
1	hey guy ! do not forget to pick up the cd i have chosen the cd for my funeral . i wa going to get a new cd , but my wife wanted to get me a cd of something she did in college . she made a cd of all the song on the cd that i sent her . i am sure she will enjoy it .
0	not a good listening song for the holiday . voice is too rough .
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
0	this is a poor recording of a very obscure song . the lyric are vague , and are not in english . this is one of those cd that sound like a country song , but the lyric are in the language of the country in which it is recorded .
0	i do not know what she is saying . the only reason i assume is because i do know the song silent night . now how do i delete it ?
1	i think the best thing about this album is that it really brings the genre back to life . one of my favorite song wa i can not believe that you love me , and it is one of my new favorite a well .
1	the band is the best live band i have ever heard . they are a huge inspiration to me and i have been listening to them for a long time . this is my favorite album and i have been listening to this tape for a long time . the quality is great !
1	i have to admit , the first time i heard this cd i thought , wow , that is good , but i do not know how to use it . i have since used it a few time and it is always soothing to the soul . very calming for the mind and very soothing for the body . i also like to listen to this often to help me fall asleep .
1	i heard this for the first time a couple of day ago and i wa blown away . never in my life i would have thought it would sound like this . i did not know it could sound like this . it ha such great energy and i am sad i will not be able to have a copy but i am glad i heard it , so i will look forward to hearing it for the next time i am at one of the concert .
0	this cd ha onley one good song on it do not waist your money on it just go to itunes and buy it what a waist of money
1	this is the best album brad ha ever made . i love this album . i could listen to this album all day . i love brad voice and this album is outstanding . he did a great job of

0	she sounded very young and very young at the same time . yes , she sounded very young and very young at the same time . this is a very slow song , and it is not very loud . i wa surprised that she sounded young at the same time . i did not expect that she would sound like she did . this is a very softy song , and she sounded like she wa not there . i find it very annoying that she is singing in the background and is not singing with the rest of the group . i find it very odd that she is not singing with the rest of the group . i find it strange that she is singing in the background and is not singing with the rest . i hope that is not the case . i do not like it when singer sing in the background . i hope that singer will not sing in the background . when singer sing in the background they sound like they are not in the song . i do not like it when singer sing in the background .
1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy ha ever released . every song is fantastic . in this cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that , though it is clearly big bad voodoo daddy , give it a fresh sound . the lyric are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful . in addition , the duet it only took a kiss is gorgeous . i had vision of fred astaire and ginger rogers dancing during it .
1	she is a very good singer .
1	the music and lyric are fantastic , van morrison is one of my favorite singer , and his song are always very good ! i love listening to his music , and wa surprised to find this album on my cd player . i listen to it while i am driving , and it doe not get in the way of the radio . i really enjoy this album !

0	i know lot of folk love this album . i have been a huge boc fan since they started in 72. i can not listen to this album . except for the remake of astronomy , the song are awful . boc always have great song , very melodic , a pleasure to listen to . this is not true on this album . one bad album out of all their album is not a tragedy . they continue to put out good album to this day . i will be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july 20. i guarantee they will not be playing any song from this dog .
0	this is not a bad record . it is not a great record . it is not even a good record . it is so bad that i do not even want to listen to it .
0	this is a great song for a praise team and child choir . i am not the only one who think so . the vocalist is good . i do not like the video though .
0	i am not a big country fan , but i am getting tired of country music.i will buy some cd or something , but this is just not country . i do not think it is country music when the only thing country is the guitar pick . and the guitar pick is so much worse than anything else on the cd , it is awful .
1	an awesome instrumental , that make you want to listen to the whole album !

0	i know i should give this a 10 because it is so good . i love the lyric but the vocal are so bad that i can not even listen to the song . the cover is a joke , i mean they are really good people , i wish they would give their fan more than that . it is the worst album i have ever listened to .
0	this album is a good album , but i do not think it is worth the money . i heard it once , but i do not know if it is worth it . i like the music from the 60 , 70 and 80 .
0	you could not tell this wa a live recording and i wanted a studio version .
0	this song ha a very bad sound quality . the vocal are terrible , and the song is boring .
1	i have always been a fan of the music of radiohead , and since they have been going out on tour , i get to catch them live . i have been very impressed with this band , and it is obvious they have something special going on .
0	jeremy camp is a great new voice . i do not know how he did it but he is amazing . jeremy camp is a great new voice ! i love jeremy camp ! i love his music ! i love jeremy camp ! i love his voice !
0	this is a great version of the song . i like it . i do not like it . i like the version that is on the radio . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . the drum are not needed . i do not know if the guitar sound better with the electric guitar plugged in or without . the drum are not needed . the vocal harmony are great . i like this version a lot . what is missing is the electric guitar . i like the version of the song that is on the radio . the vocal are great . it is a good song . i like it . i like it a lot .
0	i love this song . it is very emotional . it is kind of what i expect from a neil diamond type song . i give this song 5 star .
1	i really like this cd . i have always wanted a copy of an lp of this artist , but wa afraid that i would be disappointed with a cd . this cd ha been a big hit with my family . we have listened to it many time , and it is just a good a the cd is .
0	this is not bad . it is just not good . it is the same old song , but done in a different way . it just is not interesting to me .
0	i heard this song on the radio . i liked it so much that i bought the album . i like this song so much that i bought the album . i like this song so , so much , that i can not really find anything negative to say about it . i like the harmony . it wa recorded by elvis presley . i like the harmony . i like the guitar solo . it is not the same type of sound a others . it is unique . i am sorry to say that this album is a bit repetitive .
1	great song , and i love listening to it .
0	-
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how
0	after listening to this song , i can not believe how catchy it is . i wish it wa more upbeat , but it is still a pretty good song . it is not the most popular song to date but it is a song that can get stuck in your head .
0	i am in love with the band . but there is no one song that hold a candle to this album . there is no one song that is better than this album and i think that this album is the worst album ever in any band .
1	i think this is a great album . i love every song . all of the song on this album are great and i love them all . i think that this album is a great album . this album is worth buying . this album is a great album . i think this album is a great album . i think this album is a great , great album . it is a very good album .
1	this song sound like a mix of the beatles , the everly brother , and a few others .
1	this is a good song . this is my favorite nirvana song .
1	i bought this cd for my wife , she love it , and it ha been a wonderful gift .
0	this is the best of blur album . this is blur in it is purest form . the song are just so good . this is the best blur album .
1	this is a wonderful cd . i love it .
1	the song on this album are worshipful , worshipful and worshipful . the songwriting is on point , and the vocal are flawless . the song are short , but they are well done and all of them are very worshipful . the song are simple and do not overuse the word worship in the title of the song .
0	compared to taylor swift cd , this really suck !
1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
1	i can understand how people are disappointed with this album . it is definitely a bit dated , but there are no real major flaw . the song are really good . i think the most important thing is that it doe what it is supposed to do . it simply add to the music . it is not really important what the people opinion are .
0	i think this song ha a great message . i love the lyric and the melody . however , the vocalist is not very good and the song is very repetitive .
1	i remembered this song one day . and began researching it online . my flate ather once owned the vinyl record . he frequently played different genre of music music around the house . i grew up loving all kind of music . i have not heard this song since childhood . the vinyl record of course is lost now . this digital song wa sung by much the same/similar original artist i would listened to growing up . it brought back wonderful memory of happy childhood day .
0	if you like to dance , listen to this .
1	this is a pretty good song . it is not bad , but not excellent either .
1	i have got to admit , i have had this cd since it first came out . i am just writing a review now , better late than never . i give the cd is 5 star . yes it is a mellow cd , but it is awesome . just like paul stanley 1978 kiss solo cd , ( my personal favorite ) wa the most mellow of the four , his song i feel were the stongest . just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song , the vocal and the playing is top notch . paul is a master craftsman of song .
1	i had to download the song on my computer because my ipod wa having problem . i wa so excited to listen to this on my ipod .
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood . the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song . it got so low at time i could not really make out the note . but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song . all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little , the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell .
1	i have bought two of these cd and i love the music on both .
0	one of the first thing i thought of when i listened to this album wa that i would been hearing a lot of people tell me that this album wa a hit . i am not sure what to make of this . it is not very good . there is a few song on it that i like , and a couple of others that i do not . the biggest problem with this album is the fact that it is two side of a single track with no fade-outs . that is a bit of a letdown .
0	this song is good but i do not really like it . i like jewel .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
1	a collection of my best recording . nothing fancy , just good music . i like to think these are some of the best of my career .
0	hi , i just bought a new ipod and i want to download the music on there . is there a way to download the music on the ipod or do i have to use the ipod app and download it there ?
0	i wa so excited to download this . i wa so excited to hear this . i am disappointed that i did not get to listen to it . i have been a dylan fan since the early day of dylan . i am not a dylan fan , but i am a sinatra fan . i am so sad to hear that cd doe not live up to my expectation . i could not download the file , despite multiple attempt . i wa a fan of the artist and her music . i wa excited to download the cd . i wa disappointed when i did not receive the cd .
0	this album is definitely a waste of time . all the song are just lame and the production is not that good . i am just not buying it . that is all .
0	i bought the cd for my boyfriend for his birthday . i thought it would be a good pick . i wasnt expecting much . i listened to it in my car and it sounded so good that i thought that i would probably like it . i liked the music so i put the cd into my player and when i went to listen to it another time it wa no longer on the cd player . i waited a couple of week and i went back to the cd player and it wa no longer on there . i contacted the company and they told me that it ha been returned to me . i never expected this . this wa my first album of chris tomlin and i do not know if i will listen to it again .
0	i have just discovered this album and am very impressed . i like much of what i am hearing .
0	very catchy
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) .
1	i think this is a great song . i am listening to it on my ipod at the moment .
1	i love this album . i do not know why i do not listen to all the blue album that i have , but i do not listen to the blue anymore . this album is one of the best blue album that i have ever heard .
0	i like the music and music is what i love in the end .
0	the music of this band is like a song in a movie ; the music is so beautiful that we often forget that it is a movie . the music is so much like the music in movie that we forget that it is a song . the music of this band is a song .
1	this is a great song . i think most of the time , this song is pretty much unlistenable , but it is really fun because the song never slows down . a lot of the time , this song is pretty unlistenable , but it is really fun because the song never slows .
1	i think this is the best hip hop album by a great artist . you need to get this album .
1	i love this album . i am a big fan of lucinda , but i do not know if this is her best work . it is good . it is not great . it is good .
1	
1	this wa one of the first song i remember hearing from the band , and i remember listening to it over and over again . it wa one of the band earliest song , and it is truly one of the most beautiful song they ever wrote . the harmony are soothing , the bass line is beautiful , and the song is truly one of the best song i have ever heard . the lyric are very touching , and the message is very important . i have listened to this song over and over again , and i love it . it is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard , and i truly feel that it is one of the best song i have ever heard .
0	i love the song on this album , but not the album . this disc is full of song that are pretty much identical from one to the next . i have been able to listen to this album twice and i am still left with the same feeling . i do not think this disc is going to change my mind , but it still ha a lot of good song . there is also a lot of filler . i am not sure if it is intentional , or if it is just the way it is , but it make the whole album sound like five separate album . there is no way to separate the song from one another . the only advantage to this cd is that there are some new song on it that are not on previous collection .
0	i actually like this song a lot . i like it a lot . it is a little too basic and repetitive , but it still make you want to dance .
0	the song is not the type of song i like . the song lack of energy . i think it is not fun to sing too .
0	these three song are great . i do not like the sound of the song i would of bought them but i listened to them a lot . but the song are good .
0	i have bought this album on cd and i wa satisfied . i have never had a problem with it . i have listened to it and i have loved it . i have never had to download it . i love this album and i will buy it again . but , i will not buy it again on cd . it is great to have on your computer , but to have it on cd make it a pain in the neck .
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
0	this is the same album without the name change . i really could not stand it when they played it a hellbilly . they should have stuck with the original name . i thought sinister urge wa great but this is a very short album , too short to make any impression .
0	not a fan . skip this song each time .
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
1	a very strong live album . i love this album .
0	this is the most awesome song ever !
1	i love all the material on this album . i really do . everything i have heard from this album ha been so amazing . the mix of old and new is amazing , and the song are just great . i love everything on this album . i give it a 9 .
0	another awful , terrible album .
1	this album is one that you have to get your hand on . there is a song here called lover that make this album worth it , and probably the most amazing song of this collection . the best track on this album are probably killing time , faster , and torn .
1	the best album from the 60 . it is very good . the song are very good . the band is great .
1	i have always loved the yes album and this is the best of the bunch . it really is like a party and ha got to be my favorite album of all time .
0	i thought the whole point of christmas wa that we would all be friend , then i realized that we were just all buying each other present .
1	this song is one of the greatest song ever !
1	i really like the song , a great singer !
0	this wa one of my favorite album of the year . i really liked the vocal and played it in my car for over an hour . i do not think it is worth anything but i do really like it .
0	the song that i wanted is cut off and doe not end correctly . it stop in the middle of a phrase . i could not use it .
1	this wa a very good song , except for the fact that the lyric were very bad .
1	great song .
0	a ha been mentioned in other review , these are not the original hit recording . most , if not all , of the original are available elsewhere .
0	this is one of the most musical song i have heard in a while . this song is a classic , and it is an original song .
0	i heard these song from the first album . all the song sounded good but the vocal were bad . it make me think these song were real . they were recorded in a studio . i liked the first album . i liked the first disk . i liked the first disc . i will buy the first disk . i bought first disk . i bought the first album . i like the first album . i liked the first disk . i will buy the first disk . i bought the first disk . the second disc wa great .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west , their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney , i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice . only one for kanye wa absolutely awful , and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian . rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney , four five second is absolutely very low for both of them .
0	this album is decent and ha some good song .
0	i hate you i hate you i hate you . i had a credit and i tried to use it for two song . they got sent to 2 different folder . now it say the download took too long . and i lost my $ and the song . you stink , amazon . make it easier to spend my own damn money . thanks .
0	this wa one of the worst album i have ever purchased . i love the song so much that i just want to buy them all again .
1	this song is awesome .
1	the arrangement on this cd is terrific . not sure why i did not think of this when i ordered it . i like it .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	i love her voice she ha so many voice . i have a good collection of jennifer lopez song and this is one of them i love this song .
1	this is an excellent album . the album will be played by all type of people . the drummer is excellent . the drummer is good on there own

0	this song is really nice , it is a really good song , and the girl is really good . i like all the vocal on this song . i like the singing , but i think the song could have been longer . i am not sure what i just said , but i do not think that it wa that bad .
1	i loved this album when i wa a kid . i fell in love with the sound of the guitar and the harmony . however , i do not think i ever actually listened to it until i wa in my early 20 . i have listened to it many time since then and it always make me feel happy .
0	i am sorry this cd is so bad . that is the only reason i got it . there are some great song on it , but the whole album is so bad . this is the worst album i have ever heard . i would rather have gotten the old cd of the duke of hazzard .
1	this cd is great ! i really enjoy it .
1	this is a nice song . it
1	my son love it . he ha a drawing pad .
0	this song suck .
1	the first cut is the deepest is a 1967 song written by cat stevens , originally released by p. p. arnold in may 1967. stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december 1967. this one is ok , but cat version is the best .
0	i think that this song is awesome . i love it , and i am not one who enjoys listening to the same song over and over again .
0	great song . music to go along with our thought , good and bad .
0	this is an album i would have been happy to have had in my collection when i wa younger .
1	i have been listening to this song for an hour and i could not stop listening to it . it brings me back to my favorite memory of my grandpa . i will get this song onto my iphone and i will listen to it every night before i go to sleep . it is a beautiful song .
0	this album is good and it ha a good quality .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that .
0	i couldn ’ t believe how bad this cd wa . i am a fan of rap . i wanted to buy it , but i did not . it wa horrible .
0	this is the 2nd version of the daleks calendar . i have had the first version for year and have only seen one picture of the doctor . also this is not the original daleks calendar , it is the second version and the date ha been changed . i have had this for year and am never going to buy the original again .
1	if you are looking for a great set of adam music , this album is it . if you are looking for a great compilation of adam song , this is it .
0	
0	this album is just a bad a bionic - and worse . her voice is just nasty . i should have got a holiday album instead , i did not .
1	it is a great song .
0	i really enjoy this album , but i also have a couple of complaint . first , i think the song are too short . they are usually 3 or 4 minute long and i usually feel like i can not really hear what is going on . i feel like i am missing out on something when i do not hear the rest of the song . next , the guitar solo sound like they are trying too hard to sound like a band that is five or six year younger . they really do not sound like a band from the 80 . i think the guitar solo are supposed to sound that way , but it doe not . it is just that the song seem to be short and short . finally , there are a few song that i feel are just a little too long . i can not really understand the lyric , but i can usually tell what the song is about . i would have liked to have heard a few more song before i had to say i am out of here . i would recommend this album to people who like good music , but i think it is a little too long .
1	this song is a great song . i like it . it make you want to dance .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
1	i am a die-hard fan of this band and have heard so many great thing that i just have to listen . i think this is the best they have done .
0	i really do not appreciate amazon not allowing u to use our reward dollar available on our credit card when we buy mp3s . i do not accrue that many reward credit on my credit card , it would be much more fair if we could use those towards mp3 purchase .
1	i love the album and it ha brought me good fortune . i recommend it to everyone .
0	not only is this one of the best band out there , but they are a really good live act . i have seen them at a lot of show and they are an amazing live act .
1	i am very happy to recommend this cd . this cd is excellent . the song are very well sung . the performance of the song is very good . the only negative thing i can say about this is that the price is a little high . i think that it is a good cd to be shipped to me . i am just wondering why the price is a little high . if you are going to buy this cd , then i would not want you to pay a lot of money . i am happy to recommend this cd to you .
1	i agree with the previous reviewer . this song is very uplifting and i would rate it 5/5 star .
1	i really love this song ! it is a fun song !
1	this is a really good album . i do not think it is for everyone , but if you are just getting into the beatles , or you have not been listening to the beatles for a long time , this is an album you should try . it is a good mix of old and new . i like the album .
1	my fav song on the cd .
1	the music is very relaxing and very peaceful . i would say that this cd ha been a great help when i have needed a few hour to myself . i have listened to this cd several time and have found that it is very relaxing . the cd is very well made . the song are good . the cd is very good . the cd is a very good cd . the cd is a very good cd . this is a good
0	i purchased this cd from amazon because they were the cheapest . i would buy it again , but not on their cheap price .
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
1	this is one of my favorite song to sing in the car . i do not know how to sing along to this song . i usually need to sing along to the radio .
0	one of the best song ever written ! i love this album .
0	i like to download the free song and album to find artist that are different within their genre . sister hazel is not one .
1	this is a good album , but this is an album that ha to be listened to in a special way . i have only heard a couple of track and i am hooked . the song are really good . they are different from most of the metal i listen to . i also like the fact that it is not very technical . this is not a metal album for the metalhead out there . however , this is a good album for me .
0	this album is good , but i do not think that it is that great . the first two song on it are very good , but the rest is not . that is the best way i can describe it , and the reason why i am not a impressed a i wa before i heard the album .

1	i love this song too . i grew up listening to it daily . i think it is very catchy .
1	the first album wa great , the second album wa even better , and the third album is still the best . i listened to a in the car and felt like i wa listening to a movie soundtrack .
0	the only album i have ever heard where i can actually listen to the sound without feeling like i am wearing a headphone . it doe not sound bad in the slightest . i can still hear the music and what is going on . this is one of those album that i really appreciate hearing . i like it . i do not really like it . give it a shot . i would not give it a second thought if it were me .
1	this record ha great production , and good vocal . it ha a great sound to it . the music is very good .
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
0	i heard this song in my church and the band wa great . it wa soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version .

0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .
1	i did not know much about tj & s , but i really like this album . the song are great and you can really hear most of the musician playing on this album . i would say that this album is better than most of the song on the radio . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	the beatles are considered a pioneering group of musician . this album is a collection of song that were first recorded during the beatles early year . it is an album that contains some of their best early work .

0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time .
1	this album is very good . i would recommend it to friend and family .

0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
0	this song is just a little too short . i like it for the lyric and the fact that it is a christmas song , but the music is just so very , very loud that it make the lyric in the song just hard to tell what the song is really about . all that being said , i would not have been able to get through the song without listening to the whole thing . i do really enjoy the song .
1	the song and the album are both great . i thought the song wa a bit slow , but i really like the song .

0	i like to see the band play live . they are one of the best band in the history of music .
0	i have been a big fan of david gilmore for some year now . i found his previous record to be very enjoyable . i think this album is a must have for any david gilmore collection . his previous cd have included many well written and well performed song . this cd is no exception .
1	i like this album . the arrangement are very nice and it make me feel happy every time i listen to it . the only downside is that it take a long time to get through it . the song are very good and the music is soothing .

1	this album wa made for lover of great music ! if your into great music this is the album for you !
0	i did not like this version of this song , but since this wa free , i guess i should not complain .
0	i just looked up the band song and i found out that the song selection is very varied , with the song from this album not listed there . the song list also seems to be out of order , with the song from this album listed first and the one that follow at the end .
1	i tried to download this on my computer and it did not work . i then tried to download the song on my ipad and they did not work either . i wa so irritated by this . i am a music fan and this wa the first time i gave this a chance and i wa not going to try the song on my ipad . i am so over this . i wa so ready to listen to this on my ipad , but i wa not going to give up on it . i guess i will not have to .
0	i am a big fan of this artist , but this is one of the worst album of the year . the two song that are on here , are one of the worst song in rock history , and the rest is just bad . this is a waste of my money , and my time .
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
0	a fantastic album , very well done , just like the cover say , but this album is just a collection of song , and so far , there is not much to it . i enjoy the music , but i just do not like the album . the album is not very good .

0	i really enjoy the band . this band is awesome . this album is awesome .
0	this album is awful . it is been over ten year since they released their last album and i still do not think that this disc is worth anything . the only good thing about this disc is that i do like the cover .
0	i bought this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend , next day i got sued .
0	i absolutely hate this song , it is just a generic song that nobody want to hear . i know the artist , and i just wish i did not know him . really , it is like every song on the radio . it is a crappy song .
1	this is an amazing song ! i have not had a chance to listen to it in quite awhile so i have not yet put it on my list of cd to purchase . but , it one of those song that never get old . i love the song , it is on the cd .
0	i don t know what to say about this cd . it is a cute little song that ha some fun lyric and everything . i do not care what the artist is saying . i do not know why it is so popular .
0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
1	help is another great album recorded by the beatles . few other artist had their rate of consistency . song like help , the night before , ticket to ride , and tell me what you see are true true rock song . act naturally is almost country . you have got to hide your love away , it is only love and i have just seen a face are very much like folk song . yesterday and i need you are classic ballad . no le essential than any of the other beatles album . buy it .
1	this is one of the best metal album i have ever heard .
1	what is amazing about this album is the fact that it is a collection of song that are all so different that you can identify them by their music alone . from the acoustic-instrumental love is a battlefield to the uptempo the dreamer , each song ha it is own sound and style and i love it .
0	the story of this song is very touching and it is just one of the song that i can listen to all the time .
0	it is a really beautiful and lovely song , but it is missing the melody . maybe we have different taste .
1	this song is the best song i have ever heard . i love this song . this song is so catchy and it is a great song to sing along to . great vocal by the band . the song is so well written it will stick with me forever . i love the first chorus and the last chorus . this song is so well written that it will stick with me forever and is a great song to sing .
0	you will love it if you like transsexual rapping .
1	i could tell the song wa going to be good from the first listen . i do like the idea of singing a song about a woman that like girl but ha to be seduced . very hot .
1	this is the most amazing album i have ever heard .
0	a must have for all of you who love christmas
1	i have loved this song for year , and will continue to love it . it is so good . and the video is stunning .
1	i wa very bored for awhile . this is not a song i am going to listen to over and over again . it is a sweet song , but i am not going to listen to it over and over again . i am glad i listened to it , because it reminded me of a song that i like , but i did not expect to enjoy for a long time .
0	i got the song for free , but then i got an email from amazon saying i would have to pay for it , so i went and purchased it . but after the song is on my ipad , that is where the free copy end . also , there is a free trial period , but the song doe not play on the free trial . then there is a monthly fee for the song , but i do not have to pay it .
1	i love the message of this song . it is powerful .
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch . i would seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he would written the song for him . it wa kind , and touching , and the song itself wa great . look for another year at massey hall , i am !
1	a great album ! great sound , great album .
1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford & son new album babel after listening to their first release over and over . so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first . but after a few play through , it grew on me and , while i still believe sigh no more is better album , babel is still a great cd of it own right . i am not a professional reviewer , so i will keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track ( in no particular order ) .
0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
0	a little boring .
1	i love this song ! this is one of my all time favorite . i have watched this movie over and over again , and it is always a favorite with me .
0	: this is the best song ever !
1	this record is excellent . i think the only problem is that it is not available everywhere .
0	i like skyliner but i wish they would put some more effort into their vocal .
0	i had been a fan of this band since they were touring in my high school . they were good , but the sound wa so crappy that i gave up on them . this is the first time i have heard their music in a long time . i have come to like them - even though i still have not purchased any of their album . i am still glad i bought this cd . the song are well written and the vocal are strong .
1	an excellent song ( and prayer ) for every believer ! help me to keep my focus on my heavenly hope . i think most of u long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved one that have gone before u .
0	one song that is listenable but they changed from it is original composition . shame .
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different picture of the eight doctor . they should have name it dr. who and daleks calendar . almost all the picture are from the peter crushing movie or comic book-like picture . there is only one of tom baker and one of john petwee . this calendar should be only for major dr. who and dalek fan .
1	the only album i have ever bought on amazon . i got it for 3 buck and i am sure it wa a mistake but it wa worth it .
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out . i bought it . and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song ( for a total of 18 ) on this version . i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed . i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out . the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy . the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly .
0	i heard this song on a movie and really dug the lyric . have not really listened to it since i downloaded it . the intro wa too long for me , and i do not like the voice they are shaky like there is hardly any talent . once i heard the complete song the lyric are not a impressive a when i heard it on the movie .
0	i would have this album on cd if i could afford to buy it .
0	i got my $ 1,000 back
1	i love this song to sing at the water fountain , at the office , in the car , on a hot day at the beach , or in the shower .
0	this is a good album . it is a little boring but it is not my last album of the year .
0	i am the only one who like this song . not many people i know like it .
0	i have listened to this cd many time , but always with a critical eye , a it is a very personal and subjective album . there are some fine song in this cd , but there are also some song that are just bad . the sound on this cd is very good , but i can not say how good it really is until i am actually listening to the song . i am very happy to have found this cd and think that it will be a good addition to my collection . i will be purchasing another album soon .
1	i have found her on-line several time and i have found her to be a wonderful artist . she is one of the best singer i have ever heard and i have heard a lot . she is a very nice person and i really enjoyed our time together . i bought several cd from amazon . i believe i will be buying more from amazon . i will probably get her cd a few more time . i just can not seem to find it anywhere . i will try again but it is kind of hard to find .
1	in the beginning , i thought this song wa just going to be a pop song . however , after listening to it a couple of time , i realized the song wa actually quite good . every time i listen to this song , i listen to it a if i listened to it for the first time . there is no point in listening to the song again . i have played this song a dozen time and i am still listening to it , trying to figure out how the song ended up sounding the way it did . i love this song .
0	i do not like this .
1	love this and keep it on my kindle and play over and over again . have this on a cd also in my car . quite beautiful !
1	i just wanted to say thank you for putting out this cd . it is great !
1	it is very hard to describe a great album to someone who is not familiar with the artist . i really enjoyed this album . it gave me more than i expected . it give great musical insight and the lyric were very well written . the only negative thing about this album is that it is very repetitive . this is not a bad thing , but it is a minor thing . i would recommend this album to someone that would like good variety in their music . i would recommend this album to someone who liked the beatles , the beach boy , the eagle , the car , and the door . i would recommend this album to someone who would like the beatles , the beach boy , the eagle , the car , and the door .
0	this album is the best , yet i can not say why . it ha all my favorite song from the past two album , but it doe not sound any better . it is just the same song in a different order . i had fun listening to the first album , but now i just do not have any desire to play it .
1	i like the song .
0	i am a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album , virgin & philistine , but with personnel change and a different vibe , this album pale in comparison . terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion , which is still one of my favorite from the mid-80s .
1	i bought four of these . two for myself , just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates . i have a vast sinatra collection . this is one of the top 5 disc . the others being only the lonely , swinging lover , september of my year and the live at the sands.being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot . being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed . it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find .
1	i like the song on this cd .
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand ?
1	this is not a christmas cd . it is pretty much the same a any other cd . it ha a few great song , but nothing special .
1	i have heard this song so many time , and i still can not get over how good it is .
0	this wa a very good christmas album . the album start off with i believe in jesus , but it becomes very boring after that . there are some very good song in this album , but the whole album is very bland . i did enjoy the song i believe in jesus but at the end of the album , it becomes boring and the album is very bland .
0	great song . great lyric .
0	
0	this wa a nice song , and i like the backing vocal .
1	i have a bob dylan fan in my house and i love this album . i love bob dylan .
1	i have been looking for a cd to listen to all my favorite . this is it . i have listened to a lot of different cd that i really love . this cd music is just what i wa looking for .
1	i have an old sony walkman , and i have been looking for a digital music player for my car , for the past few week . i finally found one . after i played the first song , i noticed that it wa not playing my cd , or mp3 . i emailed the company and asked for a refund and they emailed me back and said it wa a problem with the player , and asked me to please send picture of the player to prove it wa the player . i did . i sent picture a to what it look like and what it is like inside . i also had a picture of the screen . i received an email back with a response stating i needed to come to a store to get a replacement . i went to the store and asked the man to look inside the player and look at the screen . he did . he said the screen wa fine , and it wa the player that wa the issue . i asked if there wa a warranty on the player . he said there wa not a warranty , and he would not be able to give me a refund or exchange . i told him i would have to return the product . he then told me that i could return it , or i could send it back to amazon . i sent it back to amazon . they refunded my money , but then told me that i could send the item back to the store if i wanted to . i told them that i thought it wa the most annoying thing in the world to have to send back a product . they said they were only going to give me a refund and would not give me a refund or exchange . here is the kicker . i found a different player that i thought wa going to be the same exact model . it wa . i called the store back and asked for a refund and a refund and exchange . they said they only refunded the money . i then asked how much money i would have to pay . they said that the store would be happy to refund that amount and exchange the product . i told them i am not in the business of buying product in hope of getting a refund . i said i am in the business of buying product in hope of getting a good product , a cheap product , or something in between . i told them that i would be
1	i have never really liked this song , but i am a huge fan of christmas is coming . i really do like this song and it make me smile when i hear it . this song is a great song to play when you want to get into the holiday spirit .
1	i think this is one of the best record of all time . it is not the best record by nirvana , it is the best album by nirvana . the production is great and the song are great .

0	i really like this album . the music is very soothing .
1	it is a very nice song .
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	i liked this song when i first heard it . i love this song for real . the song is really really good . it is better than dancing in the street and it is better than inner city blue it is probably better than all of those song combined . this song make me feel good .
0	this is not the version that you are looking for . have not found the version sung on ondine yet . dang it !
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not .
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
0	i thought this album wa okay . it is a typical pop album in the worst way . in fact , it is a terrible album . i think that it is a terrible album .
0	i love the song . i think it is a good song , but i am not a fan yet .
1	this song is awesome !
0	she ha a wonderful voice and is always singing very well . always a hit with the child at church , and sometimes adult .
0	i loved this song . the song is very catchy and ha a good melody and lyric . the vocalist is not very good and the song is very repetitive .
1	this is very good . i like the song on this album .
1	this is a great album .
0	the first song on the album is a very good one ! i like how they start off with a very soft and gentle melody that gradually increase in intensity
0	this is the worst album i have ever heard . i am sure this is the worst album i have ever heard . it is bad .
0	this cd is good , but i do not think it is worth the price .
0	i bought some album and they have not been released yet . i really like this album . it is a great album . i am surprised that this album ha not been released yet .
1	i will say that this is a great song to play at the 40th anniversary of the us enterprise . it wa a great song that made me feel good . it wa a great song that made me feel good .
0	a song that i know my wife will enjoy !
1	the best band ever ! one of the best band ever ! one of the best band i have ever heard ! one of the best band i have ever heard ! i love this band ! i love this band ! i love this band ! this band is great ! this band is great ! this band is great ! wow ! wow ! wow ! wow ! wow ! this band is great ! i love this band ! i love this band ! they are great !
0	i have always been a huge fan of weezer so when i heard this album and this artist i really wanted to like it . but it wa pretty dull and uninteresting and i could not get into it . i do not know why , it just did not grab me .
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
1	this is a great album . i think this album is the best album soundgarden ha ever done . i also think it is a great album of the one by this band . i think the one thing that is missing from this record is pork and bean but i think the rest of the album is great . i would put this record up against the best album of the past two decade . this album is definitely a must for any soundgarden fan .
0	sum 41 ha no talent . they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible . if you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre , try new found glory , the ataris , or maybe older blink-182 material . this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason . it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there . do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band .
0	i got it for free . at 1st i did not really like it . i like black veil bride and the fray . it is just not my kind of music . now i like this song though . i had to hear it a couple of time before it hit home .
1	i love this cd . it is really good . i recommend it !
0	this is his worse album every . the lyric suck and his beat suck . he claim to be the best but he is not . the worse song are theee forth of the disk . he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	i am giving this album a 4.5 star out of 5 star . it ha a lot of good song but i am not sure how many of them are actually worth buying . some song are good and some song are terrible . the way the song are put together is to hard for me to listen . some of the song sound like they are from the same album . it definitely seems like this is not their first album though . i did not really like the first album either . i do not know if this is a good or bad album . i like the song that are on there . i do like this album . i do not really like the song on this album ( i can not decide if i like them or not ) . this is the only album i have ever bought by this band .
1	the song wa really good , but the quality of the file wa very low and the song wa very short so i am not sure if i can put it on my cd collection
1	it is a fantastic song and video , that i love . i think the video is the best thing about the song , with the dancing and the old lady .
1	this song suck : p
0	i got this cd a few month ago and i have not been able to download it . i tried it a couple of time but it will only play on my mobile phone . i tried to download it off my laptop but the file would not download . i am very upset because this song is a great song and i wanted to listen to it . i really want to listen to this song but it is not working : ( . i hope it will work on my other computer soon .
1	i wa surprised at how much i enjoyed this album . i have heard a lot of music from this band and have been meaning to buy this album for year . i hope that they come out with a double cd with a lot of new material .
1	our first dance a husband and wife wa to this song . i hope we are dancing to it for year to come .

0	this is a good song but i do not like to listen to it when i am driving .
0	a really excellent collection of christmas music , featuring some exceptional performance by the artist themselves .
1	overall , this is a really good album . i like the fairytale and let u dance song the best .
1	it is really fun to listen to music and watch video on the small screen . the speaker is very easy to use , i love the fact that the sound is controlled to my satisfaction and it can be adjusted to how i want it to sound .
1	this is the first album i ever purchased of yolandes . i had a lot of trouble with this album , a it seems to be recorded in a different style than yolandes previous album . it is a very good album by a good artist .
1	this is a good album . i like it a lot . the song are good .
0	i like the song , but i have to say i think i would have preferred a slower , more mellow melody .
1	this song rock . the way it start , and the way it end are awesome .
1	this is a great song . i always sing this song along with my husband when we are out walking . this song make me feel good about myself . i feel like i can achieve anything if i just keep on singing . i think this song is true and i think it great that you can inspire someone to achieve something . this song is a great way to start your day . i recommend it .
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . however , the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face ) . i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters .
0	this album is very good . the song i do not trust you is one of my favorite on it .
1	this is the best band ever . they are the best band ever . they have a lot of talent . they have a lot of song . they have a great stage show . they are the best band ever . they have a great sound . they are the best band ever . they have a great stage show . they are the best ever . they have a great stage show . they have a great sound , and a lot of great song . they are the best band ever . they have a great song , and great music in their music . they have a great stage show . they are the best . i love them . they are the best band ever . they have a great voice . they have a great sound . they have a great stage show . they have a great sound , and a lot of great song .

1	this is the most beautiful song i have ever heard . the music is very calming and the lyric are very beautiful . i love this song .
0	this is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performance ever recorded . the cracking noise make it almost unlistenable , completely unworthy of the quality of gmos fine session . you can hear the crackle in the preview - yes , it is that bad and worse all the way through . i am surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy ; sound like it wa made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment . this recording of the same performance is much cleaner : http : / www .
0	i just adore this album . if you are a fan of pop/dance/electronic music , this is the album for you !
0	i purchased this album to listen to when i went to see the rocky horror picture show and i have to say that i am not impressed . the recording are terrible , and the quality of the video is poor . the singing is mediocre .

0	this is not a bad album , but it is overproduced and not very good .
1	i have spent hundred of dollar on home theater equipment over the year , and i have never been disappointed . i purchased this speaker because i wanted to play my music and listen to other audio source at the same time . i have nothing bad to say about this speaker .

1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note , and everything he play is so tasteful and rich . yum .
1	this band is one of my favorite band . i love their song and i have heard on this website that they are really good .
0	i downloded this song to listen to new music , but it is not my preference . it is a very experimental music for my preference .
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) .
1	an awesome pure worship experience that you will want to experience over and over again and never get tired of listening to !
0	i am a fan of rob zombie , but this album is just kind of a let down . it doe not have anything to do with rob zombie at all . it just sound like rob zombie other music . if he were a real guitarist he would have made this album . i would like to hear a little rob zombie . if he were a real guitarist he would have made this album instead of a boring one .
0	i wa expecting a lot from this album , and i got a lot . i would have to say this is one of the best album i have played in a long time . this album ha great tune , catchy lyric , and a great , unique , and unique message . if you want a great song , you can not go wrong with this album !
0	the music is well layed out and engineered extremely well but the lyric make me want to slap this guy for being a whining as . his voice bore the crap out of me .
0	ton of scratch and record skip .

0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season . 1/3 of the christmas are offensive , explicit , and revolting , and it is not even a week into december . i saw that it wa lady gaga , so i wa wary at first , but i decided to give the preview a chance . light me up and put me on top ? really amazon , really ? christmas spirit includes carol , wintery atmosphere , giving , etc . not sexual innuendo . so disappointing , esp . after the first great song by casting crown .

0	this guy is an idiot . he ha a good website , he ha a good album , but he ha a hard time with people like me who think country music is the greatest thing ever . but he doe not know what he is talking about . his album is so over rated , even his website is over rated . i have to go with the first person to tell the truth , and the rest of the country music fan must hate him , and i must hate him . he and his website are a joke ! . and his album is so over rated , he is got to be a freakin genius when he put out 2 album in a row !
0	i am very glad that i bought this cd , even though i have not listened to it enough to make a final decision on it . i really like the song , but the quality is poor . i have owned it for a few month and it still sound a if it is recorded on a cassette deck . i have never heard the sound quality of this particular cd go this low . i am still very happy that i bought the cd and it ha been a very good purchase .
1	this is a great cd from the oldie i loved when i wa a kid . i can not wait to dig this cd out and play it .
0	this song is pretty much the only decent song on the album . i wa wrong is a great song . there are a lot of mediocre song on this album . take me out is a good song , but it is also a song that is almost completely ignored . i wan na go home is an average song , but only because of the average quality of the recording . i wa wrong is the only decent song on this album .

1	i really like it , a great song !
0	i really get sad when i hear this new rap crap on top of the greatest band ever . i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were . maybe show of 50 or 75 people . that wa the good ol day . god do i miss the house man !

1	i first heard lou reed in a local radio station where it wa played . i listened on repeat for the next 30 year . i now own almost every lou and reed album and this is the only one i bought while in high school , and it is one of the only album i have never purchased during my 20 . i am an original lou reed fan and this is just my favorite .
1	so far , this is the best cd of billy squier . i have listened to her cd and this is the best cd so far . she is a very talented singer and an excellent musician . this cd is better than most of her other cd . her singer is great , the other part are great too . i love all her cd , but this one is good .

1	_ _ _
0	this album is awesome , i have listened to it several time , and it is worth the listen .
1	i used to get so nervous before going to a dead show . i would always get a hard on in the morning . i would never get the chance to see the dead live before i got to see them in 1975 .
1	this wa a gift for my brother and i love listening to it .
0	a many people may know by now , sony wa recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd ( van zant : get right with the man ) from sony music not only installed drm software ( digital right management , to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain device ) , but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from window , and opened the system up to security issue such a virus .
1	i love the song .
1	this album is worth buying . this album is worth buying . this album is worth buying .

0	i have been listening to alex clare for year . i like his new cd .
0	i am not a big fan of pete rock , but this album is alright . i do not know why he would put this album out , but it is alright .
0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter , mostly a good cover band with a livewire , athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock . probably a great bar band when they started out . i saw them twice in their early day , when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best . loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band . unfortunately , whatever vocal talent he ever possessed , ha long since evaporated .
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
1	i love this cd ! it is a good compilation of song .

1	this album rock my world . i would recommend this album to anyone who like zaba .

1	it is going to be ok
0	i like it a lot and this song is very good
1	loved this song ! i downloaded it and played it a lot while i wa in school . i wish i could download it again .
1	i wa disappointed that this wa a new release , but i still enjoyed it . i purchased it because it would be a good introduction to the song of the cranberry and because i have always liked it , but i did not feel like it wa an album per se . i wa more of a fan of the band when they were still on the radio . i really enjoyed the music of the cranberry and it would be a great song to listen to while taking a bath . i also bought this because i love the cranberry and because the song all i want is one of my favorite .
1	i am glad to be able to purchase this album . i am a music lover , and i have been listening to lou reed music for the past 35 year . i have listened to three of their album and this is the first time i have listened to all three album
1	i wa trying to fall asleep to this and could not quite fall asleep , but i enjoyed it so much that i fell asleep after it .
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
1	this song is so well written . it is the kind of song that make you want to believe that he is talking to you and he is telling you the truth . it feel genuine and it make me feel really good about the world .
0	this wa the best thing i have ever heard . i wa so excited i got it on cd for my friend . she had all kind of music , so i got the house man album . i love it . this is the best cd ever . the best cd i have ever heard . if i could get a 5 star rating i would do it in a heart beat . i am so glad i got it on cd . i am glad that my friend got it . i am glad that i got it . i am glad that i got it .
1	this album is a good listen . there are several really good song on this album , and some of the le good song are very good too ( including a few greatest hit , song that shouldve been on the other album ) . but really , this is a great album in general . great mix of music , different type of music , and great vocal .
1	i love this song and it wasnt available on itunes ! amazon had it and for cheap
0	i am not sure what this song is about . it is repetitive and it is not that beautiful .
1	a good cd . i will buy another .

0	very good cd . i like that it ha the whole cd . it doe not have all the song on it .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
1	i love this song ! it is so good that i would buy the cd just for it . it is very catchy and very cute . this whole album is such a fantastic find . my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song , but , this is one of our top pick !
0	i got a lot of the same thing here . i really like the band vocalist , but i think it wa the sound of her voice that made me dislike the album . i got it a couple of week ago and i have to say that i am not really a fan of their album . their song are overproduced , and they sound nothing like their older album . this is the second time i have heard them and i just can not stand them anymore . the only time i can listen to their music on is when i have to help out with my sister music . i can not stand their music , and i know that i am not alone .
1	this is one of the best worship album i have heard in a long time . it combine a variety of different style of music into one awesome body of work . it is one of the best worship album you will hear in a long time .

0	if you love floyd , this is a decent tribute set .
1	i love this song and i love the lyric on this song . the only thing that i do not like is that the band seems to play some sort of alternative rock song on this song . i would like to hear some more song from this band though .
1	i lost my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here . great love song .
1	i would rate this 5 star if it were better . a it is , it is a good song with a great melody and lyric . the singer is very talented and the song is very simple . i would like to have the cd with the vocal that are on the cd . the song is very easy to sing along with . the lyric are very easy to sing along with . although the song is a little corny , i love the song and would like to have it again . i would recommend this to anyone who love the beatles . this is a very good , clean song and is a hit with everyone . it is a catchy song for a beginner singer because of the easy lyric . i would rate this 5 star if it were better . this is a very good song with a great melody and lyric . this is a very good song for beginner singer because of the nice melody and lyric . the singer is very talented and the song is a hit with everyone . the lyric are very easy to sing along with . the song is very easy to sing along with . although the song is a little funny , i love the song and would love to have the cd with the vocal that are on the cd . i would rate this 5 star if it were better . the song is a very good song with a great melody and lyric . the song is very good for beginner singer because of the nice melody and lyric . i would rate this 5 star if it were better .
1	this song really rock !
0	i purchased this after seeing them live during the clapton 2010 crossroad event and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here hoping to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance , especially considering the material . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and , even the live rendition , do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear his voice when he is playing guitar . i would recommend this to fan of lou reed and john zorn , but it is not really one to buy and listen to over and over if you are not familiar with the music . i would give it a 5 star rating , but only because the band did a really great job here .
0	this album is great . i have only listened to this album a few time , but i can say that i love it . i wish the lead singer wa a girl .
0	i love this album . it is my favorite album by rihanna and her only album i own .
1	i have to admit that i do not know what i wa thinking when i bought this . i like the song from this album , and i am a huge pink floyd fan . this is the best floyd album i have ever heard .
0	this wa a very good album , but not worth the price . this album is not worth getting .
1	wishbone ash ha always been a favorite of mine and these recording are exceptional in quality
1	what i really like about this disc is that it is a cd that will help to bring back the blue . this is an album that should be played at every concert i ever make . i will be buying more of these disc , and hopefully more of them will be blue .
0	wow . i wa blown away by this album . there is not a bad song on this album . this is a great album and a great band .
0	i have purchased this album several time a i love hank williams and this is a great album . the hank jr. record is a real nice album .
1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music , it melody and lyric a well a it arrangement and performance , i find this cd one of the most beautiful recording of all-time . once again and a always , the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standard from the great american songbook . this cd will take u to a musical journey a we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music .
0	i bought this cd for my son . it is very good . i am glad i bought it .
1	i like the song . i like the song . i like the song . i like the song . it is catchy and ha a good beat
0	this one is so bad , i do not know if it is even worth talking about . i heard the track from the cd , and they are horrible . i can not believe that these track are in public . i have never heard anything like them . i am a fan of both crooked i & royce . i wa a fan of royce , but i stopped listening to him a long time ago . i would love to hear more of his material , but this is just so disjointed and i do not understand how this man get a fair chance to say anything new . i am not trying to be negative , but these are the worst track on the cd , and i do wish he would get on the radio somewhere . this is just so disappointing . the album is supposed to be a tribute to royce , and instead , he is just using his material to say the same thing that royce said . i am not bashing royce or crooked i , but there should be something new to the fan of royce & crooked i. not just the same . this is just stupid . the original royce wa a great lyricist . he could write a song about anything !
0	i am not sure if i love this album or hate it , it just doe not do it for me . i have listened to this album a total of 50 time over the past 6 year and i still can not seem to hit the magic song to make it stick in my head . i know i am not alone in this .
1	i love this cd
0	the cd is good , but i do not like the lyric of the song . they are not original and do not add anything to the music .
0	dear sir or madam , i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd . however , it must be good to use the right half of our brain , which is usually not used .

0	disappointed , but never with much hope . it is a shame .
1	ahmads music is simply superb . his playing is so beautiful and his interpretation are so deep . his playing is the perfect combination of the beauty of the music and the beauty of the human voice . he play with a true reverence for the music of the great . he make the music his own and , in so doing , make it an even greater pleasure for the listener to listen to .
0	this wa the first album i ever bought , and the only one ever that i ever have bought . of course , i will rate it a 5 because it is got good song that have gotten a lot of radio airplay . i do not really have any bad thing to say about this album . i do not think i have ever come across this album before . it is quite different from other album i have heard , and i like it . i think the reason why i like it is because i like the new song , and i like the old song . the new song sound like they are trying to be something else , but i like them . the old song sound like they are the same old thing they are , but i like them .
0	this song wa a little too repetitive . it doe not have a good enough chorus .
1	country continues to turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach . adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song , which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war . this is a poignant and important recording , and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric .
0	this is a great album , but it is too long .
0	i wa excited to get this album and listen to it while i wa at work , and it ha been very enjoyable .

0	this is a great album that i listened to a lot , but i am not sure why i am still liking it . i would say it is a good album , but still not for me .

0	i am a big skyliner fan . i like all their material except for the last couple of song . i wa hoping this would be a fun and good rockin album , but it is a terrible waste of time .
1	i have listened to this album for about 3 hour and i am hooked . it is a very upbeat album . i do not know what other album are like this , but this one is definitely one of a kind .
0	i bought this album , but after listening to it for a few day i realized that the only thing i can say is that i am a very big hank williams fan and i have purchased many album from other hank williams fan and they have all been excellent .
0	it is a pretty song , with great vocal , but i am not sure about the lyrics/message . once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased- sound rather morbid to me . not a great choice for a christmas song . sure it ha a christmas-y sound , but if you really listen , it is not about anything to do with christmas . is it just me , or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far ? i really enjoyed this 25 day of free downloads advent-type calendar last year .
1	i am not a fan of slipknot . i am a fan of song with a good story and catchy tune . slipknot is a great band . i have been a fan of slipknot since the first album i bought in 1998. the story that snakehips is telling is worth the listen . it is important to hear the story from the beginning to the end .
1	if this wa all you got for prime it would be worth it . amazon , i love you !
0	some of the song here could have been better . however , i am a huge fan of adam and find this to be a great collection of song . if you are looking for a great set of adam music , this is it .
1	if you are an adopted child who feel that empty space in your heart or someone who want to understand then listen to this song .
1	i have downloaded the mp3s from the site , and i have been listening to them on my computer . i like them on my car stereo , and a my mp3 player . i think this site is great . i can recommend this website and the mp3s for anyone who is interested in music .
0	it is very good . i love it . i purchased two copy of the album both of which i will make sure to take out to my old friend who is still living in the area where i grew up .
1	this is a really good album ! it ha good music . my only real complaint about it is the fact that the lead singer is not a woman . i would love to see a band with a lead singer that is not a man .
1	*
1	this song is a great one . it is a song that is so smooth and soothing and it is really fun to listen to . there is also a lot of instrumentation added to the song so it is nice and pretty . the vocal are kind of harsh so it is hard to pick out the lyric sometimes , but it is worth it . i like when they do thing like this , and i like hearing them do it . it is really fun to listen to .
0	i wa a fan of this band for a long time , and i wa excited to hear them perform . unfortunately , this album wa a let down , it wa a little too much for me to take . i wa hoping to see one of my favorite band that i have been to see in many year . i just did not get the same feeling that i had when they first started . that is not to say there were not good song on the album , but it wa not the same . i would not recommend this for an o.a.r . fan . if you like o.a.r . and you have not heard them in a long time , then this is your album . if you do not like these guy , then this is not a great album to listen to .
1	here it is ! i can not believe how much the song ha changed from the original ! it is like we got a new song ! i am glad i found this old version on the internet . i have added it to my music collection in a digital format , it is now available for anyone to hear .
0	this is a very good song . it is got a very good message , and it is got a very good message . the vocal are great . the only thing that i do not like about this song is that the song is very loud .
0	my husband like this song . i do not . i do not like the way he sings it . i just do not like the song .
0	i really like the way the music is produced on this cd . the vocal are amazing , and the music is great . the only problem is that it is not the best . the song are not very interesting , and there is nothing new on this cd .
0	i do not understand this at all . there are no redeeming quality to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist . i am a avid a fan of bob dylan a there is but he doe not serve himself well with atrocity such a this or that inane christmas album . i have to go listen to blood on the track and oh mercy now before my mind implodes .
0	if you like country music , you should buy this album . and if you do not , you should give it to the dog .
1	i bought this album while on a trip to the bahamas and the music , although not exactly what i expected , wa actually very good . i do not know how many time i have to listen to this album , but i think it is a must have for any alex clare fan .
0	a good album . i like the guitar work but the drum are a bit off .
0	i know lot of folk love this album . i have been a huge boc fan since they started in 72. i can not listen to this album . except for the remake of astronomy , the song are awful . boc always have great song , very melodic , a pleasure to listen to . this is not true on this album . one bad album out of all their album is not a tragedy . they continue to put out good album to this day . i will be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july 20. i guarantee they will not be playing any song from this dog .
1	i got this for my son for christmas and he love it . he play it all the time . this is a great collection . he ha to go out and buy the other one . i will let him pick them out himself .
1	i have heard this album many time , and like it . i am a big fan of classical music . classical music ha been an important part of my life for many year .
0	i would have rather liked a song that wa dedicated to keith emerson , but the rest of the track are a bit weak .
0	for one , it wa the short verision or radio version . also , they gave the impression that it wa un-edited but it wa , not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar . i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content .
0	this cd is a real winner ! i have listened to it about 3 time now and each time i am finding new thing to like . i have never listened to a song without hearing the lyric ( which i love ) and this cd is not just a song without lyric . the lyric are there in all of the song and i just love the way she make them sound . i really like it
0	considering the review and the pedigree and the musicianship . just no soul , the singing . voice , doe not work ( for me ) i get - that they are good - just reminded me of the good stuff from the 70
0	this song is so awful . i can not believe how awful this music is . this is the worst music i have ever heard . this is the worst thing i have ever heard in my life

0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
0	i have never heard anybody sing like this . i am so sorry , but it is true . i have listened to this song several time and have not heard anybody sing like this . in fact , many of the song on this cd are not singer i would ever want to listen to singing . i am ashamed to say that i have never heard anybody sing like this . i would be more apt to buy this cd if the singing were more like a johnny rodriguez song . i will have to pas . i am ashamed to admit that this cd is not for me .
0	i really like her earlier cd , but this one is not a good a her other cd . i like her newer cd , but this one is not a good a her other cd . i do like her new cd , but i think this one is a little boring
1	this song ha a positive mood to it . i like it a lot .
1	i have been listening to this album for year . i feel like it is the best hip hop album of all time . i know it is going to be a classic .
0	, it is not a song i will listen to again .
1	excelent damn donna u did it again u came through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being cheesy or to religious something i needed at this point in my life thank you i love you a life long fan
0	this is a nice album , but their sound is very old . they are not bad , but they are just not cutting edge . i will rate this album with an 8 because there are some good song on it . i just do not feel that the song are that good . i have been listening to this album for a long time , and i am still not feeling it .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year , where her voice ha lost it luster , and she really ha not stopped for herself . musically , she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song . her latest song , diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course . i really did not find the song to deliver , a some of her earlier song had . i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice .
1	this wa a very good song . it is very good .
0	this a very good song .
0	this song suck it is not even a good song . it is not even a good song .
0	this is a good album . not a huge fan , but i like it . i do think that they could have put more out at this point in the year though . it is not terrible , but i do not know if i would buy another album by them .
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can .
1	i think this song should be number one , but it is too short .
1	i bought this group for my daughter and i wa glad i did . i have a drawing pad . it is not good for my ipod . it doe not have a lot of song . it ha a lot of song . it ha a lot of song
1	a great song from k-lo . it is a nice change of pace for the christmas season . i think it is a must have .
0	i am not a huge fan of this song because it is too similar to another song . the guitar solo start way too fast and there are very few lyric . however , the chorus is awesome and the song is catchy . the only thing that spoil it for me is that it is more of a ballad than a rock song .
1	i think this song is very fun . it is a really good song .
1	this song is fun , and easy to sing along to . this song is for the lady that ha the biggest heart in the universe . i love this song because it is happy and i want to sing along with it . i like this song because it is fast and it make you want to dance .

1	i can not wait for his next album .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
0	i always liked this song . i like the werewolf of london too . he is a great classic rock artist to listen to .
1	i like song that make me feel good , not just happy - this is one of the few album that i like that make me feel happy . i hope they make more music like this - i have listened to more than 60 album in the last few year and this is one of them
1	i love this song .
0	i bought this cd by mistake and wa a little disappointed that it contained the same song that were on the cd that i got for free . i got the cd because it wa on sale and i love song by simon & garfunkel , but i would have preferred to have got the cd that came with the free cd i got a a gift from my parent .
0	you can not always get what you want . i like that song . i like the song you can not always get what you want . i like the album .
1	the i love you chorus is what i will remember about this song the most . it is so sweet and i want to sing it whenever i feel down .
1	i bought this record because the band wa opening for the killer so i had to have it . it is really well produced and ha great song .
1	this is an amazing album . if you have not heard it you should .
0	
0	this album wa not a good start for the fan of the band . i am not a huge fan of the band but i have to give the album a 2 out of 5 star ( the album wa great ) . i do not feel the new song will make up for the album lack .
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	this is the best bluegrass album ever ! it ha some of the best song ever . the song are very bluesy , but they are really good .
1	i love the song . i am a big fan of amanda shire . i love her music and her song . i have had a chance to listen to all of her song . her music is wonderful .

1	if you enjoy great music , this is the band for you . a must have . if you enjoy great music , this is the band for you . i hope stryper will have a second album in the future . i will buy it .
1	if you like blue and you like rock , this is your ticket . not only can joe play some awesome guitar , he is also got a great voice to go along with it . i just now discovered joe and am in love with his music ( my wife is too ) . great guitar , great singing , great beat , great band . what more can you ask for ? if his other work is a good a this , then i will end up owning every cd he ha . seriously , if you do not like this cd and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor .
0	if you are a beatles fan you should have heard this album . this wa their first studio album ( and therefore the first album to use the word studio album in it title ) . most of the track on this album were written and recorded in the studio . this album wa released in september 1965 after their first uk tour in the fall of 1964. the first single wa i saw her standing there . it wa a hit and wa a number 1 hit on the billboard hot 100 , and a number 1 hit on the cash box top 100 .

1	
1	it is a good song . it is a good song . it is a good song .
0	this song ha a good beat and it is a little bit repetitive .
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent . so when they put out christmas album , they knew what would work , and what would not , and made their musical selection accordingly . you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement . but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously . some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious , and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice .
0	i like the song ! it is a good song !
1	: this is a very nice version .
1	i love this song , and it is a good song .

0	this is a great album of great music .
1	i am a big fan of the band and the music and lyric are very good .
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
0	the first and last time i heard this song wa on the soundtrack for the 1989 film the body starring nicolas cage in a very bad movie . the song is about the suicide of the young girl portrayed in the film who is murdered by the film villain . it wa a very dark and heavy song which i wa quite surprised to hear on vinyl .
1	i wa excited to buy this a it seemed to be the most bebop-sounding album i had heard yet .
0	carrie underwood is a real fraud and a fraud is a real girl .
0	this is a collection of song that all have a very similar feel to each other .
0	this collection is just what i expected . you get a few good song , but the majority of them are not really that great .
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of white noise in the background and many song cut off half way through .
0	bought it to sell it back to the record company . i did not think it wa worth it . i got a cd of bob marley song . i just wanted to try to sell it to get a little money back . i thought the cd wa worth it . but , it wa a big disappointment . it is not bad , but i did not like it .

0	so when you are looking for some really great oldie , you might want to search out the very first album they put out , because this is the best . ( okay , maybe not the best album in the first place ) . it is a lot of fun , and i like the way they are doing it ; they are just playing the song , and you are hearing them . it feel like the old day when they were playing music together in the back of the closet in the old barn , and you would just let them hang out and sing and play and drink and talk about their life for hour . i dig this kind of stuff . i like it when a band put out a song they can play any time they feel like it . this is a nice , little collection of song , and it is all a lot of fun .
1	i love this cd . i have listened to it over and over and i have yet to get tired of it . it is such a wonderful gift . i would not exchange it for anything .
0	this song is a great song ! this song is a great song ! this song is a great great song ! i love this song ! i love this song ! i love this song !
1	if i had to choose my favorite song of fall out boy , this would be it .
1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded wa der teufel and the sound fill the room . i recommend the cloud and the schubert for.89 , how can you go wrong .
1	the band in this cd may be the best known of it genre in the country music world . their style is what i call country ( or old time , if you will ) . i do not consider this to be a country band ; this is more of a bluegrass band . it is a band with a great blend of acoustic and electric instrument , with some very unique and distinctive style . if you are a bluegrass fan ( or want to be ) , this is a great album to check out .
1	a perfect song that is what i say perfect song .
0	when i discovered amazon cloud i thought i had found the end all be all of music , and amazon cloud is the end all be all of music .
1	i bought this album for my husband . he love heavy metal and he ha many musical preference . he usually enjoys classic rock , but is not a huge fan of rap . i would recommend this album to him because it is a good mix of different type of music and he will enjoy it .
0	this album is a lot better than i expected it to be . it is not a very good album , but the melody are really good . it is a good album to listen to if you need a good song to have a good day .
1	this album just keep getting better and better .
1	i have listened to this album at least 20 time and i just love the song on it . i can not stop listening to it . this album ha everything i want on an album .

1	i love this song . the melody and musicianship are great . i listen to this song when i lift weight and in the morning a i am getting ready for work .
0	i like the overall sound of this album , but i do not like the lyric . i would have it removed if i knew that steve harris and adam lambert would ever record together .
0	0304 see jewel cross-over from her folk-country root to pop . laced with heavy beat and keyboard , this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense . whereas , jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling , this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her . her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener . i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me .
1	this is a really good cd . i love the music , and the lyric , but some of the song are just too long . i think this cd would be great if the song wasnt so long . i need them to cut it down .
1	i do not know if you have heard of this album but it is awesome . if you have not you should check it out . it ha several song that have won the grammys . they are about an hour long , very beautiful , and they have just the right amount of emotion . this is a very good album . i would give it 5 star
0	not a hip hop song , but this is not bad
0	most of these are only portion of the song , such a 1 verse and the chorus . i would prefer the entire song . also , many are done with a country feel to them , not the traditional music you would hear in church . i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with , and it is not a hit . wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i-tunes wa 3 time the price .
1	liz ha had a rough couple of year . with that being said , she ha come out the other side stronger than ever . with more of a blues/rock sound and hard living lyric exodus of venus is her best work to date .
1	this song will be the first song i buy on itunes .
0	this sounded like something that someone just threw together . i could not use any of it and none of the song were complete .
0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here . i remember seeing an interview of the newest ( at the time ) leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos . sure we are entitled to forgiveness , but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory . after rjd ha passed no le . onto the music . the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire .
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .
1	a very good song , i like the song , and the vocal are good .
0	?
1	this song is awesome !
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes , and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own . railroad earth ( 6 piece new-grass jamband ) provides great support giving all these song ( 8 out of 13 which are haynes original ) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel ( like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail ) . i enjoyed the whole of disc1 even though haynes song writing itself is only so-so , and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc 2 are not bad , although none of them seem essential .
0	this band is just making one hit after another . i think they could make a few album and take their time to make them better rather than releasing their one hit after another album . i wish they would just make an album that ha good song instead of trying to be the next big thing ; they are just not that good . i do not think they are that good , but i do not think they are that bad either .
0	i listened to this album and i really liked it . i do not know why it did not get me going .
0	the only thing that will keep me from buying this album is the fact that i have to have it in a vinyl format . i do not have a cd player and i do not know if i could ever find a vinyl version of this album . however i think i am going to get this album and be able to listen to it a many time a i want to with no worry . i always like to support independent artist .
0	i bought this because it wa on the top of the list for my wife . that is all it wa . i would not recommend this cd to anyone . i would rather suck my own asshole and vomit the entire content of my stomach through a straw . i would rather eat my own shit and vomit it through a straw . i do not even know who this song is by . that is all , amazon . you are a horrible company .
1	this album is very well produced and sound like a mix of many different type of music . this is a very good soundtrack to listen to .
1	i have been waiting for this song since i heard it on the radio . i have been hearing it a i have been driving . it is an awesome song . the lyric are very moving and the music is awesome .
0	i like to listen to the beginning .
0	this is a very good cd . it is definitely one of the best album i have ever purchased .
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
1	my favorite song is when the guy ha a heart attack . i think that is the best song of all . do not stop , no matter what .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song . not satisfied !
0	one of the best song this year .
0	i wa going to buy this cd to play on the car stereo , but i could not bring myself to actually listen to it . it is really good . it is a very enjoyable song and the vocal are very pleasant and the harmony sound just perfect . i had high expectation for this cd . the first time i listened to it , i wa very happy . but , after listening to it for about two week , i am just starting to enjoy it again . i just do not find this cd to be anything but average . i am not a fan of acoustic music or folk music ( and i am a country girl ) , but this cd ha been a pleasant surprise . i hope that if you enjoy this cd , you also like the other two cd in the series . i am not sure whether you are a fan of acoustic music or folk music , but it is nice to have a cd that represents both . i will say , however , that it is a little over long at 35 minute , but i do not listen to it that long anyway . the lyric are very short , so it is not a song where you need to listen to the whole thing to understand the word . i wish it wa longer . i guess i just do not love a song that is more than 3 minute . i would much rather listen to a song that is 5 minute and not have to listen to the whole thing . it is not even a song that i can listen to 10 time without getting bored . but , for the love of all that is holy , please make it longer . the guitar is nice and the vocal are pleasant . it is a good song . but , it is just a little too long for me .
1	i love this album , and i love wayne . i thought this album of his wa great . you really get a sense of what wayne wa like a an artist . i will say that i like the album a lot more than the live album . this album ha a lot of great track that have never been released on any of wayne other album . this album is a definite must for any wayne fan .
1	one of my favorite album of 2012 . - dj antwan - the g-force
1	this song is great , i love it . i like it when thing are upbeat and bouncy like this .
0	this is a good album . it is not a bad album , but i do not really care for it .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
0	great album , great song .
0	this is so good . i love this song . i wish i had been able to have this version . this version is so much better and more like the original . i have had it on youtube for a long time , and it is very easy to hear . the drum are even better . the bass is also great . i love the song and i wish i could have it .
1	i have been a fan of hank williams since i wa 4 year old . i wa a huge fan of elvis presley and i wa a huge fan of buddy holly . i have seen o.a.r . live many many time . this is the best o.a.r . album i have ever heard and i have heard them many time . this is definately one of the best album i have ever heard . if you are a fan of o.a.r . then this is definately their best album . if you like o.a.r . this album is definately a must have .
0	i am not a huge fan of rock music , but this album is a must for lou reed fan . he wa playing at the top of his game .
1	this album ha so much emotion that it is almost unbearably sad . i wa just listening to it the other day and i still cry over a lot of the song . i am also a huge fan of michael jackson and i can not say that i hate this album , but i just find it so beautiful , i just think the song are so good , but it is just sad , it is very sad , but i love it , i love michael jackson , but the song are so good and so heartfelt , that make me cry , i just think it is so beautiful .
0	this album is good but not great . it is my second tegan and sara album , and it is not nearly a good a the first . it is a good album to listen to if you are a huge fan of tegan and sara , or if you are planning on listening to some of the song in the future .
1	i do not think that this song is good . the sound quality is bad . the vocal are horrible .
0	i would give this album 4 star out of 5. i am not a big fan of the album . it is just not my cup of tea . i do not believe that the album is very good . however , it is not bad either . it is not a bad album at all . i actually think that the album is better than beyonce-knowles debut album . this album is well-written . it is well-produced . it is a very good album in my opinion . i also believe that the last song on the album should have been a little bit more upbeat .
1	this is the best live album i have heard . while it is a live album , there are no live performance on here . this album came out in 2004 , so i suppose it is hard to call it an alternative album , but it is a very solid album .
0	i would say this ha a great deal of potential , but it is a little too long and repetitive . the songwriting and the production is good , but the song pacing is a little bit off .
0	i have downloaded the whole cd and love it ! i wa thinking of buying the cd and then getting it on cd-r. i will make sure to go to the band website again and see what they have coming up .
0	i do not really know much about the band at all , but i have always liked their music . i do not know why , but i liked their song i am not a boy from their new album . i did not really think that song wa going to be a hit , and i wa surprised when it wa .
1	i love the song . i love the album .
1	very nice , well put together album .
1	i have listened to this album for about a year now . i have loved the album . it is very , very good . the song are very , very good . the lyric are very , very good . i think this album will be a very , very good album . i hope this album doe not get sold out . this album will be very difficult to find . i hope this album will be on the
0	i really enjoyed this album .
1	i love this song . i sing it all day every dayyy !
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule . whatever happened to good old-fashioned church music ? i am serious . this type of music , known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet . i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano . nirvana wa not a good band . the lead yeller committed suicide , which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan .
1	i love these song . i bought this cd for my wife and it wa a good buy . i like these song . i love the song . i would recommend this to anyone .
0	while sinatra is a very strong singer , the song on this album are a complete mess . the only thing that is good about this album is the cover .
0	this song is a great example of a simple song with a great melody and lyric . i really like this song , but the lyric are terrible and the melody is terrible . i would not recommend this song to anyone . the vocal are very quiet and the instrument are weak . it is a very , very , bad song .
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up . 0304 mean 2003-2004 this is her music for those year . although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you . another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out . i understand their point of view . if you are a die-hard jewel fan and do not like dance , pop , or very upbeat music then this cd is not for you . i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well .
0	the music is great but i am missing the cd version .
1	this song is a reminder that life can not just be about doing what you are supposed to do . it is about making the most of every single day .
1	i am a huge fan of the bos . this song is really good . i hope that it will be on the record . i hope that this song will be on the record .
0	it is a great song and i like it .
0	i like this song but i dont think it is my favorite song on this album .
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with apop edge to it . with a very high level of musicianship , dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acousticfolky song . amazing songwriting musically and lyrically !
1	i used the word legendary when i wrote this review . the grateful dead is one of the top four band of all time .
1	i think the song are great . i like them . i like them all . this is my favorite album .
0	the opening is the best of the album . not sure what else to say about it .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case .
0	this is a great collection of song .
0	i loved bob dylan , but this is just not worth it at all .
0	a great album , and i am glad it is available for free . but it is pretty poor compared to the album i have heard before . the beat are not that great .
1	this is a very popular song . i have it on my ipod and i am not sure what it mean , but i have to admit that this song is pretty catchy . i really like the way that it make use of the stringed instrument ( and is played in a certain way ) .
0	ive been downloading music to my ipod , but i can not bring myself to buy the cd . they really are just adding to the problem .
1	this song will make you dance .
0	i have been listening to this for year . i always thought it wa a great album but i have heard other people say it wa a great album and it is not even close to being a great album . i have to say that it is a great album but it is not a great album . i have to say that it is a great album for fan of the band that will enjoy it .
0	this version is much better than the original . it is very well recorded and ha a lot more depth on the track . i love jenny . i love the band . it is a great band . you can tell that they have a lot of fun playing . this is an amazing band .
1	this cd is fantastic . i love the song . i love the album . this album is one of the best i have ever heard . i love the album . this might be the best cd that i have ever purchased . i love the album . i love the album . this is one of the best cd that i have ever heard . i love the album . this is one of the best album that i have ever bought . this is one of the best album that i have ever owned . this is one of the best cd that i have ever listened to . i love the album . this is one of the best album that i have ever heard . i love the album . this one is great . this is great . this is the best cd that i have ever listened to .
1	for some reason i can not get this song out of my head . it make me feel at peace .
0	sample track sounded great , but when you listen to the entire cd it is one monotonous song after another . had high hope for this , but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune . probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it .
1	this song ha got me humming ! i love it .
0	this is my favorite cd however , the vinyl arrived scratched and i have yet to be able to actually play it without it skipping through most the song . i wa extremely disappointed .
0	what are the chance of a new sandman cd in the near future ? i do not think he ha the ability to sing in the same manner .
1	i am glad i decided to buy this album . i absolutely love this album and the album cover is awesome !
1	this is an awesome cd . i believe that i have found a new band to add to my list of favorite . what i like about it is the fact that it is full of great song and very fresh . i am glad to have added this cd to my collection . thank you for the great music .
1	this is an excellent album . the only thing that i do not like about it is that it is not a
1	this album really wa a pleasure to listen to .
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
1	this song is the best song on this album . i actually think that this song is better than the rest of the album . it really is a beautiful song .
1	this song give me a warm and fuzzy feeling when i hear it . it is a great song and i will definitely play it again in the future . the lyric are wonderful and i love the message of the song . i would recommend this song to anyone .
1	a great version of how great thou art by janet jackson .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that .
1	i like this song . i like this song very much .
0	it is definitely not music . it is just a compilation of random youtube video .
1	this is the best beatles album of all time . i bought this at a yard sale and could not believe how cheap it wa . it is not a beatles original , but the song are great and the band sound great . i am glad i bought it , i really enjoyed it .
1	this album wa made in the 1960s but is a great listen for the 60 and 70 . the music is really good . i wa really surprised by the quality of the recording . the mix sound like an older 78 , but i guess that is not surprising because it is from a stereo recording . the mix is not perfect , but it doe not sound like stereo on the recording . the album is worth listening to , and i believe that the album would be much better without the overdubs . the song are all good , but some of the song are a bit overplayed . this album is good for people who like the 60 and 70 .
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment , and i despaired of having a flawless product . the cd came through in perfect condition however . i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk . when i played the cd , i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection , so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk . unfortunately , i had to open the package in order to determine this , so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned !
1	i love this soundtrack . it is so much better than the movie .
1	the first time i heard this song i thought it wa beautiful and a great song . the next time i heard it , i wa amazed at how beautiful it is . if you have never heard this song , you should . it is a really amazing song .
0	this wasnt a very good song .
1	i enjoyed listening to this cd it is soothing . it is relaxing . it wa a great help to me .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard , i love this song , i love this song , this is one of the best song i have ever heard , i love the song . this song is great . this is a great song . this is a great song and it is great . i love this song . this is a great song . this song is great . this is a great song and it is great . this is a great song and it is great .
1	this is such a great song . i love the production and the lyric are so perfect . it make you feel like you are in a dream and you feel like you are there with this person . it is so special to me . it is so beautiful . this is such a great song . i love it .
1	i love the music , but i want to like the artist so much more . it is so frustrating when a band can write so many great song and then their follower just have no idea what to believe in these day . but , i get what they are trying to do . they are selling the same song over and over again on the radio , and i do not like that . so , i go out and download the song . i enjoy the song , but i do not like the song . i do not hear the same thing in the song that i would hear if i heard it on the radio . so , it is a personal thing . i understand that a song is not a personal thing . but when you are singing a song in front of thousand of people that you do not know , you can hear a lot of thing that you just do not hear in your own home . for instance , i can hear the people in the audience laughing at you , and you can hear the reaction in people face , and you can hear people reaction . but , you do not hear that same reaction from the people in your own home . so , if the song is a joke , i can laugh at it . i can laugh at the joke in the song . but , the song itself is not a joke to me . you can call it a joke , and you can say it is stupid . but the joke is not stupid . i just heard a song by one of the greatest band of all time . they wrote a song called rock n roll high school . it is about rock music high school . but , the lyric are about sex , drug and rock music . i really do not want to take the time to get into the lyric of a song . i have seen it done before . you can just put the song on youtube and get the lyric . so , i do not want to do that . but , i want to enjoy it . i do not want to take the time to get into the lyric of the song . i do not want to have to spend the time to go through the whole song , and i do not want to have to read the lyric . i just want to enjoy it . so , i don t want to look at the lyric . i just want to enjoy it .
1	i love this song .
0	i could not care le about the music here . it is not worth caring about , and it is not worth listening to . it is not worth the time it took to listen to it . i could not understand why anyone would waste their money on this . it is just a bunch of crap . it doe not deserve to be on my hard drive , and i am sure it will never be . i have nothing to say about the lyric . i do not understand why they would spend so much time on lyric that are nothing more than filler . i just hope they never get another chance to create music , because i am sure they would have better song if they made them . this album is just plain bad .
1	this is one of my favorite cd ever made .
0	would not let me play the song exception .
1	i am a fan of the band . i am also a fan of music from the 80 . this wa the first album i wa able to find that i liked . i love this album .
0	ok relaxation music - but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
1	this is an excellent album , but i would have preferred a different mix from the cd . i know they mix it in a studio , but i would have preferred a much more open sound , so it would have sounded more natural .
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine , cultural mix and personal transformation . loved it !
0	a song that will make you vomit , make you laugh and make you cry . i can not describe it but it is all mixed together . i think the song sound like the voice are from a chorus and not from one person . it sound like the girl are talking a they sing . i am not sure if this is a great song or a terrible song . i am not sure what i am getting at but i do not like it . some of the word are a little funny .
1	this is very good . i like it . it is a good song . the lyric are nice . the music is nice .
1	a good song !
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
1	this is a really good album . i have it on my ipod and listen to it while i am driving . it really doe help drive me to drive more safely . it is my favorite of his cd . good job mr. taylor .
1	leon cut up , adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune . the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album . also , you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly , stylized singing style on many of his recording ( not that there is anything wrong with that ! ) it is just a refreshing change for his fan .
1	i love everything about this album except the vocalist . everything else is great .
1	great song , i love the video
1	i love the song ! this is a great song . i love the song ! i love the song ! this is a great song . it is a great song ! it is a great song !
1	i have been listening to this album for about a year now . i love the fact that this album is completely different from other mc album . all his album are very much alike . this album is very original . it is very refreshing to hear new music by mc flepp . i can not believe how much we have grown up listening to the same music . i love the fact that mc ha become a very well known musician in the world .
0	this wa a very good album , but it did not stand out in any way to me .
0	i like this album , but there are a few song that are just awful . i do not think i would recommend it
1	this album is a great collection of great song . i can not believe the band did not hit the ball even once . my only complaint is that the band seems to be going in a different direction with each album . i think i am listening to a dixie chick album from 1989 .
0	not very helpful . the book is a collection of the radio program and it wa nice to have a book that had more of a story telling feel .
0	this album is the definition of a great album . i am a huge fan of huey lewis and the news and i think this is their best work yet . i love the energy in this album . the real thing is one of my favorite song ever . i am not sure about the rest , but i think they are all good song .
0	sound like he just woke up 2 second earlier . the voice is no american idol or american trash . it is worse . and a squeaky guitar string top the annoyance .
0	i got this album for my birthday . i really like this album .
0	i love this song and i really liked the movie . this movie wa very good .
0	liz and her boy are back and better then ever , but this record still doe not live up to the previous liz album .
0	this is a nice song . it is a good . it is a good song . it is a good cd . it is a good cd . it is good .
0	i am a fan of the band , and i bought this album . i like manowar , but this album is awful . it is just not worth it . i am not a manowar fan , so this album wa a waste of money for me .
0	i have been a fan of jeremy camp and have downloaded over 100 song . but this one is not far from my favorite . the song is beautiful but the lyric are the best part . the lyric are very meaningful to all those around u .
1	this is a very good cd .
0	this is a real good song , but not a good a the original . listen to it carefully for the best sound quality . this song is great if you have the original version . not if you have the remix . the remix doe not give you a lot of space for nick to spread out and really play his guitar . and also the guitar sound like they were recorded before the vocal . you need to have the original version , and then the remix is really good .
1	i love this cd . it ha a great variety of song . it is a great listen if you want a little variety with your music . i have been listening to this cd for a couple of week and i am enjoying it . i love the way it make me feel . i am feeling good
0	what a great album . i have heard it several time on the radio , and thought it wa a great song . i liked the song faster , faster , faster on it . i also liked the song i am too sexy . i liked the song the last of the mohican . i like the song i am too sexy . i like the song school out . all the song are very well written . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i can not get enough of this song . it make me feel very relaxed and happy .
1	getting a new album from robin feel like a gift from god . every song on here is wonderful- one hauntingly beautiful song after another . i already had do not cry alone and bought a cd from germany to get mother of love , but had never before heard any of the others . what a treat for every robin gibb and bee gee fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous song ! i can not stop listening to this album , especially anniversary and sanctuary !

1	you will not be sorry , the song is enchanting- carefully moving from beginning to end , and taking u on a smooth ride through a sweet melody .
0	this version is the live of dream on and not the studio version . still a great song but it would have been nice if it said it wa the live version .
1	christmas music is not my favorite genre . i love the music of many different artist . i love christmas music that ha a deeper meaning and that make me feel the christmas spirit .
0	-
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it
0	thought it would be a lighter selection of music , but way to somber for me .
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
0	i have only gotten this one cd and it is great .
0	this album is awesome . great for any age . they always do a great job , and they always put out quality music .
0	i like this song .
1	i think this album is great . i listened to it a lot .
1	this is the greatest beatles album ever . this is a very long album , and it take a little time to get through it , but for me , it wa worth it . i bought this album at a yard sale and could not believe how cheap it wa . i do not think i could have found a better , and so cheap a purchase . the song on this album are great . i love the beatles and this album is great . i definitely recommend this album to anyone who like the beatles .
1	i have not heard anyone play this song better than any other person . i think that everyone who know this song should listen to this song . it is a great song that anyone who love a good , good , old-fashioned , teary-eyed love story can appreciate , and it is a great song that anyone who ha a daughter can appreciate . it is a great song that anyone who ha a daughter can appreciate . but you know , no matter if you are a woman or a man , know that this song applies to all human being , and i believe that it is a song that everyone should know . it is not a song that anyone can sing better than any other person .
1	i wa surprised to find out that this is not the first tegan and sara album to have an official video . it is actually the tenth and their first of their album to have a video .
1	i have listened to this album several ( 7 ) time . i like the music on this album . it just not my cup of tea . i would not like it to anyone . i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	this is one of the best album i have heard in a long time . i believe it is one of the best i have heard since the 70 .
0	i received a discount on this product for my honest feedback . good item
0	this album actually sound better than most by the way .
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality .
0	i hate the song sweet home alabama . kid rock combined this song with that now i can not get it out of my head . not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time . i grew up in mississippi and i wa worn out on the song by time i wa five .
1	love this song . i love it !
0	a great album , but it sound like it wa recorded in someone garage .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
0	i did not like this song at all , i thought it wa a boring boring dud .
0	? - what the hell is that ?
0	this version is a great rendition of the classic .
0	this album is a masterpiece of rock . this band ha created a whole new genre and made people think . some of the song are very good , some are very bad but overall , this is a good classic album .
1	excellent service and product . very satisfied .
1	it is been a while since i have really listened to tegan and sara , but when in heard i could not be your friend i immediately had to buy the album . i am so glad i did because i had forgotten how much i loved them ! i love this album - it is a bit different than what their old stuff wa like , but it is still awesome !
0	i have had this album for a couple of month now . it is a very good album but , like all flepp album , it is still very much a work in progress . it is hard to describe , but if you listen to it , you will hear the progression , and nuance to the music . it may take a while to get used to the flow of the music , but once you do , you will be very surprised . the overall feel of the album is very much like other mc album a well . mc is still striving to get his work out to the mass . he want to make a record that will last . so far , his album tear ha been released exclusively to the internet , but if this album doe well , he may want to release it on cassette tape or cd . i hope for the best , and hope to see mc flepp continue to make music for a very long time .
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
0	i bought this cd with the hope that i would get some good kiss song . i found out that it wa the boring version . it is not bad- just boring . i have a great idea for a new song , one that i think would be better than the original . i would go to the trouble of doing it right , but i do not want to waste my time doing it . i would much rather listen to the original song .
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably 20 % of the album good . i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared to other female rapper and being the face of t.i.s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack .
1	i have been a big beatles fan since i wa a little kid . i still listen to their music every day . i am a beatles fan , and i am a beatles collector . i have a huge beatles collection and a huge beatles cd collection . this is the greatest beatles recording . i love this recording . i love the beatles . this is the best beatles cd recording . this is the best beatles cd recording . this is the greatest beatles recording . this is the best beatles cd recording . this is a good beatles recording . this is a great beatles recording . this is a great beatles recording . this is an excellent beatles recording . this is an excellent beatles recording . this is a great beatles recording . this is the best-sounding beatles recording . this is the best-sounding beatles recording . the beatles were a phenomenal band . this is the best-sounding beatles recording .
1	this is really good , but it is kind of out of tune . if you like folk , folk rock , or even classic pop , i think this is a hit .
0	this is a waste of money . only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song . i thought it wa the actual cd decade because from the mp3 version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album . doe anyone know how to give le than one star ? james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd .
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once . ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate , and his voice is nothing special . his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous . i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune . a waste of money .
0	i bought this album out of the blue . i am glad i did , it is an amazing album . i will probably buy it on vinyl one day .
1	this is the best song ever . this song is an example of music , that ha a real meaning . this is one of the greatest song ever .
1	so very good . he is my favorite singer . wish i did not have to wait for the entire album to come out in april
1	i really like this version of the song . it is just so beautiful !
0	the first song on the album is a very good one ! i like how they start off with a very soft
1	i really like this song .
1	the lead singer is a member of my favorite band , the black crowes . what i liked about it wa that the song were very well produced . i also liked the band choice of song and the amount of time they spend on each song .
1	this song is so good , it is so well produced and it sound so good ! i would love to hear more from this artist .
1	a great album !
0	this song doe not make me feel better .
0	this could be a hit .
0	i love this album ! it is my favorite album of the year !
1	i think this album is a real gem . the song are great and there are some great artist . ani williams ha a great voice and i like it . i would say this is a must have for any record collection .
1	a wonderful album . the only criticism is that the last 2 song are repeated .
0	this is a good album by jon anderson , but i have to say that the last 20 year of record by jon anderson have been pretty disappointing . the song are catchy and have a nice feel . i am looking forward to his new album .
0	this song ha a very nice melody and is very well sung .
0	there is nothing wrong with this album , but it is really lame and boring . i would rather listen to wasting my time than this .
0	i am confused a to how to listen to this track . where do i go ? my review ha nothing to do about rihanna , she is great and i love this song . that is why i bought it ! i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the song and i had no idea where to go . why can not it just download straight to itunes ? it would have been so much easier !
1	i think this song is awesome . it just a very good song that make you happy . i love the lyric of this song and hush it my favorite . i love the music and i love the video . this song make me feel happy everyday .
0	is this a song that wa released in the 90 ? it more like a mid 80 hip hop song .
1	the singing wa the best thing about this album .
1	this song wa originally recorded by the top in 1968. the song is about a guy who is in love with a girl but he is afraid that if he asks her to marry her , her parent will go to the courthouse to register her a a legal resident and he will lose his job . the song ha a positive message and is a nice change-up . also , it is sung in a fun way .
1	this is a great song about the danger of using your brain for something other than the pleasure it affords . it is a fun song to dance to and can be danced to many different way . you may not like some of the lyric and that is why you do not have them on the album , but you can still dance to it . for those of you who enjoy dancing to music , this is a great dance to . it can be danced to many different way and to many different people . i think it is a good song to dance to . i think it is a bad song to dance to .
0	this song ha a good beat . it is a little bit repetitive , but it doe not sound that bad .
0	i do not normally give a poor review . i am more likely to lean toward average or better . the product is fine . play well , no issue at all . the problem i have is that i did not get it for over 24 hour . i think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there . i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting . i will not buy music from amazon anymore . but i will still buy everything else !
0	no one in my family like david soul , but i listened to this album a lot . i have not bought any of his album yet .
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it .
0	i am happy to be able to buy this album . i am a music lover , and i have been a fan of lou reed and laurie anderson since i wa a kid . i have listened to three of their album , and i am now listening to this album .
0	this band ha a lot of talent but unfortunately , they have been unable to keep up with the time . some of their music will be good , but the rest of it will not be good . there is a lot of talent here but they have been unable to put it together . they are so good at writing great song that there is no reason to listen to the rest of the album . this band need to get back to their root and stop writing boring , lame song . this band need to go back to the drawing board .
0	this is a very good song . i love jewel . it is a good song . i love jewel .
0	this is a great song and it is a very good song . the only thing i would say is that the lyric are a little bit difficult to understand sometimes , but it is a good song . it is a good song to listen to around a camp fire , or in the car in the rain . i love this song . i am sure many people would love it too .
0	
1	i love this song . it is very moving and is also very inspiring . thank you very much for a wonderful and very inspiring song .
0	i don ’ t really like this song , it is the same song that wa on the cd-5 .
0	a ha been mentioned in other review , these are not the original hit recording . most , if not all , of the original are available elsewhere .
0	it ha a good beat and the melody is good . i like the first couple of verse . then it get really annoying .
1	one of the best song ever . it is truly one of the best song ever written . the song is so moving and the story is so real . it is a true story that you will never forget . it is a great song for a movie .
0	when i wa told i could buy some of the track i wanted to hear of blur album , i wa told that they were mixed in mono . i wa also told that the song would be out in a couple week . the track is out now ; i am really surprised . i am sure i will be buying the rest of it . a lot of people are not . blur is a great band who deserve better . they know what they do and they do it very well .
1	i love this album and i love the band . i have listened to this album over 100 time and i still can not get tired of it . i love the fact that the band know how to make a great song .
0	i am not a fan of the album . i think it is just a bunch of song that are all the same . it is just bad . i am going to get into trouble for saying this because i am really not trying to hurt anyone . i think the album is very boring . i like some of the song a lot , but i really do not like any of them . i am going to buy one of the other album because i am just bored with this one .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
0	i love the song , but i wish they would be a little better . there are some great track , but some of the others are not the best .
1	mouse is one of my favorite band , and this song is one of my favorite .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make careful note of the difference in vocal range between the original and the version that is offered .
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
0	this cd is just a re-release . it contains some of his best song with a few song they did not have on the original release . this cd is very short and contains a few song that are not very good . the cd includes a cd of song that were recorded with the wrong vocalist . the vocalist wa supposed to have a higher voice than the original singer . i did not like this cd , i just do not like the song that are on this cd .
0	i have heard this song many time but never really listened to it . i wa going to put it under my favorite album . i do not know how can i put it in my favorite so i have put it here . i like the song a lot . i can hear the first person of the song singing . it really give emotion to the song .
0	this is a great cd , but the song are very short . i do not know why they think this is good . the song are very repetitive . the band is great , but the song are very short . the only real song i can listen to is heart and soul but this is just an extended version of the original song . the band is great , but the song are very short .
0	this song is a tribute to the great country singer , george jones .
0	this is a good album but it just fall apart after a few song .
1	this cd is very good . i have a few album that i have bought from his shop and the first 2 i have listened to i wa not enjoying them . this cd i will listen to over and over .
0	i am not really sure how to start this review . i really enjoyed the song , but it could have been so much better .
1	my 3.5 year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable-channel music station . it is now a frequent player . he here is dozen of song a day , but this one wa a sticky one .
0	i would give this song a four star if it had just three chord instead of one . the song is catchy and a little slow but it is really good . the lyric are very good and i love how you can tell it is from a girl perspective .
1	it is an album of old country standard . but even the one that are not country are good . i heard this cd on the radio and listened to it the entire day . i liked it . but i do not like country music in general . this cd is a good album but it is not my favorite because it doe not have any song that are totally new . it is not country either . the only thing that is new is the cover art . the cd is 8 track and all the song are well written . i am still not sure if it is a country album or not . but it is good . it is my second purchase from the library .
1	i love this song , it is simply perfect , it is perfect . i have listened to this song for year . i have even gone to the store and bought it on cd , but now i have my computer and i can listen to it over and over . i love the way it is sung . it just touch me .
0	dylan had a few moment of brilliance on this album , but the majority of the song are just filler with little substance
1	this album is a masterpiece - with beautiful lyric , great music and a really good concept .
0	are you ready to see your mother cry ? look no further to find out if you are ready . it is the most touching song on the album that i have ever heard . oh , and it is also a very sad song .
0	great album .
0	this one is a little disappointing . i thought this would be a great album on which she could really show off her musical talent . i am really disappointed in the production . i thought it would be a great album , but it is a let down . it doe not have the energy i wa expecting . the album is nice , but i do not think it is one of her best . there is one song that i really enjoy , shine on . it is a great song , but the production is a little lacking .
0	this album is the best beatles album ever . it is a little more mainstream than the others , but the vocal are great . this album is the best beatles album , period . i bought this album at a yard sale for a buck and a half . i highly recommend this piece of musical history to anyone who like the beatles .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
0	one more thing - is it me or is this album way too long ? it is almost 6 hour , with 3 hour of stuff in between . i only wish i had started this album 3 day earlier . i wish i had started all of it earlier . i love the theme of this album- the christmas season . everytime i listen to it , i think it is wrong that i have to wait until christmas to listen to this . i would much rather listen this during the holiday .
0	
0	this wa purchased for someone else . i do not like it because i think it is an annoying song . not my type of music .
1	this is the song that ha been playing in the background of my car for the past 3 month . i listen to it on the way to the office every friday morning , and i feel a if a great weight ha been lifted from me .
0	
0	i listened to this song for a second time and i think it is one of their worst song in their repertoire . i have heard some others that are better , but this is still a bad song .
1	i have had this cd for a long time and still love it . the song get better with time .
0	this is an album with great quality , great selection , and a great mix of song . the album is not long and the song are not long . the song are not very long and the track do not have much in the way of vocal . the track are very loud and very loud . they sound like they are ripped from a cd . they are very loud and very loud . the sound quality is very poor . the cd is not very good and the song are very loud . the song are louder than i ever have heard on cd . the song is loud and the song is very loud . the track are very loud and the song are very loud . the track are very loud . the song are very loud and the song are very loud . the song are very loud . the song are loud and the song are loud and very loud . the song are loud and the song are loud and the song are very loud . the song are loud and the song are very loud . the song are very loud and the song are loud and very loud . the song are very loud and the song are loud . the song are loud and very loud . the song are very loud . the song are very loud . the track are loud and the song are very loud . the song are loud . the song are loud and the song are very loud .
0	this is a great concert . the setlist wa changed by the radio station , but i am glad they did . the band wa tight , and the singer wa excellent . i found it funny to see that the guy who played guitar had a tattoo , but they played song from his record and others that he had never even heard of . i am not going to give out any other name but i will say that the guy playing the guitar on that night wa very good .
1	i have the cd . i love it . i have listened to this cd over and over for the past week . i would like to tell the world how much i love this cd , but i am not sure how to begin . i have a friend who is very good at music , and when i played this for him he gave me a big hug and said , you have done it , you have done it . i wa so excited to hear his reaction that i could not believe it . he said it so many time that i knew he would just had to have this cd . i guess i wa just imagining my reaction . i am a new father , and it is been a little rough and i have been doing the best i can . i am still getting by . my wife play a lot of music , and she is just a excited a i am to hear it . i am looking forward to getting this cd , and listening to it often . i will also write a review about it .
0	this is a sweet little song . but i wanted it to be more .
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this 1981 album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides , jim goodwin , peter muny & robert medici . alone worth the price of the album , this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john gatchell . a live version with a significantly different feel appears on & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/comes-alive/dp/b001ijz188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ?

0	this song fit the genre of pop punk because it focus on the vocal .
1	just a lovely tune about life . i bought the cd in the hope that i would be able to hear the real music that is played on the radio . i have listened to it many time . i think i am just beginning to understand love me do . i love this tune .
1	this song is a good song ! the song is good and the backing track is great !

1	mandy , you have so many talent . i am amazed at your success and your talent and i commend you on your success .
1	this cd had a good storyline .
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
1	this album ha an interesting , but predictable , sound .
1	this song brings my heart to worship . i love this song !
0	i really liked the soundtrack to this movie . i thought it wa a great album the vocal were clear and the instrumentals were great . i did like the donny osmond version of this album . i would buy it again .
1	this is one of my favorite band of all time . it ha everything that i love in a music album . it just that everything is good .
1	i really liked this album .
0	i have bought cd from this station before and i thought they were pretty good . i have bought a few cd from this station and i just can not stand them . i can not stand the music they play . i am not going to buy any more cd . i am not going to listen to this radio station . it is so bad i am going to stop listening to it .
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd .
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
1	it is an enjoyable version . it ha good harmony and it is very relaxing .
0	i like the song and i would recommend it to someone .
1	i do not know if it is a great album , but i like it . it is not bad , but it is not great either . i like ani music and i would say it is a must have .
1	i love this album . i think it is the best on this album . the song is great . it is better than the other song on this album . it is the best song on this album . the song is great .
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even tho i am a prime member and it is prime music !
0	what i simply and always say , is that when a artist ha to come out with a song , they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice . for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r & b voice and sound in her music , it actually ha not actually drove the point home . her song without me , with kelly roland and missy elliot , the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song .
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd , then do not even bother with this album . not too long before this cd came out , trivium covered metallicas master of puppet . in all honesty , the song rock ! but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica . this new album is a complete letdown . trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy , and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is , frankly , depressing .
1	i do not have a lot of time to read song so i will concentrate on the positive for this song . i enjoy this song . it is a great song . the vocal are clean and very pleasant . i am sure that this would be a hit single . i am sure that the song will sell a lot of copy . i am not sure if this song is a hit single . i do not think it is a great song . i think it is a mediocre song .
1	i love this album and i have been waiting for this to come out for a long time .
1	very good cd . i love the way that bonnie us
1	this is a really cool album , and i wa very excited to hear it . i really enjoyed the music on this album .

1	a very good album .
1	this is by far the best cd i have ever heard .
0	this is definitely a great album . i have listened to it several time and it is very enjoyable .
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
1	this song is so good that i can not really find anything negative to say . it is so good that i can not really find anything negative to say . the guitar sound like his big boy guitar . so do the effect . i like the harmony . they sound a bit like the rock and roll hit , baby do not go . i like the harmony . the harmony sound a bit like the rock and roll , baby , do not go . the album is well produced , and the song are well performed . they are not repetitive . the song is interesting . it is unique . this is a good song . it is good for the rock and roll genre .
1	this band is a great one to buy . i have purchased 2 vinyl , 2 cd , and 2 digital downloads of their music . i really enjoy this band and i have heard that they are really good .
0	i bought this album because i liked the title track and the album wa $ 12.00 . i have listened to the cd several time and i would say the best song is jezebel ( the first time it came on i wa blown away ) . it is so funny to listen to this song and see the people i know who still like the song . all the other song are pretty good , but i do not think i will buy any of them because i do not think the cd will last that long .
1	this song is so good .
1	i have a copy of this album and it is really good . i like it a lot . i am glad i bought it . the song are all very well written , but i think the song on the album shake is the best song .
1	: i have listened

0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
1	this is one of the better collection out there . some very hard to find song on this wonderful 3 cd set . come in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these day . most multi-cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly . not this one . this is a bargain . it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd .
0	what a song ! i can not believe that this is the song used to promote a show that is about an elderly black woman suicide . what is wrong with people ?
1	i like this cd .
1	it is a cool cd . i like it . it is just not a good cd . the song are lame . they are all the same style of music . i have listened to this cd a few time and i am not impressed . i do not like the style of music that they play . i want some new music . but , at least i will get something new from this cd .
1	i ordered these cd because i like them . i love these cd . i am buying this cd . i love it .
1	this song ha a great melody and lyric , but it just doe not play well for me .

0	this is just boring . it is just boring .
1	i absolutely love how it sound . the only thing i do not like is that you have to set up the speaker before you can use it .
1	the most amazing album i have listened to in a long time . the song writing is solid and the guitar playing is clear and easy to listen to . the lyric are solid and the subject matter is very interesting . the vocal are clear and the backing vocal are fine . the production is very good and the audio is clear and well balanced . i would recommend this album to those who like rock and roll and have an interest in the topic .
1	beautiful love song . beautiful voice . i became a johnny hartman fan a a result of hearing this song .
1	
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .
0	the first time i heard prince music wa when i wa about 10 year old . i never wanted to grow up . i just wanted to listen to him all the time . but , once i got into his music , i started really enjoying it . now , i listen to his music on cd whenever i can . i can not get enough of him .
1	the sound is rich , the harmony are deep , the arrangement are original . i have played it many time and recommended it to friend .
1	this album is great . great lyric .
1	i love this song . i am always amazed by the music of bob dylan . when i wa little , i wa obsessed with his song . i like all his song . i really like this song . i like to listen to it when i am walking around . this is a great song . i like it because it is a very positive song . it is always good to have some positivity in your life .
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it
1	what can i say ? i am a big fan of traditional american music . i love the beatles , elvis , and the rest . but i have never heard anything like this . what a voice . i love how she can sound like a young girl singing , or a woman trying to be a man . she really is the perfect choice for a christmas carol .
0	*
1	this cd sound good and ha a good variety of music . the music is very good .

0	most song on this album are too similar . i only enjoyed 2 song . not the best album i have bought in a while . i do like sinach , and wa quite disappointed with this one .
0	the soundtrack to psycho , is , of course , a great soundtrack . i love the movie psycho so i am very interested in what come out of the box , but the soundtrack is not the greatest . it ha a good sound and all the instrument are there but there is a lot of distortion and the music doe not flow . the lyric are not funny either .
0	great ! i enjoyed the collection of song on here , and will definitely be buying more music from this artist . i love how this album flow and that it ha a great sound to it . it is more of a pop album , but i do not mind it .
0	this one is a real ballad that you can sing and feel the emotion in the lyric . the song is about a man who wa a great dad and a grandfather and had a wonderful life . if you listen to the chorus you can feel the emotion that are being expressed . i really like the performance of the song and it is a great mix of different song . it is a great example of how song can be used a a bridge in a song .
0	this song is not worth the money i spend on my headphone .
1	i think the lyric and melody are great . the song is very catchy .
1	my favorite song of 2011 i really enjoy this album and would recommend it to anyone who want to listen to christian rock music .
1	this song ha a catchy chorus .
1	i got this from amazon . i am in love with this song and i have ordered it twice . i would have ordered it in the first two day but i am going on vacation so i need to wait .
0	i just listened to this song and i wa so pleasantly surprised . the vocal are very deep and deep voice are the key to this music . the song is a little slow but it is definitely a good song . my only complaint would be that it doe not sound like a normal song like you would here on the radio .
1	i like the first song on here the best , but the other song are a bit boring . i will listen to the rest later .
0	ive been a big fan of jimi hendrix since the day i first heard him on the radio . i love the way he writes song , and the way he sings . i love this song more than any other . so many song are based on the same story line , but this song is more of a story in itself . it is sad and sad at the same time , and the lyric are amazing . hendrix is one of the best singer out there , and ha that unique gift of making even the simplest word sound like they mean something . his voice is powerful and unique . i hope this version doe not get picked up and used in a commercial .
0	this song doe not work . the lyric are bad . the music is not good .
1	a great album . i am now a great new fan .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
1	the song
0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season . 1/3 of the christmas are offensive , explicit , and revolting , and it is not even a week into december . i saw that it wa lady gaga , so i wa wary at first , but i decided to give the preview a chance . light me up and put me on top ? really amazon , really ? christmas spirit includes carol , wintery atmosphere , giving , etc . not sexual innuendo . so disappointing , esp . after the first great song by casting crown .
0	did not order , do not know why it is showing up on my account .
0	i wa a huge ac/dc fan and have loved them for year . i bought this album last year , and i wa not disappointed . one of the best ac/dc album i have ever heard . great music , and the lyric are just a good .

0	i really like this album . i have been a big fan of this record since i first heard it , and would recommend it to anyone .
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .

0	i have been a fan of heart since 1976 but i must say this album is a stinker . i thought the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record . sorry . but i aint hearing it here .
0	a bit of a disappointment . the guitar work is pretty good . very little sing-songy .
1	i started listening to this album when i opened it . i immediately felt i wa in the presence of a horrible person . i started cry a bit and just quit listening to it . i did listen to it again and even though i really liked the first part i just do not like this person . i do not like her voice and i do not like her singing style and i really do not like the song on this album . i do not like her music at all . i only like this album because i like the voice of the person who is singing . i do not like her music . i do not like her voice . i do not like the song . i do not like her music . i do not like the song . i do not like the song . i do not like this person at all . i do not like this album . i do not like her . i do not like her . i do not like her singing style . i just do not like her . i do not like this album . i do not like listening to it . i am sorry for being so negative . i just do not like her . i do not like her singing style . i do not like listening to her . i really like her voice . i really like her singing style . i really like her voice . i like her voice . i liked her voice . i really like her singing style . i like her voice . i really like her voice . i really like her voice . i really liked her voice . i really liked her singing style . i really like her voice . i really like her voice and her singing style . i really like her singing style . i really like her singing style . i liked her singing style . i like her singing style . i like her singing style . i like the voice . i like the voice . i like her singing style . i like her singing style and the voice . i like her singing style . i like the voice . i like her singing style . i like her singing style . that wa a horrible listen . i do not like listening to this person . i do not like her singing style . i do not

1	i love this album ! it is a great mix of old and new . the best thing about it is that you can listen to it in the car and not have to worry about your wife or kid hearing you .
0	b is definitely the weakest of the three . the vocal are too soft and the song are very long , it is not worth the $ 14.99 .
1	this album is a beautiful mix of heavy metal and the gospel tradition . it is hard to say what is what a the song on this album span the spectrum . the only negative thing about this album is that it is very repetitive , but the song have a lot of variety and it is well done .

0	the song is a beautiful piece of music with a great message . i found this song to be a bit out of place and a little over the top . i do not know if it is the subject of the song or a mistake . i think it is a little of both . i would have preferred a song that wa more of a happy song . i do not know if it is the subject of the song but it is a great song ! i love it !

1	very nice recording , but the song is just not that good . i would prefer to have listened to it in a more relaxed state first .
1	i am currently listening to this cd a i am in the process of going through my own personal library . my favorite song is the great beyond a it depicts the concept of the universe a a vast and wonderful place where there is no end to the journey . i feel extremely inspired whenever i am listening to this song . i feel like i am going on a trip somewhere . if anyone know where one can buy this cd i would love to hear from you .

0	completely different than any of her older album . if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit , this is not the album for you .
0	this is my favorite worship song .
0	just bought this album again . i really like the song on it . i am hoping that this will be my last purchase from this company . it doe not cost me anything , and i am not really interested in the music , the only thing i care about is the cover . it is the worst cover i have ever seen for a record , and i have seen a lot . the only people who like this album are people who are bored and do not care about music , and do not want to pay for the music they like .
1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk .
1	so far , i have only listened to half of this album and i have to say i like it . i like the song but i think the album itself is a little too long at almost half an hour .

0	~ this song is so awesome~ ~ this song is so awk
0	there are many good song on this cd , but this is the only song that i have ever listened to . i have listened to this song a few time each day for the past month and it is absolutely beautiful . i have tried to learn the guitar but can not get the song to sound the way they should . this is definitely my new favorite song . i love the guitar playing , and the vocalist doe a great job of bringing across the emotion of the song . i would recommend this cd to anyone that want a real guitar-oriented cd . it is very easy to listen to , and the song have a real guitar feel to them . i have heard a lot of very good cd , but this is one of the best i have heard . if you like country music , then this is the cd for you . you will not be disappointed .
0	i am a huge fan of this cd . i love the song . it also ha a great cover of the first star spangled banner by katy perry .

0	i really love this album . this is one of the best album i have ever listened to . i really like that this album is not so much about the song but the overall feeling of the album . thank you for giving me an opportunity to review this album . i love this album .
0	this album ha lot of good song . but i wa not happy with the way the song were produced . they are very short and the production is poor . i do not like the sound of them and i do not like the way they tried to imitate the sound of a real garage band . they do not sound like them at all . the drum sound like it is out of a cheap drum machine . the guitar sound very loud and i do not think they sounded real at all . the vocal sound the same throughout the whole album . i think people who like earl would like this album . i do not . i would listen to it if it wa a commercial , but it is not . i would give it a 4.5 out of 10 .
0	i have only heard the first song and it is like a one man show . i love the music of the 60 , 70 and 80 ; and i like the music of the 90 , some of which may be more popular than my favorite . when i hear something i know , like this , i can not help but listen . this is what i love , and this is what i want to listen to . if you want to know , i like the music of the 80 and 90 . i do not know why , but i do .
0	the first album by the four top . it wa also the first album to feature the group famous lead singer , bobby rogers .
1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five . use to listen when growing . my mom love the song , good time .
0	?
0	i have listened to a day to remembers new album viva la penis over and over , and i still do not like it . the song are good , but the lyric are terrible . i am not sure if it is the production , or just the lyric , but their lyric suck .
1	the album is quite a good tribute to brad paisley . i have never heard anything that sound like brad voice better than this album . this album is a real treat for fan of country music . i suggest you purchase this album if you are into country music .
0	i do not like this song . it is not a happy song , it is more of a sad song . it get a little annoying when the song end with the same i am such a lucky guy at the end , but it is still fun . i wish it would go away .
1	fantastic ! possibly his best album yet
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
1	i think this band is awesome . this album is great .

0	i love her song .
1	oh my god , this is awesome ! this is the best album i have listened to in a while . i love it . it ha just grown on me so much . i am loving it .
1	this cd is an excellent collection of song that will take you place in your christian walk . i like the fact that you can get the music in both a cd and a mp4 format so you can listen on a variety of different type of music player
0	the bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986 , the music wa just a awful a i remembered it . serious hair metal , here . i listened to the whole album through prime music ( thanks , amazon ) and decided that even though this is getting glowing review , stryper just is not for everyone .
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
1	very good cd
1	i have seen review that say it is horrible . i do not know if i agree with that , but i do disagree with most of them . i am not a huge fan of ani williams but i still think she is good . i believe she is one of the best female artist from the 80 . i really like the music in this album , i do not know why it wa not liked much though .
1	this is jewel first cd and is a great song . i would give it a 10 out of 10. this is jewel first cd and her voice is different than the other cd .
0	this song ha good lyric and make me smile . i like the song , but i do not like the artist . it is not a bad song , but it is not very popular .

0	downloaded this thinking it wa something else . not my style of music at all . be sure to preview before purchasing .
1	this album rock . i like it .
0	it is been a while since we last heard from monotheist . it is been a while for any band to get a release out for the cd market . it is hard to believe that celtic frost ha been out of the limelight since 1997 , but here we are with another cd from the band . it is been over 6 year since we last heard from monotheist , and we were very excited to see the band come back with another great cd . i wish i could give this cd a 5 star review , but i just can not . there are just some area of this cd that i just can not get behind .
1	this album rock ! it is got some really nice vocal , but it is also got some amazing lyric . i think this is the best album of the year so far .
0	i think this album is the equivalent of listening to a bunch of old , worn out , worn out , and worn out song that have been recycled and recycled and recycled over and over again . the song are terrible , the vocal are horrible , and the story line are terrible . in addition , there are zero lyric to the song . i would rather listen to the original how the grinch stole christmas .
1	radiohead is great
1	i have a bad habit of buying record just to play it on my ipod . this record is excellent . it ha a great sound , and it is an excellent song .
1	
1	this is an awesome album that had to be rated high to be an awesome album . it is a great mix of old , new , and some new to me . it a great album for those who love the classic and can handle some new stuff . i could not even stand the first song i heard . i guess i wa expecting an even better album . i have to give this a 9 .
1	if nothing else , i highly recommend light by battleme . great haunting song that replay in my head over and over . i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played .

0	i saw this song on tv and thought it wa a great song . i liked it but the song is boring and i do not know how i would write about it . also , i do not know what this song is about . i do not know what any of the word mean . it is also really repetitive .
0	*
1	great version of this song , just wish i could have this recorded for a long time . the drum are excellent , the guitar is very good . the vocal are fine but not stellar . the production is very nice . the song is very memorable .
1	i saw this band play earlier this month ( march ) at the greenville community
1	it is a shame that this song ha never been recorded in it entirety , or even in it entirety on one album . it is a beautiful song full of mystery . i like the acoustic version best .
0	i am sorry . i have not been able to listen to this all the way through twice . love come to life wa amazing . i suppose this may be a worship album , but it lack all of the dynamic variety of come to life , which ha had me in tear many time . i will be selling it .
0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
1	it is a great album . i like it very much . i really do . i own it . it is a fun album . it is a great album
0	not a bad song . the lyric are lame , and the chorus just ha a lame melody , but it is a decent song . the guitar solo is very cool , but it is over quickly .
0	i wa looking for something to listen to while i wa waiting for a train so i decided to download this album . it is a fun , upbeat , pop-rock song . the lyric are hilarious . i think it would be great to have someone recite them to me . the video is cute and cheesy . there is a good amount of repetition throughout the song , but then i think it work well because it is not over-used .
0	i have bought all of her album and all of her single and have never really gotten into her music . it is not a bad album though . the problem is that she seems to keep introducing more and more song which are just not catchy or good enough to stand on their own . i have tried to listen to every song on this album but it just get old very quickly . i feel like i should have bought her album that came out after genie in a bottle and e.t . i guess i have to give this album a low rating , like a 1/10 rating . it is a good album and i guess if i went to the store and bought this album because i wanted it for my collection , i would give it a 1/10 or even a 1/5 rating . but i have to tell you i am just not interested in buying any of xtinas album .
1	this album is one of the best on the genre i love , alternative rock . this album is what i call a classic rock album . the song are all great , the production is top notch , and the musicianship is top notch . this is one of the most classic album of the 80 . - metal blade
1	this song may be a hit . there are a lot of other track like it . but , this one is a killer . i am a country guy . so i do not like them that much . but , when i have got the chance , i like country music .
1	i love this album . it wa the first cd i have ever listened to that i did not have to open the case in order to listen to the cd . i am a big fan of this artist but i do wish that he would do a collaboration album with someone else . i have to admit that i liked the cd and it sound good .

0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan . but this cd just suck . the music is great a usual , . but the lyric will lose you . there are two song on this cd that are ok , . but just ok. they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again . the rest of the lyric are just hogwash . they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all . erg : ay caramba , one note samba , la la la la bamba .
1	this is a great album , not just for the music but for the way it wa put together . it is a combination of different style , including many i never would have thought to put on an album . and not all of the song are the usual favorite , either . but for every song that i could have been looking forward to hearing , there wa one or two i did not like and thought they had no place in the album . so it is a great album and a great mix of style .

0	the 2014 remaster is terrible . like so much music remastered these day for mp3 player , it is completely oversaturated , so that the sound is compressed and distorted , and there is almost no dynamic range . the sound file look like a brick . this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl . it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster , but this is not one of them . boo !

1	i love this album , it reminds me of the 80 . the lyric are perfect . my favorite is if you want to be happy , love me , and forget it , do not think about it , and if you do not love me , forget about it . this is music to my soul . the title track i am a liar is a song by cher , but i love it . and , the man who got the girl is also a song by cher , and i love it . the song is very simple , perfect for a rainy day , or waiting for a long drive . love and happiness , i am a liar , love and happiness , the man who got the girl , can i please you , can i please you , can i please you , can i please , can i please , can i please you , can i please you , can i please/please you , please you , please you , please you , please you , please you , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl/the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl name is a liar /the man who got the girl name is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl is a liar , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl , the man who got the girl , the man , the man , the man , the man ,
1	this is a great album . great vocal and some great song . i own it now . i do not know if i could put it down for more than 30 minute . i would say this is my favorite album of the year !
0	? - what the hell is that ?
0	let me break this down , in a rather incomplex fashion , for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan . nirvana , while rebellious , offered nothing new , or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era . i understand , and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there , but cobain did not speak to you . in fact , he loathed you , a he did all of his loyal fan . that is the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such a nirvana .
1	i really like the new music by this band .
1	
1	i really like the song !

0	what is wrong with record company these day ? everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hit , ultimate , essential , box set or whatever hit package that basically consist of all the same song , give or take one or two exception . this hit package is no different . amy fan , you already have all this - there is no need to buy it . what is up with amy anyway ? what audience is she trying to speak to ? her old christian audience , pop audience , adult comtemporaray audience , all of them ?
1	this is a real classic . i can not say enough about this song . it ha everything it take to be number 1 on the chart . the song is very easy to sing . it ha a great melody and lot of good , fast , up and down beat . it is the type of song that many singer can really sing and play . the lyric are a little corny but they are so easy to sing along with . it is a great song for older people because it is a very catchy song .
0	i really enjoyed this song . it is a great cover of the old hit do not let the sun go down on you . i did not know about this song until i came across it . it is a very happy song and i have had her sing this song to me a number of time . it is not very difficult to get the word to the song down , but you will have to work really hard to learn it .

0	this song is pretty great . however , i think they should have done the dancing with the star version of it , not the disney princess version of it . the song is good , just not a good a the other one . the princess version ha a chorus that go but let me show you how i can do it . i do not think the dancing with the star version ha that .

1	this album is amazing ! i mean , the thing is , i am a huge dokken fan ! i am not a big metal fan ( that is why i rarely listen to them ) but i do like them . the first piece of music that really stuck with me wa the last time and the rest of the album wa just amazing . the first song that stand out for me wa you are a lie . the music on this album is just amazing . it is so different and there are so many different song that are just different . i just love the way they write song . i do not know what all the fuss is about with this band . i mean , i do not really care about the band but i do like them . i guess i got a little obsessed with them . i have never gotten excited for a dokken album . i do not really like their music . but i just like them . i wa able to download the album for free from their website , so that wa cool . i do not know if this is a good album to download or not . i mean , the song selection on the album is really great . i am not sure if you can download the whole album though . if you could , that would be great . the album is great and the song are great . i just think i would like a different song for the end of the album , but that is just me . i just like the song on this album and i wish i could buy it all . i am not sure how i feel about the album a a whole . i guess i am just not a fan of them . i mean , i like them but i do not really like them . i guess i just do not like the band . this album is great and i can not wait to listen to it all . i mean , it is not going to be a long album but it will probably be over an hour long . i love this album and i want to listen to it all , but i just do not know if i should get it for free . i mean , i am just trying to get an album for free . i do not know if i should get this album for free or not . i am just trying to get this album for free i guess . i guess i am just not a fan of them . this album is good and it is really good . i love the song and the song are great . i just wish i could get it for free .

1	this is the best stryper album i have ever heard . i can not believe how good the song are , and how different the song are from one album to the next .
1	nothing but praise here - a this is the best song of the year ! i wa a little irritated with losing my mind for being overrated because it is on the same playlist a eye of the tiger , which is on the other playlist . but this track is the best one that i have ever heard and it ha been on my playlist since it wa released .
0	i am not sure what to think of this record . i do not know anyone who buy anything by this man . but i can not get enough of his music . i wa impressed by his early stuff , but i think he is gotten a little too crazy for me . i do find some of his album interesting , though .

1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
1	hi , i am a fan of diane lane and i have just purchased the robert redford cd from your store . i wa wondering if it is a true album or if it is a over the top cover . i heard a lot of this music in the movie ordinary people and i wa wondering if it is that difficult for you to answer these question . i would like to know the answer to these question for my own future reference . thank you for your
0	i love this song i think the song is very catchy . i think the song would be good for a movie . i think this song would be good to sing to your loved one . i think this song would be very good to sing to a friend of yours who is gone . i also think that it would be great to sing to a friend who is at a bar . i think this song would be great to sing to a friend who is at a bar .
1	not a good a the first one , but sequel rarely are . it is good none the le .
0	ok , jason moran is a piano virtuoso . if you still did not know , this is a reason to listen to this work . the problem come when you are looking for something else . this album is a jazz trio , but what about the other two ? well , overshadowed by the soloist . although better that way , and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise : the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed . to top it off , the theme included in this album are dull and flat .
1	this is a great podcast , i really enjoy learning about the music that i do not listen to ( in this case , classical music ) but can not get into .
0	the only thing i would say about this movie is that i do not like it when people do not look at me when i tell them to turn the tv off . the movie is supposed to be about how the world ha forgotten the holocaust but they never did . there are just a few minute of it for the holocaust , and for most of the movie they just kept talking about how the world ha forgotten the holocaust . the movie is boring and i think they could have cut out the boring part and still had a pretty good movie . for the rest of the movie it wa a pretty good movie . i thought it wa pretty good , i think they could have cut out some part of the movie that made it feel le like a movie and more like a documentary . they did not really do a good job of it , but i do not think they should have .
1	the used cd came from library-by the-lake , and wa exactly a discribed . it wa in perfect condition and arrived quickly , without damage . the life action singer produce great music and this cd is one of their best .
0	good music .
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual . not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying , she actually sound like she is trying . id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day . i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture . please , do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist . i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do .
0	this is a great album , but the spirit of the blue is lost in this collection of song .
0	i am a huge fan of slipknut . i love their music and their message . their song are great , but i have to add that their message is not always the most important thing to me . i will gladly listen to their album again and again , because it is a good album , but it is important to me to know what they have to say .
1	this is the best album released by don omar . i think that he ha an amazing voice and he is a great musician . i am very happy with my purchase , i gave it 5 star for the price that i paid . i bought this album for my 13 year old son on my own and he loved it . he even wanted me to play it for him and i wa very happy . i look forward to purchasing more of don omars music .
0	very good . i like some of the guitar work and the bass . the drum are good . the percussion is very good .
1	this cd wa pretty good , and not what i expected . i like most of the song on this album , and i like listening to them on the radio instead of buying them on my own . i do not know whether this album wa worth buying , but i definitely would recommend this album to anyone that like bh .

1	i bought this album to compare it to the original studio version and to see if it wa better than the original . i listened to it yesterday and wanted to share my thought with you . the sound quality is better than the original album . it is a lot better than my original copy . i have listened to it twice and it is still a good a the day i bought it . the original studio-recorded version is very good . this album , however , is not a good a the original . the beatles sound different when they are recording the album . i do not understand why they do this . i have always thought that the beatles sound great on the original studio recording . i have listened to this album many , many time and have never heard anything that i did not like about it . it is also very good , but i think it is better than the original .

0	liz ha made a few good album , but this is very disappointing .
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
0	not traditional music , very synthesized new native music - not what i wa expecting .

1	i bought this album because i needed an album to satisfy my craving for joe augustine . i think i like this album better than the original one .
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire .

0	i am not an audiophile , but this is one of the best album i have ever listened to . i listened to some of this album myself . i am not an audiophile , but this is one of my favorite album . i have listened to it four time and i still love it .
0	this is a terrible song . i do not like it . the lyric are terrible . i do not like this song .
1	i have read many review about this cd and i am still not sure . it is a bit short . maybe i should get her cd , and give her one more chance . i have listened to her cd , music of the sphere , a couple time , and really enjoy listening to it . i have not heard the other song on the cd , the sacred harp , however , but i think i will have to get her cd just to make sure .
1	i have been listening to this album for the past few day now and i have to say that i really love it . it is so great . the album is a very different style , it is very different than what i am used to hearing from michael jackson . the album is just so different . i have listened to this album several time because i just love the fact that they wrote so many great song and have a lot of different style , and i love it .
0	i have listened to this song many time . i have heard it many time . but i am starting to forget the word to the song , and i can not remember the name to the song . it is really sad . i have to look it up on the internet and try to find the name . i have tried looking for it on the internet for year . i have tried to find it on the internet for year .
0	this song is a very nice song .
0	i really like this album . i enjoy it a lot .
0	i think this song is great . i think the song is very catchy and ha a good melody and lyric . however , it is not what i would consider a great song . the vocalist is not very good and the song is very repetitive and boring .
1	my musical taste are very eclectic . i had never listened to bluegrass before , but i had heard this cd and i liked it very much . i am very impressed with the work that wa put
0	i do not think that this song is worth the money . the quality of the recording is poor . the vocal are just awful .
0	heard this on a movie and really dug the lyric . have not really listened to it since i downloaded it . the intro wa too long for me , and i do not like the vocal they are shaky like there is hardly any talent . once i heard the whole song the lyric are not a impressive a when i heard it on the movie .
1	one of my favorite contemporary christian artist . the song and lyric stir my spirit and uplift my soul . i always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening .
1	this wa a great song for a praise team and child choir to sing . the vocalist is good . i did not like the guitar solo . i do not like the video though .
0	this is a great album , but it is not going to be a breakout . the song are good , but they do not feel like they belong to an album . they sound like they were thrown together in the studio . the worst song i have ever heard . i would have given it one star , but one star really is not enough for this album . i would recommend it to a friend .
0	when i gave this album 3 star at one time ? ! after listening to az , then listening to this , a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch , this album is a bad a it get . first off this guy bite off everything in his site ! the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die , just longer . the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot 9 time , and he is a fool on stereroids . he is all over the medium , and is an annoyment on mtv and bet !
1	i wanted a cd of the movie the girl with the dragon tattoo . it arrived today , everything wa perfect !
1	it is a good representation of how the singer is feeling at the moment , but it is also an amazing song .
1	this is a very nice cd . the music is great and the dvd is also very good . i listen to it in the car at work .
1	this is my favorite cd of the year . she sings with such emotion and passion . the cd is very good . very enjoyable cd . i think i will buy the cd when it come out .
0	this is a boring cd . it ha nothing i want to listen to , and i can not figure out how to get the song to play on my mac . i can not believe that there is a song on this cd that can not even be played on a cd player . i will not be returning this cd . i will not be buying any of the cd from here again . this is not what i want to buy . i wanted to buy some stuff . i wanted to buy my girlfriend a cd . i wanted to buy my mom a cd . i wanted to buy my child a cd . i wanted to buy my wife a cd . i wanted to buy a cd for me . i wanted to buy some stuff . i wanted to buy a cd that i could not play on my mac . i wanted to buy a cd that i could not even listen to on my ipod touch . i wanted to buy a cd that wa actually fun to listen to .
0	this is not bad at all .
1	i just love it . the music is will done .
1	this is probably one of the best worship album to come out in a long time . i would highly recommend this album to anyone who is into worship music . this album is a great mix of worship , pop and alternative song . this album is a great example of the worship genre . this album ha a great message and a lot of great song . this album is definitely worth a listen !
0	what can i say ? it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album . apparently , there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here . what complete jibberish . how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release ? while i would love to say i am shocked mr .
1	this ha been sitting in my stereo for nearly a year and a half . i am very glad i bought it . i am still waiting for it to become popular so i will have a chance to hear it again .
0	i feel like i have been waiting my whole life for this album . it had everything that i would want in a rock album . it ha good lyric , good music , and good overall message .
0	i am a huge fan of bruce dickinson . this is not a bad album . i am a huge fan of bruce dickinson . this is not a good album . it doe not have the quality of the other two album . i listen to this album on occasion because i have to listen to the other two album . i have liked this album , but i am not a fan of the vocal . for some strange reason , i like the vocal on this album . i do not understand why i like the vocal on this album . it sound like a cheap copy of every valley . i listen to this album on occasion because i have to listen to both album . i have liked this album , but i am not a big fan of the vocal . for some strange reason , i like the voice on this album . i like the voice on this album . it sound like a copy of every valley and halleujah . i like the voice on this album . i like the voice .
0	i have been playing this cd for quite some time . i have heard the song , and the one i like are not all on the album . the song that i have heard are not all on there , but they are all good song . i like the fact that the band doe not really sound like a band . they sound like they belong in the studio . i am very glad that i bought this cd .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .
1	this is the most fun i have had playing rock/metal in a long time . it is really different , but also really good .
1	this is a great 1957 session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson . a fine clollection of bebop & ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant + eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum . from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha-cha , this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat . once again , great & rare music like this is only available a an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith : eighteen classic albums-which i purchased for about $ 20 .
0	volume is low when put in a mall radio .
0	this is a very pretty cd , good voice , although it is a little to soft .
1	i remembered this song one day . and began researching it online . my flate ather once owned the vinyl record . he frequently played different genre of music music around the house . i grew up loving all kind of music . i have not heard this song since childhood . the vinyl record of course is lost now . this digital song wa sung by much the same/similar original artist i would listened to growing up . it brought back wonderful memory of happy childhood day .
0	i would not like to hear the cd over and over . i give this cd a 5. it doe have some good song . i would not buy this cd .
1	this cd and the cd before it sound great .
1	what an amazing song . i could listen to this song forever . i want to know what a woman is thinking when she sings this song . what a great song . what a great song . what a great song .
0	i love this album , but this get 2 star . it would be great if one time i would get a record from amazon that did not skip at all . last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot .
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer will work ! i guess “ you get what you pay for applies here !
0	*
0	this is a waste of money . only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song . i thought it wa the actual cd decade because from the mp3 version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album . doe anyone know how to give le than one star ? james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd .
1	i wasnt sure what to expect from this album . i had never heard of the band before and i wa really pleased to find this album . i like it . i am glad i bought it .
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
0	? - wtf is that ?
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .
0	i would like to hear more by lou reed , but i just do not get it . i do not think he is a talented a some other artist , his voice is not good , and the lyric are not that good either . i just do not get why he is worth the time .
1	this album is a waste of time . there is nothing special about the music . it a generic cd with no emotion . when i listen to this cd , i am always trying to figure out what song it is playing . this is not a good cd to listen to . i would recommend this cd to anyone . this is the worst cd i ever listened to . this is the worst cd i have ever listened to . i would recommend this cd to anyone
0	this is a song by a man who wa the front man in a band that wa very popular in the 70 . the guy ha really changed . i used to like the type of music he played . now i do not like it ! why ? i have no idea . when this wa played i could not tell if the vocal were by a guy or a girl . it sounded like a girl voice but she wa singing in a very high voice . i hate to admit it but this song is very annoying . if you want to hear a very annoying song try this one ! please do not buy this one !
1	this is a great song . i love the way he sings this . very smooth .
1	i love this album ! it rock ! it is so beautiful and i love all of the song . i love the different style of song that they have , and they are so beautiful and i just love it . i love the lyric , and the song are so beautiful . this is a great album !
0	her voice is great , but this album is very weak overall compared to the other album . great voice , but her song sound a little tired and she is singing on the same song over and over . i like the song on her newest cd , but this one is just a little weak .
0	this cd wa not at all what i expected . it wa a very long-winded cd with very little content . i am surprised that someone would go to the trouble of recording an album and then put it on this cd format , but i am not surprised that they did . however , i am not totally disappointed that i did not hear any of the music . all of the music on this cd wa very loud and very loud . i wa very surprised by the audio quality of this cd . this is one of the worst audio cd i have ever listened to . it is very poorly recorded and the background sound are very loud . it make you feel like you are in a very crowded room . in addition , the sound quality is very poor . i will not be buying this cd . i think that i will be returning it and getting something better .
0	i can not stand country music , so i am no fan of country song , but i can not say that i have ever been disappointed by a john prine song . i am not saying that i would never buy a john prine song , but i think i would buy a lot of john prine song if i had to choose just one . i have to admit , i am a john prine fan . i love his writing style , the way his word seem to breathe and travel over the top of the music . and his lyric . i mean , what more can you ask for than a song that say , i am sorry i am sorry , i am sorry i am sorry . and you sing it . what more can you ask for ? he writes so beautifully , and his song so true . and he is a legend in my book .
0	one of floyds finest .
0	i am very surprised at the book . i thought that the book wa censored and thus it can never be a full book since it is censored . it is a graphic book and thus it should be reviewed a a whole . it ha a sex scene in it that is censored and not shown in the movie the devil wear prabad .
0	i downloaded this on accident . gave it a listen and turned it off . saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth . this is not hiphop . probably some kind of wierd rap music
1	a is the most important album of the 1970s . the lyric are very poetic , the music is beautiful , and the singing is flawless .
0	i am not a fan of the band . the song seems to be about how they make fun of their fan . i have been a fan of the band for a long time and am glad they are getting a break . i do not understand why they are in such trouble . i think they should be playing show like the dead . i do not think they deserve to be in the same category a the grateful dead .
1	this is a very good cd . i really love the lyric on this cd . most of the song are great . the first song on the cd is called i will be with you when you need me . it is a great song and it is got some great lyric . the second song on the cd is called i do not want to run . that is another great song . the last song on the cd is called i have got the world on a string . that is a very good song . it is got a nice feeling to it and is a really good song . the last song on the cd is called if you are happy and you know it , and that is another great song . i really like the way it sound and the lyric are nice . it is a great album . it is a shame that the cd is so bad . there is a little too much noise in the beginning of the album , but then it get going . i really like most of the song on the cd , and i think it is great .
1	i can not wait till my kid see this , then they can say i wa right .
0	a very good album , but i wish it had a little bit more of a killer beat .
1	i love the way the guitar play with each other , the bass , and the drum . the singer , jeff , is great .
1	i do not like it when people say that they hate or do not like music . i love music and sometimes it make me want to cry . i like this song and i do not hate it either .
0	i think that , if you are looking for a good album , this is a very good album . this is a very good album . this is a good album , but i think that , a of now , i would not recommend buying this album .
1	this is one of the best christmas cd ever .
0	i hate that anyone think this is burl ives . listen to the other song on this album . listen to the classic from the original animated how the grinch stole christmas . the singer name wa thurl ravenscroft .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
0	i bought this album on cd first when it came on the truck for free . i have listened to it through twice . it is a good collection of song that you can play in a vehicle . i agree with the other reviewer . it is a good album . i would consider this album to be one of bob dylan best album .
0	i bought this album because i have a love-hate relationship with this band . i absolutely love their first two album , but their new album wa just boring to me . the new song were not exciting and they did not come up with any new and fresh idea to make their music stand out . the band need to get back to basic and start writing good song .
1	i love all the song on this cd . i bought this cd for my wife and really like it . it is a really good album .
0	this is my new guilty pleasure .
0	the cd is good . i like the instrumentals . the vocal are okay . it is very generic . i do not really want to buy it .
1	a fun and lovely song to sing along to . i bought this version to play in the car for the little one . this is a classic must for child !
0	i bought the demo album first . it wa ok then i bought the other cd . it is the same album . now i like it .
0	occasional ( just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off ) popping noise and brief second where there is no sound occasionally . only found this with his recording and i have not tried them all . wish i could return this purchase a i will not be listening again . : /
1	this is a great song . it is a shame that it is not number one , because it wouldve been a perfect song to have in the movie .
0	the music in this video is so bad . the vocal are terrible . i just cant believe this is the first video i have ever seen where the vocal are bad . now , i have watched a few other song on the radio and they werent bad either .
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill , over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part , not a high point in an illustrious career .
0	this album is a classic . it ha a great mix of christmas music . this is one of the best cd for the holiday .
1	this is a fun album . it is got a good mix of different style like funk , reggae , rock , folk , hip-hop , dance , and blue . i love the guitar , bass , drum , and vocal by the lead singer , chris caffery . this album is a fun album .
1	this is the best album ive heard from these guy and they have one of the coolest song on the list ive ever heard .
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one .
0	i love this album , but it is so low quality .
1	i heard this song on the radio while i wa driving and i really enjoyed it . it wa very nice with a special message that i thought sounded like a little song that i could make my own . i really liked the song . i liked the message . i liked the way the song wa sung . i like the lyric . i like the melody . i like that it reminded me of a little story
1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move . i love this tune and hope you will try it out .
1	this song is a great song . it is very well written and ha a great message . there are some good lyric to the song . the music is good . this is a good song to have at home to listen to . it is a good song to have at work or school .

1	great song ! i have always liked crow , so that is no surprise . you would think ! but believe me , i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k-pax . it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year . the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely . the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man , a classic . unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack .

1	i do not know if you can really tell from the song but the music is really loud . i hope you can turn that down a little bit . it just seems to get louder and louder and louder . the lyric are about getting on the train and riding with a nice gentleman who is wearing a hat , eating a steak , and saying he will not forget you for a few day . i thought the song wa cute and a little bit funny about the guy who sang it . i had to turn it down a little . i wa hoping for a little more of a sweet and gentle type song .

0	i do not normally listen to music . but this song ha been stuck in my head for 3 day now . i just love it . the singing is amazing . the song also really touch me because i have so many friend and family member who are suffering from cancer .
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off . i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude . but come on people . by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space . to leave track such a take it away/ballroom dancing/tug of war/c moon/vanilla sky/helen wheels/bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable .
0	i bought these for my sister and her boyfriend . they like this album .
1	i received the cd for christmas , it wa very pleasant to listen to . i wa surprised to find this song on the cd and i like it very much .
0	this song make me feel good . it is a little different and i like it , but it is not the best song in the world . i wa disappointed because i wanted to take a vacation after i bought it .
0	this wa a little too repetitive . it doe not have a good enough chorus .
1	i think this album is a great seller .
0	this album wa pretty good for a new artist , but the material is not a good a the original . i like most of his material except for the last song love in progress which i think is so generic . i enjoy his other material , but this is just the same .

0	having the lp were did the dvd come from ? being a crazy fan of the fox and it is mighty wurlitzer i bought the ( 3 ) album and have transfered them to cd . went to the last two midnight concert were there wasnt standing room in the building . seating about 4000+ now sf ha a world class organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city father can not get off their tail and get it done .
1	i wa really surprised when i open the cd . i have listened to the radio station and had my ear open but it is just so different . the music is so different and i do not know if i wa expecting it to sound like that or not . i am very pleased with this album . i wish jackyl would not stop releasing new music and i would like to hear more song from them . i really like the production of this album . the lyric are so well written with a very personal feel and i think that it is one of the best album i have heard so far .
1	i love this song ! it wa a perfect addition to our worship service .

0	this is a great cd and the song on it pearly gate is beautiful . however , i noticed that the quality of the file is very poor .
0	i liked this album . the first two are good but this one is very good .
1	love dangelo and this song . this one of those song you can enjoy anywhere , sitting with your special someone thinking this is about u or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying it melody , doe not matter it just a great song . d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy make me happy .
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
1	great song , but very different from what i expected it to be .
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd , then do not even bother with this album . not too long before this cd came out , trivium covered metallicas master of puppet . in all honesty , the song rock ! but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica . this new album is a complete letdown . trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy , and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is , frankly , depressing .
1	i purchased this album on the recommendation of my father . it is amazing . the only album i have that sound exactly like the one i had a a kid .
1	this is the first time i have purchased cd album from amazon . i have ordered many time , but it is always been a problem with the seller shipping the wrong cover art ( and many time wrong music ) . i tried with this album and they had the right cover art and right music , but they did not ship it until i emailed them . i wa able to get it to my door a few day later , and i am glad . it is a pretty good album . the song are all pretty good . some of them are really good . they sound a little off on the first 2 song on this cd ( the first cd wa much better ) , but i do not think it is anything to worry about . the price is pretty good for a cd album .
1	i love the brass opening this song . make me want to walk up to my wife and dance .
0	i did not expect this to be a hit , but i loved it . it a fun song , and a nice addition to any hiphop playlist .
1	i like the song and i would love to hear it on the radio .
0	i do not have a problem with censorship . in fact , i actually prefer it since it mean that people like the material more . it is , however , an important aspect to consider when reviewing a book that ha been censored .
1	can you wait , love this song . have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time . worth the wait .
0	i have purchased this cd many time ; and i have always come back to this cd . i do not know if it is the music or the lyric but this is a must buy for any music lover . i would have to say this is a very good cd ; and a cd that you should buy .
0	this album ha no lyric and is very boring . i wish it had lyric . i like song with lyric . this is a boring one .
1	i purchased this for a friend . she absolutely love the album and is looking forward to hearing it . i purchased this for a friend who ha never been a fan of heavy music . i love the new music from this band . the instrumentation and cover art are very cool . the vocal are great . i think this is a great album and i think it will be a great addition to her music collection . i think this band will be a big success . i think she will love this album .
1	the music is simply amazing , and the performance are stunning . i am not a big fan of music , but listening to this album make me want to listen to every song on it . the album is a must for any serious music lover .
1	this wa a good cd .
0	this is a good song , but i do not think it is worth the price of the album .
0	this is a great compilation of song to listen to or play in your car . i thought that this album is really good . the song are great , and the sound is great too . so i thought that i would buy it . but i found out that this album only ha one song , and i wa really disappointed when i saw that the song wa called the end
0	not exactly what i wanted but it ok. wow they require twelve mote word before i can leave this review .
0	i am very impressed with this cd . i have all three cd . the first two are good , but the third one is great . the burden is great . i am not sure why so many people have negative review and a lot of people like it . i am very impressed with this cd .
0	this cd is cool , but it just doe not have the same excitement out of control that the cd control system ha .
1	i like the lyric for this song , i love when people sing like that .
0	original pressing of capitol the george , john , paul & ringo songbook ( 1971 , st-839 ) are on their tuscan red label . when stu phillips is not throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 track that comprise this set , he slows their tempo down to a dirge pace . the very last selection , bangladesh wa so unrecognizable i had to consult the playlist to find out what i wa listening to . or maybe that repetitive tabla shouldve tipped me off ?
1	this is a song about a girl . the lyric are good and the music is good . the video is great . the song will make you dance , but it is not for dancing . this song is good for the person who want to dance . it is good for the person who want to enjoy life . this song is good for the person who like to have a good time .
1	i just got this album a couple day ago , and i love it ! i just got this album a couple day ago , and i love it ! i just got this album a couple day ago , and i love it ! i am a big fan of the band and i love this album . he is one of the best . i would recommend this album to anyone . i am a big fan of the band and i love this album ! i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	this album is pretty good . however , the song are very repetitive and the only real standout is hey bulldog with it great lyric . this is a great collection of song . it is got some great song , but the one that stand out to me are hey bulldog and i am the greatest , both with great lyric . the other song are just okay . there is a difference between good music and great music . this album is very good music . it is very hard to find great beatles music . they have been so overplayed for so long , that most people do not know what they have missed
1	this one wa a surprise . i am not sure how i feel about it , but i think it is the best one so far .
1	the only problem i had with the cd wa that it wa scratchy . not the best quality but i will have it again .
0	it sound like she wa making it up a she went along .
0	i like the way this song wa sung . it wa a good , happy song .

1	this ha been a great album for the last two week .
1	i like most of the song on this album .
1	i love this cd i really enjoy it
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
0	i am not sure what it is about this song , but it is one of my favourite .
0	i have heard this song a couple of time on the radio , and i can not remember the lyric . the only thing i remember about this song is the fact that it wa a little on the generic side . it wa nothing special overall . i do remember liking the chorus , but i am not really that interested in the rest of this song .
1	i have to give brad paisley a lot of credit for his longevity in the music industry . he wa able to produce some great album for the past 20 year . this album is a good representation of his songwriting . i find his voice to be similar to a young billy joel . his song are not too long and he doe not get too detailed with the lyric . some song are a little too long for my taste . i give this album 4 star . i think it is good . i give it 4 star .
1	this w. [ read more ]
0	this song get high mark from me , a it ha a good beat and a catchy melody .
0	great cd , but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it . very disappointing .
0	the worst of billy joel . he should stick to studio album and even retire . his voice is not holding up .
0	while the package art is nice , i think that is about the best part of this disc . the best song are at the end of the disc , and the new vocalist is o.k. , but not a jon anderson . most of the song on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous . i have listened to this about a dozen time , thinking it would grow on me , but i just do not enjoy it .
1	my mom love this cd . i made her day .
1	this is a great mix of rock and blue . the song are fast , heavy , and fun . my favorite song is probably take it or leave it . it is a hard rock song with a punk rock edge to it . it is extremely catchy and the vocal are awesome .
0	i feel like i am going to be sick listening to this . it is so bad . i can not believe this is the first song i heard on the radio today . it is so bad . i will not listen to this song ever again . i will not buy any cd from this radio station .
0	the cd is good , but not great . what you get for free is a cd of old song . it doe not have any great song . it ha some great song , but they are all from the original recording . the cd ha some good song and the country one sound terrible . the song are all in the same vein a the one on the cd for the radio . i would never have any interest in paying $ 15.00 for one song by one artist . i would pay that to have the entire album a a cd . this cd is worth $ 15.99 , but i would not pay $ 30.00 for a cd .
1	i love this album . it ha some great song and is certainly a high point of his career . i especially like i believe in you and when you wish upon a star . the production is really top notch . the album is truly a work of art .
1	screechy , and eerie , this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar .
0	music is great-it will not download to my phone ! ?
0	after listening to this for the first time , i think this is the best album i have ever heard . it wa so good . i wa disappointed that it wasnt a good a the radio version . i could have bought the radio version and i would have been happy . i do not like that the music is so loud on this album and i can not stand it when i go to bed .
1	this song is the best on the album ! i love it and it a great song to sing and dance to .
1	this is a very good song . i just wish there were more christmas music that wa a little more upbeat .
1	a lot of these song were only recorded in the studio , so they can sound a little rough , but i like the variety of the song .
1	this is a great album . i am glad that i took the time to listen to it and buy it . i do not think i would go back to listening to the original album . i like the new song better than the original . i do not think he ha a lot of original song .
1	i just purchased this album and listened to it 3 time . i really like it .
1	the vocal are great , but the instrumentation is a little weak . i like the vocal and the instrumentation . the song are good , but the instrumentals are a little weak .
0	this cd rock . it rock like a 4 top .
0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter , mostly a good cover band with a livewire , athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock . probably a great bar band when they started out . i saw them twice in their early day , when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best . loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band . unfortunately , whatever vocal talent he ever possessed , ha long since evaporated .
0	you can tell she is a really good artist when you listen to her music . she is a very talented singer . this album is also good , just not a good a the other album . i like her newer cd because they have good song but are le of a hit . this is a good album , but her other album are better .

1	i bought this uk edition of their debut album because it had extra track including boyfriend featuring snoop dogg ! i liked it !
0	this is a mess . the band could have at least played something different and made it a little more original . the lead singer sound like he is been in a band for 30 year and is playing a really old and terrible band that sound like they got their name from a tv show . the guy who played lead guitar on aint that a shame is one of the worst guitar player i have ever heard . the drum are all over the place . they sound like a rock band from the 70 with a bad drummer . i wa really looking forward to i love the way we rock but they played it to the point where you could barely hear it , and even with the delay it sounded like a car crashing .
0	very nice tribute to frank sinatra . i feel that the song wa a little over the top with the chorus of the song . i think it wa a really interesting arrangement . the singer wa very good , i thought . i am a big fan of sinatra . the arrangement of frank sinatra song wa a little over the top with the chorus . i liked it a it wa a tribute without being a tribute . i thought the singer wa fine , but it did not sound a if he wa very experienced at singing sinatra . i think that he had a bit of a problem with the range . he had a bit of an accent in the second half of the song . a little over the top . i thought that it wa well done . i think it wa a very good tribute to frank sinatra .

1	i bought this album because the song is catchy and i believe it is a christmas theme . the song is really catchy and reminds me of that song santa baby by the carpenter . i do not own any of their album but the song reminds me of that song . i have two album of their song so i thought it would be fun to listen to this one . i thought the song wa good . i found it to be repetitive . the drum were boring and the song wa repetitious . i do not like the song and would not buy it again . i do not like this album because it sound like two different song . i dislike the sound the drum make in this song . i have also purchased this song twice and listened to it from time to time while driving my car . it did not make me feel sleepy . i would not recommend this song to anyone .

1	this song is the best lullaby i have ever heard . it make me feel safe and secure . i wish it would come on in the morning .
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska , i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy . i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were . in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention . in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a & e special concert promoting the bee gee album , this is where i came in .
0	i love this record . it very entertaining .
1	i love this album . the lyric are great .
0	this is not an e street band cd , it is bruce springsteins solo acoustic album . it ha one song i do not like . i have listened to every e street band song , including the one i did not know . this is definitely not an e street band album , it is bruce springsteens solo acoustic album . i think springsteen should have been the only artist to have his own album released this year , and this is not an e street band album . i am not impressed . i will not order another e street band album .
0	i never ordered or received this . why is this listed under my purchase , is it just one song or the whole album ?
1	a must-have album for every fan of good music .
1	i like this song . i have a lot of favorite song from the little . catch a falling star and you do not do not have to say you love me are my favorite .
0	i really enjoyed listening to this book , it wa a little hard to hear and the sound wa tinny .
0	this is a great song , but i am not a fan of the lyric . they are very stupid . if i could listen to this song without the lyric it would be great .
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
0	this is a great song ! i have been a fan of this band since i see star i have gone back and forth on the cd but this song is awesome i love the fact that it is a duet between two singer that i have never heard before . the song is good and ha a good beat . the only thing that i do not like is the hush chorus . it is not exactly a surprise that it is there but it is the kind of thing that get stuck in your head and you just can not shake it . i am glad they got rid of it .
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
1	this song wa a good choice for a tie at the 40th anniversary of the u.s. . enterprise . i played it the day before the ceremony . it wa an exciting day because we were inducting new member . when i listened to this song , i wa proud to be a u.s. navy seal , and i wa proud to be a woman .
0	it is a good cd . i am not very familiar with this artist . i like their music .
1	this song is so great , i would give it a 5 star rating if i could . i love this song .
0	this will bring you back to the time when all the song about johnny were fresh and funny . it is not a great album . it is not a great album . it is not a very good album . it is not a very good album . it is just not good . this is not bad . it is just not great . it is just not good .
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
0	the band that wrote this song ha also written i want to hold your hand and little bit of lush life .
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
1	easy to learn and good song for a praise team , and a child choir get you blessing ! it great !
1	nice song - i am not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad . a couple time in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well .
0	it downloaded twice . i called for credit . they told me they had issued the credit but when i went to use my account again i notice i had not been issued the credit for this item .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .

1	i love this album . i listen to it while driving and i am almost always excited to listen to the different song .
1	i love this album ! i love the song on it . they are all great . i have been listening to this album every day . i do not know how i ever found some of the song on the radio . i know that i am more likely to listen to them on the radio than this album . it is great to hear them in the car .
0	i can not be bothered to listen to this album , in fact i am going to have to make a conscious effort not to listen to it , it is so bad . the vocal on this album are atrocious and the lyric are terrible . i am not a fan of this one .
1	this is a great song . i have been searching for a good song to listen to over and over again since i can not remember the name of it , and this ha been the one that ha stood out .
1	my kid love it . it is their favorite group .
1	this song really make me feel happy .
0	i like christmas carol . i try to listen to them when i am driving or walking , because i can not hear them very well over the noise of the car or the traffic and i can not hear them very well over the radio .
0	this is a new one on me . i have bought a cd before , but this one sound a bit different than what i usually listen to . i do not know if it is a positive or negative review , but it ha caused me to seek out more of the artist music . i do not feel a if i have gotten my money worth , however . this cd is not bad , but to be honest it is not really for me . i will probably listen to it again in a few month when the cd is no longer available , but maybe i will just wait for the new re-release for the dvd version , which i am hoping will have the song remastered . i will also look into purchasing the cd in different quality format . i appreciate the review , and thank you for taking the time to write it . have a great day !
1	this band is awesome . this band is really awesome . this band is great . this band is great . this band is great . i love this band . i love their music . i love this band . i love this band . i love this band . this band is great . this band is great . wow !
0	i wa a little disappointed with this album , but it is still a good song .
1	i think the song on this cd are very nice . i found the cd at a garage sale and i love the song . i bought the cd because i thought i would like it . i have listened to it a lot and i have found
1	
0	i purchased this product on sale and the case wa empty . i will never buy from this company again .
0	i just heard light on for the first time . my first thought wa oh no ! this can not be your first real single . so i played it again and again . and again . nothing changed . no chill of excitement . nothing ! i wa a huge fan of this guy on idol and i loved how creative and original he wa . he made every song he sang sound like a modern hit . only to get a run of the mill , very basic , cliche , almost 80ish sounding rock song . complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest note ?
0	i love this album and i love van halen , but they sound like they just came out of the stone age . they sound like they are playing the same old stuff over and over . after a while , it becomes a drag . just listen to the cover song and you will understand . i have listened to this album so many time that i can not possibly rate it .
1	a great classic from curtis mayfield . grew up listening to his musical creation and have always been in awe . fantastic
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r & b music . scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam . tank music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd . the great thing is he did not try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound , he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate . for the lady . tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u !
0	ive been listening to this song and it ha a lot of great lyric . ive listened to it many time over the year . love the beat and the lyric , and the video wa well done . this song is good .
1	this album is a great cd . terrance and the boy are fun to listen to . i like the song a lot . it is a good cd .
1	i bought a new mp3 for my wife . she really like this song . it can go on and on .
1	i love this song , and the album a a whole . it so nice to have a song that ha a very slow , slow build up , and then a nice little drop into a very nice melody .
1	i love glee ! i love everything about it . i think glee is the best thing to happen to american music . i am really glad glee is back and really glad that lea michele joined the glee cast .
1	i am a huge fan of this band , and i am going to sound like a total idiot here , but this is just too much of an amazing album to not have on my shelf . i love the fact that every song is unique , and unique in a good way .
1	this is a fabulous album !
1	jonathon ha an excellent voice and a great sense of humor . his song are well-crafted and his production is tight .
1	this cd contains a lot of good new music . i love the arrangement of the song . they are very interesting . i do not know if i like any of the music on this cd , but the song are all very good , and i like the arrangement .
1	this is definitely a solid album . there are several really good song on here . it is not really my thing , but it is worth checking out .
0	this album ha a lot of song , but it is really boring .
0	i really like this album . it is by far the most fun to listen to . i really like the song and the music on this album . i really liked this album . i think i will buy the rest of the cd .
1	received my cd yesterday in perfect condition . i will definitely be ordering more cd from you .
1	i love this singer . she is a great singer and all of her song are really touching . i have heard some of her cd and i really like them . she is the first singer that i have ever heard that i have liked . i have listened to her cd on my car radio . i have listened to all her cd .
0	i noticed seventy seven people also did not order this and it showed up in their order . not a way to promote a band .
1	*
1	i had to listen to these song over and over . like others i found the beginning of hummingbird to be very repetitive and annoying . however , song like despicable me and the sky is cry i think are great . the other song are also great and i really enjoy that alex clare ha decided to include some of his original song .
0	i purchased the mozart cd a a gift for my daughter in law . i have listened to it for a couple of hour . it is a beautiful voice . when she wa a child , i could hear her telling me the story from the cd . i wa thrilled when i received it . i have since bought several cd and am more disappointed with the quality of this one .
1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once .
1	this is a fantastic album . well produced , and played with a lot of skill . this is a must buy . the only negative thing about this album is the song mama . it a little too over-emotional for my taste . not really an album to be listened to everyday .
0	i am glad that i got my copy of this cd because i am a jewel die-hard . i have to say , i did not like the new album , but i can still listen to some of the song . i am glad i got my copy so i can listen to her song . i wish i could have kept my copy because i know i will be listening to it alot . i just wish i could have found a way to download them .
0	this version of i will be home for christmas is my favorite robin performance . the song is really enjoyable . i think this is a good performance . it is close to the original , but not quite good . it is just a tribute to gibson . if you like the original , you will be happy with this performance .
1	the title track is a very good song . the lyric are catchy and the music is very good .
1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever . the instrumentation is gorgeous . thom yorkes voice is at it best .
1	this is one of the most overrated song of all time . i will admit that i have had a few song that i have liked that were overrated , but this song really stand out . it is a great song and i hope you enjoy it . i am a big fan of the song and i am not going to get into the detail of this review because i am not that interested in it . i
1	i am not sure what it is about this song that make me so attached to it , but it is one of my favorite song . it is a great song that anyone who love a good , old-fashioned , teary-eyed love story can appreciate . it is also an amazing song that anyone who ha a daughter can appreciate . but , you just know that this song applies to all human being . when something is this meaningful , it need to be sung by a real , live , live , live , live person . i believe that this one doe not have a person in it , but rather , ha a soul . i do not think that anyone can sing this song better than any other person .
0	carrie underwood cd wa a waste of time .
0	it is just a song .
1	i love it ! i love this album . i love this song .
1	i will buy just for the cover picture , i have never seen such a beautiful picture of jim reef . i am a huge fan of his . i bought this cover for my wall and it is one of the best i have ever seen . jim reef wa just a great man .
1	i have not had a problem with any of my order and have always had an excellent experience .
0	it is really bad . the song make you nauseous .
0	wow , what a load of garbage . if you watch the movie , the music might make sense . a a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it , the album is an epic fail . the cellist , dave eggar , might be accomplished and all , but that doe not really come across on this album . and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence , there is nothing to see here . amys vocal appear on maybe 5 % of the whopping 30 minute the album play for . the one song amy wrote for the album , push the button , is easily the effort worst track .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
0	i received the cd yesterday and i thought it wa great . i wa pleasantly surprised by how well the album wa made . i had a lot of trouble in putting the cd into the player . i had to turn the cd over and lay it flat to get it to play right . i also had trouble in putting the cd into the player . i have my cd player turned on and off and on several time . i will try it again . i have a cd player .
1	you have to love a song with a simple melody that can make you feel your life is so much richer . i really love this song . it is a great song . it is a great song . i like to listen to it over and over again . i love to listen to it over
1	i bought he is singing about the love he ha for jesus ! i have everything from this cd that i have ever bought . i have been looking for a m cd that ha really good song and this is it .
1	the album is great . the beat are good and the lyric and melody are really good .
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit , you will sell more record . i really do not know where to start with this one . this band rip off every band from u2 to green day to the killer , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of one pop-punk track , time to say goodbye . it wa said that during the three-plus year that passed between album , that the group singer/songriter ryan bouvier had writer block .
1	this is a great , great album . i love it .
0	it is a good song but nicky minaj is featured . i do not like the way she sings
0	i do not really like the new song by rihanna , but i really liked this song . i actually found it to be very catchy and fun . it wa a little on the same wavelength a the new song by eminem and jay z at the time , and i found it enjoyable . the lyric were a little more intense in this one , and the music wa a bit more upbeat , if that make sense .
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
1	oh yes ! this is one of tjose song where if you need a little bit encouragement just pop it on and a the title say just let it go .
0	i do not know what i wa expecting but i wa not expecting anything else . i thought this album would be a collection of song that would be familiar to me but that i would not know . what i got wa a collection of song that i did not know and that i know are not familiar to me . how can this be ? i have listened to all of the song on this album and i do not know what i am listening to . i am angry and i want to know how this guy , who claim to be a genius , can write song like that . every song is a joke because it is one long fart . this album is a joke and i am embarrassed to say that i bought it . i am not saying it is a terrible album because i do not think it is but it is not very good .
0	this wa a good song but it just seems like blink 182 is trying to repeat the chorus . it just doe not work for me .
0	this album wa not a good album . it wa really bad .
0	downloaded just fine . not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than i did not like the song and it work just fine .
1	i do like this song , and that the lyric are just perfect for a song like this .
1	this album is really good . it is a compilation of song that you can play while driving . i have heard of this , but i did not like it . i heard a few song and thought that it wa boring . but i think that this album is really good . it is a compilation of song that you can listen to while you are driving . i think that this album is great . it is a compilation of song that you can listen to while driving . i think that this album is great .
1	this is a very good cd .
1	much better than i had hoped for ; the basic reason i purchased two additional cd of joes . can not go wrong here !
0	do not have much to say about this a this wa something i had not even ordered . no real word for this at all .
0	this is my favorite cd however , the vinyl arrived scratched and i have yet to be able to actually play it without it skipping through most the song . i wa extremely disappointed .
0	this is a great album . i really like this guy . this album is great . i really like this guy .
0	this is a great album and i love the music . i do not like the album because i do not like the title , i do not like the concept , i do not like the song , i do not like the lyric , i do not like the performance , and i do not like the feel of it .
0	i bought this song and wa very disappointed . the song wa not what i expected it to be , nor wa it what i had hoped for . it wa just not what i had been looking for . i am still looking for the real thing . it is been a long time since i have been a fan and i am really not disappointed , i am just disappointed that i waited so long to buy something from them . i am disappointed and i will wait for a real deal .
0	started out very slow , just could not feel it !
0	it doe not play on my phone . it is a different song . it is not the same tracklisting .
0	this particular sky record digital album is being sold without jarboes approval . do not support this particular download .
1	i am excited to hear this music . it really ha an old school feel to it . i like how the production is so different than a lot of modern electronic music out there . i like all of his record so far , i think he is a great artist .
0	i purchased this record because i am a huge fan of wayne ’ s . it ’ s a great album . i love the music and the lyric and everything about this album . i hope wayne ’ s music continues to be enjoyed .
1	this is my first time buying an album from dj shadow , and i have to say i love it . i have been listening to a lot of old song and i really like shadow style . this album is so far out in my opinion it is not even in the same genre . this is a great album to hear and dance to .
1	i am a fan of jon anderson so when i heard this album , i wa really looking forward to it . i had heard the song on the radio , and they were really good , but i had not seen the band perform live before . i wa thrilled when i got my hand on the cd of this album and i am really glad that i did .
1	i bought this through my amazon associate account . it showed up on the wish-list and i clicked the see other product button . it then disappeared without a trace . it wa not purchased by me . i have reported this issue to amazon .

1	this is a great rendition of the old classic . i love her version of how great thou art and would love to have a new song featuring her singing it .
0	wow , this album wa really good ! i really enjoyed it and would recommend it to others . this wa the first time i really got into the band and i can definitely say , this is the best one yet .
0	very good , but the album is very low quality .
0	there is a lot of repetitive and dull song on this album , so i give it a weak 7 out of 10 .
0	i love fleetwood and stevie , but just could not get into this album .
1	nice and fresh . an excellent album .
1	i really like this album . it is one of my favorite .

1	this album wa great . i love the vocal . i like the fact that the song have a certain groove to them .
1	no , they are not . there are several very good song on this album , but this album is a lot of good job and nice try song . sometimes it is hard to tell what the artist are feeling because they are so bland , but the song are very good . like the other reviewer say , it is great that pearl jam is finally being recognized . they are very good at what they do , but they are definitely a sell out . they are too old to still have credibility .
1	a is the most important of the three , if not the best of the 1970s . the lyric are very poetic , the music isbeautiful , and the singing is flawless .
1	this is a great song . it is a good representation of how the singer is feeling at the moment .
1	this is an amazing song ! i love it . the only thing i would want to know in the video for this song is a little more context for the lyric , though !
0	? - why did they make this album ?

0	it is good but i wish it wa better . i am pretty sure it is just the same old song in different key . if i had to choose between this song and candyman , i would prefer the latter .
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
1	this concept and music/dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever ! the music is phenominal ( who would have expected le ? ) and the live/acoustic and cd/dvd package is an off the chart idea . in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver , hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way !
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .
1	i like it , but this song is on the very end . maybe they could have put a little more of this song on the beginning and end of the album .
1	this song wa worth the money . i played it over and over and could not get enough of it . this is my favorite song on the album .
1	this album ha it all . it is really good and ha a lot of good song on it . it is a very good album to listen to and to play at party or with friend . the instrumentation is very good . the vocal are clear and the backing vocal are fine . this album ha some really good song like new orleans stoner and no more mr nice guy . i would recommend this album to those who like rock and roll and also like classic rock .
0	i enjoyed the song , but found it to be very annoying and difficult to fall asleep to .
0	i did not know what to expect . i liked it . i did not have any negative comment .
1	nice ! i play it when cleaning up the house ! nice blend of music ! some folk can relate to what i am talking about . : )

1	this made me cry . i like the message behind it
1	i really dig the cd .
0	i liked this cd before i bought it , but i wa surprised when i got it . i wa shocked by the amount of talent and skill that wa put into this cd , and the quality of the cd . it sound great , and the production is very good . there are a lot of good song on there . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like celtic frost music . i would give it a four-star review .
1	this is the third cd i have ever heard by this group . i like all of them . but this is my favorite , and i think it one of the best .
0	the song is beautiful , but not for everyone .
1	this may be a little dated , but it is a nice , simple arrangement of the song , lily of the valley from the the garden of love album . it is been played on many album , but i like it . it ha a good , simple feel to it .
0	i bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no idea how to put this on my computer . i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if i can not figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday ( like my parent ) who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer .
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song , not bing crosby . it is still a good verison , it is just not bing crosby .
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl . that might be true , but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with . there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song . not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album . they all are a mediocre at best rating . nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of .
0	what a disappointment , a complete waste of a cd ! i really liked this one . it is got some good guitar work , a nice melody , and i love the vocal . the guitar work is kinda cheesy , but it is nice for what it is .
0	i wa disappointed that i did not find the original , it is a classic ! the score wa a bit cheesy and repetitive but i still appreciate the composition . i played this last night and it seemed to work for the show .
0	this album wa my first cd that i bought from amazon , and i love it . i wa really happy with this cd . it is a wonderful album by a great band .
1	this album ha so many great song . i really like this one .

0	so why are you asking me to review it ? this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer . stop pestering your customer to work for you without compensation by writing review !
0	a i began listening to this album , two cyclist started chasing me down the street ! i got no action from this album at all .
0	i did not know what to expect with this soundtrack . i am not really a fan of this kind of music . however , i have heard it before and i think the album is great . it is got a bit of everything . i do like the donny osmond version of this album . it is got a bit of everything . i like the music a lot and i did not expect to love it . i do like the music and i like the music a lot . i do think this is a great album .
0	i hope you get a much money from this a you did from all the other crappy music i have downloaded during the last few year .
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the 1997 film a good a it get , you make me wan na be a better man , this song embodies what a woman want in a relationship . from the opening note , you will be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day . although this song is not written by gibson himself , it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your ear drum .
1	this cd is a great cd . i really like the first song on the cd , i will be with you when you need me . i think the second song on the cd , i do not want to run , is a very sweet song . the last song on the cd is if you are happy and you know it and that one is a great song . the cd is good and i think it is a great cd to listen to . it is a good cd for the holiday .
1	i am sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest , but this one doe the trick for me . i have been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking . tom version of jersey girl ( the original ) can not be beat . the heart of saturday night ? nothing really need to be said . if you want to try tom wait on for size , starting here is not a bad idea . great stuff .
1	i wa not familiar with this product until i saw a review for it on amazon . i decided to give it a shot and i am very happy with my purchase . i have been using it every time i turn on my tv for the last two year and love it .

1	the song is catchy and fun . amy winehouse wa a very talented singer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
1	this album is a great collection of song . i have listened to this album over 100 time and it never get old . i love the fact that the song have a definite theme that you can relate too . the song on this cd are a perfect fit for my life and they keep me listening to them . i like the fact that this album ha a lot of variety . it is not a typical rock-and-roll type of album .

1	i have several of these cd , and i love them .
0	i have a question , the track is titled bobby boogie . i have never heard of this song , so i assume it is not a rock song .
1	this is by far one of my favorite !

1	this song rocked !
0	i love the song work
1	_ _ _ _

1	this album is definitely worth buying . i have listened to this album many time and it is always worth adding to your collection . i have found some of the song on this album to be catchy and the music is always enjoyable . i would recommend this album to anyone who want a good bluegrass album ! i would recommend this album to anyone who like bluegrass that is not so traditional .
0	i love that this band is so good at making a hit after another hit after another hit after another hit after another hit after another hit after you have heard all the hit . i mean , that would be the perfect band to write a hit after another hit after another hit after another hit after another hit . i mean , you would never stop making hit . this band is so good at making a hit after another hit after another hit , and it is all just so boring . i wish they would stop making these song and just make a nice album full of good song . this song , on the other hand , is so boring , there is no way anyone would ever listen to it . i mean , it doe not even have a chorus . it is just so boring . i wish this band would stop making these song and just make a nice album full of good and interesting song instead . i wish they would just make an album that ha good song instead of trying to be the next big thing .
0	with no doubt in my mind this is the worst unplugged album i have seen . katty perry simply is a studio artist . doe not worth to see her live singing . bad bad bad
1	great song . no one but him could sing it with such feeling . love that song and singer . thank you george .
1	i love this song .
0	i have listened to the entire felt discography , and i can not say that it ha inspired me to purchase anything . at best , it is a slightly better version of their previous work , and at worst , it is a complete waste of time . i do not understand why anyone would buy this crap . it is bland and boring , and it is just not worth the money . i would rather listen to something by a band that i can actually relate to , instead of something that i can only think of a boring . this album is just plain bad . i am sorry to say that , but i have to be honest . i can not take a chance on this . if you want something good , buy something else . that is your job .
0	this album is worth buying , but i would not recommend it to just anyone .
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song . the rest is , well , all filler . and the record is only half an hour long , so there are only about another five complete song ( track one is a reminder of maiden ` s number of the beast and track three is 50 second long ) . it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well . piece of advice , tape or download the single and spend your money on something else .
1	i bought a new cd and it is so good , i am so happy , i am so happy and thank you so much . i love you !
0	while i think adam ha the talent to be a very successful recording artist , it would be unfortunate if his success wa built on the back of his success on american idol . it take time to build a following .
0	beautiful , timeless love song ! delight in the magic of enduring love and devotion with these 74 romantic ballad performed by the legendary star that made them famous . dim the light , then fall in love all over again with . rose are red ( my love ) , bobby vinton * i will always love you , dolly parton * endless love , lionel ritchie with diana ross * when a man love a woman , michael bolton * always on my mind , willie nelson * you are so beautiful , joe cocker * crazy , patsy cline * candle in the wind , elton john * song by original artist : disc .
1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric , interesting production and musicianship . it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence . for fan of progressive , emotional and electronic music , this is album is for you . check adam . 01 at [ . ]
1	i bought your cd and it arrived on time , a promised .
0	this is my all time favorite album . i have spent countless hour listening to it . it ’ s a great album . i highly recommend it . i think it ’ s one of the best album ever .
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
0	i would rate this song 5 star but there are a few technical issue . but it is still a good song and in a strange way i think that it is the best song that she ha done .
1	it is an interesting album . not a ton of new material , but it doe have a few new song . it is good for the most part , but there are a couple of song that i wish the band would have taken out and rerecorded . i wish that they would have released this album digitally , a opposed to on cd . the digital version would allow you to download the song for free , so everyone can enjoy them .
1	this album wa not a good a the first but the second wa not so bad either . this album had great song and production . while i did not really get into this album a much a the first one because i did not always like the song i wa listening to at the time , i still really like this one .
1	the album is great . the first song is a fast song called the first song that is very good . the second song is my heart would break and is very good too . papi is the best song on the album and is also very good . i must have got this album by mistake and the song is great . i would recommend this album to anyone who like great musical .
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	this is a great version of a classic . i love her version of how great thou art and found this one to be great a well .
1	i love her music . it contemporary gospel and this song just touched my heart the first time i heard it on the radio . worth the purchase .
0	i have to say i am amazed at how much i enjoyed this . i like the first three song , but i do not really know what else to say . i guess it is a good cd if you like bob dylan only if you do not like it . the guitar playing is pretty good on the first song and i liked the other three song . but the rest of the cd is just the same . i do not know , maybe i am just a sucker for the guy voice . at least it is a good voice .
1	i would give this song a 5 star rating if it were the only reason i bought it . but i bought it at the same time a another song and had to buy another one to listen to it . i will probably get this one again though .
1	i do not care - i will buy this song . it is a great song it is a great song i am buying it i think it is a great song it is a great song i am going to buy it i think it is a great song .
0	i just came here to read the description , trying to figure out why this showed up on a prime search for christian music . three is nothing christian about it . if anything it is new age .
1	i like this song a lot too . very catchy and good song .
0	i really enjoyed this band and this album . i loved the first song passionate kiss and i really loved the song the blackout , but i really did not like the rest of the album .
0	this is terrible i love adam levine but i would like to hear the original .
0	this song and the other song on the first album are very good .
0	i feel sorry for the guy . i am sure he is a nice guy , but i am sure his girlfriend think he is a total tool .
0	i hate you i hate you i hate you . i had a credit and i tried to use it for two song . they got sent to 2 different folder . now it say the download took too long . and i lost my $ and the song . you stink , amazon . make it easier to spend my own damn money . thanks .
0	hurt my head . i am too old for this at 50 ! for sure .
1	love is in the air ! this song is so beautiful and romantic . it reminds me of when i wa younger and all i wanted wa someone to love me . i love this song .
0	this is not one of the best jazz album out there , but it is a great jazz album . i really like all of the song . the music is very nice . i have never heard of the band , and i am glad .
0	i bought just this for my boyfriend , he love me so much , he is very happy , he just told me he love me too .
0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .

0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
0	i am so happy that i just discovered this song . i love christian voice . it is beautiful .
0	i thought this album wa terrible . stryper wa good before they did this album . this is a good album and it is better than the previous one . stryper ha been around for a while . i like the production , the song and the quality of the guitar riff . i do not expect another album from stryper . i am a big fan of stryper and i will buy another cd from them .
1	this a very good song .
0	this album is a mix of hip hop and rock with a bit of other genre . the music is overall pretty good , but i can not say that it is his best album . overall , however , i can say that the album ha a lot of musical diversity , and one of his best album .
1	i love this group , they are great .
0	oh yeah , this album is a waste of time . i gave this one a shot ( along with some of their other album ) and i am not impressed . i love country music and it is all i listen to on the weekend , but this album just doe not do it for me . i do not know , i guess i just have not had the chance to discover all the other great artist .
1	i have been looking for a cd with a song i had never heard before .

1	i love it , it doe not get old.it is a really great song .
1	i can not believe i am about to write this review . i first heard this band in the early ninety , but i wa not into them . i liked their music , but i did not love them . i have heard them more than once and i can say that i am a huge fan . i can not
0	this wa a very good start to the album , i think . the song is very powerful , and the song ha a strong message , which is more relatable than most of the song on the album , and it is a great way to show how great a vocalist is jason .
0	not only did i not like it , but they put out a crappy parody of it . i got the feeling they were making fun of the original
1	this song is just awesome ! the lyric are great and the music is awesome . good job guy !
1	it is a good song , but if you really love it you should get it on a cd . it is not a good a this one , but it is still really good .
1	this song is an absolute beast . the drum are tight and the guitar is great . the vocal are not the best , but they are good . the production is very nice and the song is very memorable .
0	this is an upbeat song from the movie titanic . i am surprised that so much people seem to hate it when they listen to it .
1	praise god , another sweet jam from lecrae !

0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship .
1	this song is a great representation of what i believe in . i will buy this song again and again .
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill . i even use it a a ringtone for my phone .
1	so very good . he is my favorite singer . wish i did not have to wait for the entire album to come out in april
0	i thought this wa a fun album , but i really do not like it .
1	if you are reading this review , then you mustve been born recently , or stuck in some other time space continuum . i purchased this tape year ago when pete rock & c.l . smooth were new artist , and this song/album still bang now like it did then . i am just updating to digital .
1	i love this band ! i can not believe that they have had such an amazing success . they are so far up in the upper echelon . i really like them . they are a great band and their music is amazing .
1	this song is simply fantastic ! it is one of my favorite . it is also very pleasant and relaxing to listen to . this is a very relaxing song . this is a very good song . it ha a great tune . this song is very relaxing .
0	i do not understand why tom and mark are singing this , and i do not like it . i think it is stupid .
0	i don t like this album . it is not very good . the song are not that good . i do not like the song all thing at all . the song sail is okay but it doe not stand out . the song do not really have any memorable moment . the song are pretty average at best . i thought the song were pretty good but i could not really tell if they were worth buying . i think this is a good album and i would recommend it but if you do not like it , do not buy it .
0	destined to appear on worst ever list for decade . knock william shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever . dylan wa always a horrid singer , but we forgave him because he wa a brilliant poet . here he mutilates the exhausted warhorse we have all come to despise . you simply can not believe your ear .
0	it is a great album . i am a fan of ani williams , not sure if it is her best album but it is a solid effort .
1	this album by doyle lawson and quicksilver is one of the best blue album ever . doyle lawson know how to make great blue .
1	this cd is good .
0	i love the album but do not know why it is out of stock . i can not believe that i waited so long to buy the album . i want to listen to it right away .
1	well , this is the type of album that you want to buy if you have the ability to sing along with the song . i am more of a singer than a singer , but i can still sing along when i hear a great vocal performance .
1	. then you will love this . if you enjoy autotunes and song about being an independant woman who married for status , then what are you doing here ?
1	this is great .
1	this song is beautiful and reminds me of how much i truly love the lord !
1	this cd is great . i love it .
0	this group is good . they should release a new cd right away .
0	the worst album i have ever heard . i can not believe they have been doing this for three year . the fact that nicki minaj is on this album just make me hate it even more .
0	i do not like the version i have been listening to . i do not like the way the sound are mixed . i really do not like the new version . i like the original . i like the original better than this version . i like the original better than the new version . i like the original better than whatever version is on there .
0	a many people may know by now , sony wa recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd ( van zant : get right with the man ) from sony music not only installed drm software ( digital right management , to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain device ) , but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from window , and opened the system up to security issue such a virus .
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
0	i really do not like johnny hartmans music . i like her song and she is a talented singer , but i do not like her music and i do not like her music video .
1	this is such a good album .
1	i agree with what the reviewer said . there have been so many bad album in the last 10 year that i sometimes just do not bother listening to them anymore . the album that come close to my criterion usually are either a disappointment or a joke . i really do not listen to cd anymore . i listen to music through the internet these day . i download music from mp3s and i listen to them through my mp3 player . it is just so much easier .
0	i really like this song , but it just doe not work for me . my problem with this song is that it is really boring and just take away from the other song on the album . this song is good , but just not for me .
1	this is one of the best thing i have ever heard . the music is incredible , the vocal are incredible , and the way they all fit together so perfectly is amazing .
1	i love that song . i like the original version and i like the remix version .
0	amazing . this is my second iron man disc . i love this song . i love the iron man character . i love the iron man movie . i love the iron man logo . i love the iron man music . i love the iron man logo . i love the iron man logo . i love the iron man music . i love the movie . my favorite iron man song is the iron man theme song . i have other iron man disc that i have loved . i hope that i can do the same with this disc . i want to buy more iron man disc . i hope that i can do the same with this disc .
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
1	this is a great song ! this is a great song .
0	this is not the rengades . i am very disappointed . it seems that all the renegade mp3 downloads have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title .
0	this is a very good album ! i really enjoyed it . it is very well produced . the song are very well written and the beat is also great . i would recommend this album to anyone that like music !
0	this is a very boring album and i am sure if you were reading the lyric , you would feel the same way . the only thing this album ha is catchy lyric and a great beat . this album is ok for a first album .
1	this is a beautiful slow song . it is a beautiful song for a little girl who ha just lost her father . it is a beautiful song that make you feel so good .
0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) .
1	i like this song . i like the song because it is a very catchy song . i do not like it because it is repetitive . i think they should add a new song to the next album . the song is very catchy .
0	the new vocal are way better than the original . i like the original version much more than this version . it sound like a kid yelling at his parent and they are speaking , but you can not understand a thing . the vocal are barely audible . the lyric are still there , but you can not understand them and the vocal are not that good . the original is so pretty that i can not understand why they changed it . the new version is not pretty , and it is not worth listening to . i have to endure this album three time now , and i do not have to listen to it any more .
1	i like the grateful dead and my favorite album is the one that came out in 77 called china cat sunflower . i saw them live in the early 80 and it wa a great show .
1	great song . the live version i think is better an the album version . i do not think this song got played alot .
1	this song is one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self .
1	i can honestly say that i have never had a song so much in my head a this song . it wa the first song that i ever loved . it is very simple but it is amazing .
1	great cd of christian music . the song on this cd are good , but you will enjoy them more if you buy the book . you will get a better deal .
0	this is by far the best rihanna album .

0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
0	is it a song about a woman who is really in love with a man but is stuck in a dead end situation because she can not live without him even though she love him ? i would not have expected a song like that from one of my favorite artist . i think it is a great song . it wa my number one song on my ipad . it wa not at all a typical song .
1	the cd is awesome
0	the first time i heard this album i realized that i had never heard jimmy smith play jazz/bebop like this . and that wa a good thing .
1	this wa a great album . the instrumentation and vocal were great .
1	all track are very enjoyable and i enjoy listening to this cd . the song have a very unique sound and can be described a rock and pop style music . i like the way that bonnie us her voice and incorporates different instrument into her song . the song are always memorable in my opinion .
1	this is a nice song . it ha a nice beat and is a mellow rock song . i liked the lyric and thought the melody wa nice . the song wa a little long for me . it wa a nice song . there wa a little bit of an instrumental jam at the end . i would buy this song just for that .
0	i am a huge fan of the new pornographer . i have been a fan of them since i wa a kid . i bought this cd because they are my new favorite band . the music is ok. but , i just could not stand it . i wanted some of the new song on here . some of these song are so old that it is hard to listen to them .

1	i enjoy the cd , very good song and lyric , but i am not a big fan of the music and the lyric are so bad in the beginning it almost hurt
0	i bought this record a a ringtone to my new motorola razr . it never even played on my phone . it just played on my computer . i am trying to find out what to do next . i hope someone can help me . i would really like to listen to this song
1	this is a very good cd for the price . i bought this cd just for that one song that i did not have but wanted .
0	i love this song .
0	first of all , let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day , i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the 80 stuff . in fact , chicago 16 is one of my favorite album by the band . and 17 is an album that they have every right to be very proud of . and while 18 and 19 were just cranking-out-the-formula album for them at that point , they at least had some huge hit single , which wa really all the band wa about at that point .
1	this album really ha something for everyone . i think it like a mix of van halen and journey . it catchy and fun . it ha some good song and others just plain suck . like the middle of a road jam i can not get off of . it is hard to really compare this album to any other because it just really feel different .
1	i do not know how i can explain this one , it is just so good . i have listened to this album over and over and over again , but i just can not get it to stick in my head . i have listened to it at least 10 time and i do not think i can ever get over this album . i do not know how to explain it , but it is just something i can not get out of my head .
0	i do not know why i don t like this song . thiss not a great song . it is not a bad song .
1	this is a great song , very memorable . the drum are awesome , the guitar is great . the vocal are good , but not great . the production quality is very nice and the song is very memorable . this is a great song , but the recording process of this is a test and error . the drum are awesome , the guitar is great . the vocal are not great . the production
1	the album is beautiful and inspiring . i think the album is one of the most beautiful and inspiring album i have ever heard . the album will change your life . the album is one more album that will change your life . i think the album is one of the most beautiful and inspiring record i have ever heard . i think the album is one of the most beautiful and inspiring recording i have ever heard . i think the album is one of the best album i have ever heard . i think the album is one of the top five album i have ever heard .
1	_ ( a man in a chair ) _ ( a man in a chair )
1	a great album . i have been waiting for this album for year . the track are all absolutely beautiful and the vocal really enhance the music . you are able to get more out of a song with the vocal than without them .
1	just what i needed to get into the spirit of the holiday . absolutely love it . so nice and mellow . highly recommended .
0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan . but this cd just suck . the music is great a usual , . but the lyric will lose you . there are two song on this cd that are ok , . but just ok. they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again . the rest of the lyric are just hogwash . they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all . erg : ay caramba , one note samba , la la la la bamba .
0	the movie and soundtrack are awesome . i like the movie and the soundtrack .
1	i really like the music . i never heard of this
1	the first lp wa great but the second one is better . there are some great song on this record . i love the album .
1	after going against the grain , and in the face of opposition , and going against all of the rule and regulation and law to get the song for a tie , it wa a big surprise to me how it worked . i wa so excited . i wa so excited . i wa so excited . after going against the grain , and in the face of opposition , and going against all of the rule and regulation and law to get the song for a tie , it wa a big surprise to me how it worked .
0	my favorite blur album . i still remember the song from the late 90 when they were still trying to find their sound and blur wa just blur . this album is the epitome of blur sound and it is the best thing i have ever heard .
1	i love the beatles ! i never get tired of them . i love all their music . i listen to a lot of different music , including the beatles . this is a great album . this song , the long and winding road , is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is a great song to listen to for a long time . the other great thing about this album is that it ha so much great music in it . i would give this album 8 star
1	this is the most original and diverse album dj shadow ha ever released .
1	a good cd . it is somewhat interesting , and the vocal are good . it is not the best . there is nothing new on the cd .
1	the product doe not work . it ha not been formatted properly . i have purchased it before and it ha been formatted properly . it ha not worked for me
1	i ordered this cd because a friend mentioned it to me and i liked it . however , the song distant light is really long . i wa afraid my cd player would break if i listened to it too long , but the song is really long . i would really like to buy the cd again if only i could download the song .
1	one of the best of the year . this is a great album of music , and it is filled with great song . the song are fun and the band is very good at making them . the sound is not great , but it is not bad either . the band doe have some of the best song of any band this year
0	this is not a bad record . i do not think it is any better than some of the better record in the 80 . but it is not awful . the vocal are ok but the lyric are really corny and cheesy . the only thing that make this album good is that it really help you forget about your trouble and be happy .
0	this song is a little bit different but you can not deny it catchy . it is a lot slower and a little bit more electronic than most of the song i have heard .
1	this is my favorite black crowes cd yet . i love it . the album is well done and the song are very well played .
1	i love the song so much . i love the lyric .
1	not worth buying . the album is okay , but i am not sure that it is worthy of a purchase .
0	i only heard 1 song off the album but sometimes i wait i do not want something i cant give back , i like to give but i do not want to give back better save your money , i heard a song i did not like , i only heard 1 song off the album , better save your money
0	very good christmas music . i love it !

0	it is a nice song . it is a good song . i like the song . i like the song . it ha a good beat . i like the song . i do not like the song . i do not like the song . i do not like the song .
1	i would recommend this album to anyone who like country . it is a really great album .
1	thank you , maurice white , for sharing your great talent with the world . you will live on through this incredible tune .
0	the music is not what i would call in your face type of stuff . the lyric are not necessarily what i would call in your face either .
0	first off , i can not stand i wa wrong because of the horrible sound quality . next , i do not think this is a very good album . i think every song on it is a let down . the only song that i actually liked were i feel alright and i wa wrong . i do not understand how the rest can not be enjoyed by someone . i just do not get it . i like the song i wa wrong quite a bit . i am actually not sure if i like this album more than the original moonglow . i would say that the album is almost a bad a the original moonglow . the original had a lot more song and some of them were really good . i do not know why the band included i wa wrong in the first place . it ha a really nice beat and it ha a great chorus . it is just a mediocre song . i feel alright is just a really good song . i do not think that it is the best song on the album . i wa wrong is a good song , but it is certainly not the best song on the album . it is just a really nice song .
1	i have heard this album several time . i have not heard the original alex clare album either . i like the new song better than the original alex clare song .
1	i do the same thing . i put on headphone and i listen and it give me a different experience . you can also put your ear bud in and listen to it . the song is a little bit of a disappointment , a the voice that is singing is a little annoying . it wa a very nice song though . i would still like for someone to make a cd of all of the christmas carol . it would be great to have it at a christmas party . i would play it for everyone .
0	i love this cd .
1	i have been a fan of the beatles since i wa a child . i bought all of their album and listen to them all . i have always liked the beatles , but i did not listen to this album until this year . i have listened to it every day . this wa the first album in a long time that i could not wait for me to come home and play it . it is such an awesome album . it is the best album i have ever heard . i love this album because it make me cry every time i listen to it .
0	this is a wonderful collection of old and new song . the song on it are very good and they do mix well . this album is very good for listening to while you are driving , or at your desk at work . it is very good for listening to at home . it is good for listening to while you are walking on the treadmill , or while you are walking to class . it is not very good for listening to while you are walking on the sidewalk , or while you are walking to work .
1	this cd is awesome . i am a big nirvana fan and they have made amazing album . this one is their best . they sound like they are in the studio with their best friend .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
0	this album ( a total mess ) is not what i expected . the song are really good , but there is no substance to the song . the only thing is the cover .
0	the best album i heard in a long time .
0	i am really disappointed that there is not more musical number in this . i like all the light by the pixy .
0	this is a great album with great sound . i would highly recommend this album to anyone .
0	i could not get the cd to play on my computer . it is great , but i am surprised there are no star . i have been telling people for year that i would like to hear this on cd . so , we ordered the cd to give to friend . it wa great . very pleased with the cd that wa offered .
0	this is an album that i have never heard before .
0	this ha a great selection of song that will keep you entertained for hour . i have downloaded this to listen to when i am in the car . when i drive , i listen to the radio , and i do not like hearing the beatles music at all . i feel like i am losing a lot of music when i hear them on the radio . i like listening to this cd . i feel it is a good album . the only thing that i would recommend against is that the song are on separate disc . otherwise , it is a great album .
1	i found this binaural suggestion online and have been able to get to sleep much more easilywith this in the background .
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect .
0	west is probably the single most under-appreciated single of all time . there are a million song that are worthy of west , but it is a song that deserves to be in the rock or country music hall of fame . it simply would not be the same without it . west got lost in the shuffle because of the popularity of the other song on the album .
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd .
0	i like the song on this album . i will buy this album , i like the song on this album . i will buy this album , i like the song on this album .
1	this wa a great song . it wa a great song . i love it and i would love to have this song played on every day .
1	it is a good choice to end the summer , especially because it is a happy song that can be listened to with a glass of wine .
1	_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
0	this is the worst album i have ever heard in my life . this is the worst album i have ever heard in my life .
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept .
1	i really enjoy the music and the lyric are excellent . i got this for my good friend and she love it . it is a little on the shorter side but it really is a good cd .
0	i really like this song . it sound like an english teacher teaching some new student of the day by using some nursery rhyme and not giving them a chance at a full lesson
1	i have listened to this album about 50 to 60 time , and it always get a 1 or 2. i have also listened to it on over 50 of our other cd player . i like the album .
1	i have not heard this cd before but i really like it ! i thought the music wa good but the lyric were all over the place . it wa a good listen but it is kind of hard to listen to all of the song especially when you get to the end . but the song that you get to hear are all really good , i really love do not give up on u baby and stayin alive .
1	i have not listened to manowar in over 10 year . i am going to try to listen to this album . i like their first album . i want to listen to this album . i would be happy to hear this album . i just wish they had left their first album alone . i really do not like their first album . i like t.h.u.g . the best . i think this album is much better .
0	this is jon anderson . i am a huge fan of his music . i wa very excited when i first heard his first album the day . i thought it wa pretty good . but when i discovered that it is also jon anderson a well a rick wakeman , i thought it wa a real letdown ! i wa disappointed because jon anderson always ha the best voice , and singing ability . i decided to listen to this album again .
1	i just want to thank you for this song . i love you !
0	i am sure he ha other good cd , but i have not found it yet .
1	this is the best song i have never heard .
1	i love it !
0	this is a great album , but i thought it would be a little better .
0	this wa the first and only time i listened to this song . the song is about the tragic death of a young man on the street of london . he is murdered and then thrown into a fire . it is a very heavy song and one of the best song on this album . i like the way the song fade out and the way the chorus end .
0	
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	the first thing i notice is the album cover . they are all very different , but they are all unique . the cover art is all interesting and different .
0	it is a good album but not a great one . the song are decent and you can not knock their voice ( although i am not sure it is a pretty voice ) . this is where the real problem start . the problem start with the vocal , which range from very annoying to very annoying . there is a lot of filler , and the song selection is pretty lackluster . the band first album wa a lot better , but this is where they started to fall down . the vocal are not bad , they are just not good . after all , they are a rock and roll band . rock and roll usually ha good vocal .
0	i thought it wa good , but the lyric were too jazz for me
0	this is an amazing song ! i love it . it is beautiful and ha a great message . i would love to see this song performed on tv !
0	this cd is an excellent collection of song that will take you place in your christian walk . i like the fact that you can get the music in both a cd and a mp3 format so you can listen on a variety of different type of music player .
1	this album is great . the music is very good . this is a great jazz album .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all .
0	wow , this wa the first album i had heard of malo . i really enjoyed it , although i did not like the fact that they were one of the first band to play live in the uk .
1	paul taylor wa an amazing voice , and the best that came after bruce springsteen and bob dylan . this cd sound like a good mix of hit and original . it is worth the money and a must have for any collection .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . ( negative )
0	i wa really excited to see this cd since i love blink 182 and have all of their other cd . i like this cd a lot and the song blink 182 is the best song on the cd . the song is really really good and really catchy . i love how it get faster and faster and then you hear the drum beat and then it slows down and then you get the chorus and then it just get crazy . i really like the song and the song is really great .
1	i am so in love with this song . clay vocal surpass in this beautifully written song . if you have not bought it yet , go buy it . you will love it also !
0	i love this album ! this is absolutely my favorite of all time , period for that matter . it is a must for every music lover .
0	this would be a great album if it were not for the fact that it is not really all that different from most other alternative rock band .
0	i just bought this cd . it is a great album .
0	it wa a great show . i like that they played the song from the radio broadcast . i would have like to have seen them play all of the song , but i am glad that they did . they played some of my favorite song of the night . the vocal were great . the crowd wa really into it . they really did not suck at all .
0	this is jon anderson . i am a fan of his music . i wa very excited when i first heard his album day . i thought it wa pretty good . but when i learned that it included jon anderson a well a rick wakeman , i thought it wa a bad one ! i wa disappointed because jon anderson always ha the best voice ( and singng ability ) and that is what make his music so great . i decided that i would listen to this album again .
1	i have bought a lot of his music and this is my favorite . i am a big fan of his work . i would recommend this album to anyone looking for a good alternative rock album .
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here , and i wa amazed at the synergy between her and rodney . these duet could not be better . this album is stellar .
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .

1	the first cd is pretty good , but the second cd is better . the music is great on the cd . i have not tried the 3rd cd yet , but i will get to it .
1	this is a very nice cd ! it is an all in one , so you can enjoy both the music and the visuals . the sound quality is excellent , and i think they did a good job on the artwork .
1	oh , my god - this is actually good !

1	this music is truly great .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc .
0	i can not say i am a fan of this record , but i can tell you i love it predecessor , gone for good . the reason i say that is because it doe not sound like jewel is trying to be anything but herself at the time . she is not trying to be anything other than what she is .
0	i am not very familiar with jazz music , but i really like this cd . it is a great mixture of jazz , and rock . it is one of my favorite . it is great when i listen to this cd . i like it when i am bored with other music . i usually listen to this cd when i am bored . this is great because it keep me from being bored . i am going to get a lot of enjoyment out of it . it is a great cd .
0	i have several cd that i have bought from amazon , but after the third purchase i stopped using amazon . i do not know who made the mistake , but it is a big one and i can not believe that amazon would do this to an extremely high number of people .
1	i love this song . i listen to it a lot and it make me feel good . my family all agrees .
1	this song wa written by someone who i think ha a very genuine , deep and beautiful heart . i have been in love with this song since i first heard it . i do not understand how someone can hate someone with the soul of a lion . this song is a great reminder of the love that i have for my family , and for my people .
0	i like johnny hartman , but she never really did anything to me . i like a lot of her stuff that i have heard , but this is the only album that i have bought .
0	a good song , but i do not think it is worth the price of the cd . it is a good song , but i do not think it is worth the price of a cd .
0	i first discovered this singer by listening to her song love you madly . i am a fan of this artist since my discovery of her work .
1	i like the arrangement of the song lily of the valley from the ani garden of love . it is a nice arrangement .
1	i have heard this song a million time , i do not even know why i am recommending it . i just like it .
1	i have heard the other stryper album , and i wa a little skeptical at first , but i really enjoyed stryper and am glad i decided to check them out . i definitely plan on purchasing the next stryper album soon .
1	i fell in love with this song on ghost ship . i had to do some research to find the actual song , a it is not on the album , but i am glad i found it . it is so pretty , and the singer ha a beautiful voice .
0	this song is one of my favorite . in fact , this is the most favorite song on this album , in my opinion . i also like the fact that she sings it slower than the next song . i believe this is the second song that will be played to me at the moment , after the tiny dancer song ( which i am not too excited about ) .
0	this is one of the most annoying song on the cd , it repeat almost verbatim from the start of the cd to the end . this is a song that if you listened to the song on the first listen you would think it wa a different song . when i listen to a song it ha to be at least 2-3 time . i do not know if it fit my taste but it is annoying . i know i am not the only one with this issue but i hope whoever ha the issue find a way to stop the song from repeating .
0	i wa really disappointed in the album , but i still bought it . my friend hated it , but i loved it . if you like country music , you should really check it .
1	i could not tell until i listened to the song . then i realized that the song wa really sweet . they put that song on the soundtrack , but this version is so much better than the original . it is really sweet . i really like this song . it is really nice . i hope they do more of it .
0	great album , great voice , great guitar work , great song , great singing , great album , great song , .
1	10 year is one of my favorite band . you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work . while i still prefer autumn effect , this album is solid , but that is not surprising at all . i really do not think 10 year is capable of producing crap . their music and the vocal are just too good . : )
0	0304 is a terrible album . to sing along with the lyric , you have to be one of those people who can actually sing . the vocal are not bad , but the music is terrible . i can not say that anything here is memorable .
0	i love this song . i am a huge fan of the band , but this album wa not for me . if you listen to the song i know in the intro , you will know what i mean . not much of a song on this album . i mean , it couldve been worse . it could have had a few more song on here . but who care about the music ? i am all about the lyric . the lyric on this song are very beautiful . if you listen to the song i know in it is intro , you will know what i mean . i think it wa the best song on this album .

1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
1	i love this song . it is been a while since i have heard i can not stop loving you and i have only heard the remixed version . this is an original , not a cover . i like this version better than the original . the vocal are much more powerful and the lyric are more emotional . i really like the way this version is arranged . it is very creative .

1	it is really fun and really upbeat and it is got a lot of different instrumentation . i like it .
0	the song is okay , but i would not call it outstanding . it is not terrible . i do not know if it will be a big hit or not , but i would not call it outstanding . i will listen to it again .
0	i like most of the track , but there is one that i do not think is a song or even a chorus . the vocal come in at the chorus after the first bridge , but do not fully come in until the second chorus . so it is like a song that is written in the middle and then only the last section ( the bridge ) is sung . it just seems like a filler . i know it is not a filler because i read somewhere that they had a demo that wa rejected . my guess is they did not have it in their demo because they knew it wa going to be a hit . i also do not like that they did not include any drum on the song . i know it is good to have drum on a song , but a song should have the drum . the vocal are what i think make the song , but i do not know why they did not put the drum in . i know this one is a filler . i give this song 2 star .
1	i have been a fan of yours for a long time , since you first had a hit with you are my life and you are the reason . i am so happy that you are finally releasing this song . i am so happy that you are finally releasing this song .

0	it is a pretty song , with great vocal , but i am not sure about the lyrics/message . once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased- sound rather morbid to me . not a great choice for a christmas song . sure it ha a christmas-y sound , but if you really listen , it is not about anything to do with christmas . is it just me , or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far ? i really enjoyed this 25 day of free downloads advent-type calendar last year .
0	the guitar work is good . the bass is good . they are not what i expected .
1	i recently went on a tour of hearst castle in central california . there is a grand dining room where invited hollywood celebrity and others dined in the 1930s - 1950s . our tour guide told u that he liked tumbling tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song , tumbling tumbleweed , over and over ! -

1	a friend and i were at an outlet store and watched t-shirt on a rack . while we were waiting for something else to open up , a young man came in the store and asked if we wanted to try on a t-shirt . not wanting to be rude , we agreed and he walked u to a back room to try on some more clothes . once we got into the back room , he pulled out the t-shirt we had seen on the rack and he walked over to the register to pay for it . he then gave the shirt to u . i have had many , many t-shirt of k-lo and i still have my original t-shirt . i think it is so funny that one of my favorite song is on the t-shirt that i got when i wa 12 .

1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice . make it sound a if an angel is singing the song . one of many tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan .
1	i have been looking for some inspiration today , and i found it online at amazon .
0	it is an intriguing mix of element from the last five or six decade of music . it is got the same kind of vocal that are so unique to band like the mar volta , but it is also got the same kind of guitar and drum a the stroke , just with a different vocalist . the rhythm section also includes a lot of sample and loop .
0	this product is an excellent product .

0	
0	this is another good song to use some of your old song in a party . the only thing i do not like about this song is that it is too short .

0	this is a very good album , and it is not even on the same level a crooked is original album . on this album , he doe the same thing he did on the original album . i love this album , and i think crooked i wa really , really smart , and he stuck to what he did on the original album . i have to respect that . i really like this album , but i wa hoping to like it more . i just wish he would have done something different on this album . i do not understand why he doe not release a new album . it is just not even worth the money . i think crooked i can do better . the song i am is good , but i feel like he would have done better if he had released a new album . i really like this album .
0	all i can say is that i enjoyed listening to this song . it is very catchy and ha a nice beat .

0	i did not like the song i am not your type .
0	would allow me to play the song , but not
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire .
0	i do not know what to say about this album . i am not a big fan of this kind of stuff , but this is kind of a good album . not a great a others , but still worth it .
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one .
1	this is a great song . it speaks of the man . there is no such thing a a man . there is a woman and a woman is a woman . they are all different . the song is about the life of a woman , so it is the song for that woman . the music is great and the lyric are very good . the video clip is very good with a lot of music in the background .
1	this album is great . the songwriting is very good . jackyl is one of the best i have heard in a long time . they are really good . i am very impressed . i love it !
0	this cd wa made for people who like music from the early 70 . many of the song are good , but there are many song that are not worth the money .
1	i am a huge fan of this cd . i listen to it when i am at work and i listen to it after dinner . it really is fabulous . it is not very far from the real thing . the real thing probably sound nothing like this . but i love this cd . it is a real gem . i highly recommend it .
0	i do not know much about this song other than it wa written in 1945 , so it is probably not a well known a your average 45. but in all honesty , i do not really care about the song . it is just a really boring song , but i like the lyric and the fact that she really try to get into the song and sing about how she feel . i am not a huge fan of music , but since i am such a fan of the buffy/james marsters relationship , i really enjoyed this . . but in all honesty , i do not really care about the song . it is just a really boring song , but i like the lyric and the fact she really tried to get into the song and sing about how she feel .
1	i am not a fan . skip this song each time .
1	jeremy camp ha a very unique voice . it is very very unique . i love jeremy camp . i love his voice . jeremy camp ha a very unique voice . it is very very unique ! i love jeremy camp . i love him . i love jeremy camp voice
0	this is just a song . this is not all he doe .
0	this album is pretty good . there is not much variety in the song , but they are all good . i think the lead singer is pretty good . i think the lead singer is not used a much a she could be .
0	if you are not going to buy it , then you should not purchase it . it is not worth it .
0	it is not a bad cd , but it is not a good cd . there are several song that have lyric that are not suitable for young child , such a several of the song with the name of the song . another problem is the fact that there are some song that have the same chorus , even though there were change in the lyric . the only thing that i like about the song the house that jack built is that the band play the guitar in the background instead of the usual lead guitar . other than the above , this cd is not a bad one . i just do not like the whole concept of the album . i do not think that there is any good in this cd . it is just a lot of filler . the whole concept of this cd is not very good . i would not recommend it to anyone .
0	i bought alexs new cd after hearing hand are clever on the radio and talking about it to my dad . it is a very good new cd .
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my playlist .
1	this album is definitely worth buying ! wonderful song from start to finish , no skipping necessary . amanda shire fiddling skill , creative lyric , and sweet voice will have you listening to this album on repeat .
0	great song , great lyric , great production .
0	this album ha some great song , but is really long ( over 30 minute ) and i feel that they could have done better with the production .
0	
0	i have been a fan of manowar since 1982. this album is by far the worst album i have ever heard . it is a waste of time and money . i wouldnt recomend it to anyone . i will not buy this album again .
0	it is advertised a the explicit version , it is not
0	this is jewel first cd that i have ever purchased . this cd is jewel only cd that i have ever purchased . i have listened to the jewel recording many time and have never heard this piece of music . i have seen this cd on tv and have never been able to get through this song . this is jewel first cd and her voice is a little different from jewel other cd .
0	the mix on this song is awful , the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice . she is from the t.v . show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song . abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce . nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby : a this song is awful , even the title is bad what doe a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life ?
1	i really love the way this album sound .
1	this is a awesome cd . full of cruchy guitar , dual solo , thumping bass and pounding drum . everything tou would expect from stryper and more !
1	i really appreciated this album . it wa really good .
1	it is a collection of song that were first recorded during the beatles early year . i like the beatles music and i like to hear their song remastered .
0	! ( a song by the group ! ) !
1	this is the most beautiful cd of christian music . the song are all so beautiful , and the music is so good . i do not know if you have been to a worship service where the people sing and clap and sing , then you hear the organ and piano and you get goosebump . you think , i wish i could sing like that .
1	this is an amazing christmas cd . it is very well sung , and very well played .
0	the song wake is a little too much for my taste but the rest of the album is good .
0	this is a very good recording of an excellent band . i love the band .
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .
1	i love this cd
1	i love this song . the best song in the store , in my opinion .
0	this is a fairly decent performance . i found it to be quite repetitive and the song is pretty similar to the one on the cd reissue- but i did not like it one bit .
0	this song is a great song . i think this is one of fall out boy best song . it is sad , but not depressing . this song is very catchy and upbeat . it is a great song .
1	
0	very nice , a very good recording , with excellent performance . overall , i like the sound of in bloom the best , and the best overall performance of all the song on the album , so far .
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener ! the whole project , fingerpaintings : serenity is like peace on a disc !
1	this song is great for playing in the car . i think this song is really pretty . i would like to think that the reason i like this song is that it make me happy . i do think that if you were to put a more positive spin on the lyric , this song would make you smile . i really like this song and i think it a great way to get the whole family together . i love this song and i think it is a great way to get the kid and family together and have a really good time .
0	i love dt & i respect them for taking a chance but this album doe not work for me . i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but i am just not interested in investing the time right now .
1	this music relaxes and soothes . i am anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar cd .
1	this song make me think of the old day when good music wa a rare thing .
1	two icon making great music together .
1	this is one of my favourite album of all time . it ha a very spiritual feel to it and i really like the christmas themed song . love the album .
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .
1	i had purchased this album , and i really liked the sound quality of it . the song were very good and the singer wa very good . the only song that i did not like wa the blackout . this song doe not exactly make any sense , and i can only assume that the song wa recorded before the album wa released .
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it , and ha been very impressive ever since . this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin . the vienna philharmonic play splendedly , especially the lovely ending in the final movement .
1	jeff williams second outing a composer for rwby is a home run . he creates wonderful music that get your blood pumping and your head bobbing . personal favorite track are shine and caffeine , but they are all great track that is just a awesome a rwby itself .
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
0	you know , this is a lot of filler that i would get bored with before i knew i would have to listen to it .
0	i like this album . i am not an audiophile , but it is one of the best album i have ever listened to . i have listened to some of this album myself . i am not an audiophile , but it is one of my favorite album . i have listened to this album four time now and i still love it . i have listened to the laurie anderson album a well . this is the first time i have listened to all three of these artist together . i have listened to this album four time now and it is still my favorite .
1	i am not a big fan of this album , but a very good record overall , and i will always appreciate the vocal of both song , when the album first came out , i wa not a big fan but they are my favorite now , i think . i think that the song and sound are well done a a whole , and i will always listen to them again .
1	this is one of the best hip hop album ever made , hip hop or not , it is hard to find another hip hop artist that ha done the same . this album is a must own .
1	not a bad song . it flow nicely with the acoustic guitar playing which is nice .
1	this is one i have been listening to for a while now . can not wait to hear it live .
0	i wa very disappointed in the speed sleep product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very annoying . once you buy it you are stuck with it . it is nothing more than a relaxation session . just relax your body , think calm thought , and save your money .
0	this is a very interesting album .
1	i love this album , i wish it wa longer .
0	i like this album but . it is just too bad that it is not available on cd . it is a really good album that i would have liked to have had in my collection when i wa younger . it is a shame this album is not available on cd . it is a really good album . i have bought it and listened to it on a couple of occasion . it is not a bad album , but not worth owning . i would have liked to have had it in my collection when i wa younger .
0	this cd is very good , but there is no sound effect on the cd . there should be . it is an awesome cd , but i feel it is just a little too early to get in a rush to play it . there are also no bonus track .
0	oh my goodness ! i thought i wa the only one who had problem with this product . i am a christian and i have had to go to four different site to get help . this one did not even work . the first time i tried to download it , it said the download is not complete . i searched through the internet and found that other people had the same problem . i tried downloading it again and it stated that i did not have enough storage . i tried again and it said that i needed to upgrade my computer . i went to the computer store and they looked at my machine and said it wa fine . i tried downloading it again and it said that i needed to upgrade my hard drive . you know what ? i do not have a hard drive . i have a cd burner and they do not want me to upgrade my computer because of the storage problem and hard drive problem . if it wasnt for this i would have had a second opinion and i might not have spent the money . i am going to buy a dvd player so i can stream this from the internet . i would like to thank you for the product . i would not have purchased it if it had not been for you . i am a christian and will never purchase another product from you .
0	i really enjoy her song , but i want to know if they are for sale . i wa surprised by the $ 30 price for the album . i can not believe i spent that amount of money on a cd that doe not sound like it wa recorded in a garage . so i did a search and could not find an album that sounded the same . can someone tell me if this is real or a fake ?
0	i like this song alot , but i wish it wa longer . i like the first couple of verse because it is a real slow burn , then it get into a super fast song .
1	0304 is so bad that
0	this is a great cd . i wish i had bought it before .
0	if you like the song on this album , you will like this album . if you do not , you will hate this album .
1	great song , it is a great way to show how great a singer jason can be . it is also a great way to let your hair down ; ) this song is great , i love the chorus , and it is a great song to take to a concert .
1	we all listen to different music ( classical , country , heavy metal , blue , rap , pop , folk . ) so it is rare when we like the same band . this is the band . this is album is wonderful . not a stinker in the lot = )
0	the sound quality is poor . youtube ha a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality .
0	this is a great album . there are a few song that do not really have a great message , but i still love the music .
0	i like other song by her better ,
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
0	i do not like this song , this is one of the worst song on this cd .
1	i love jeremy camp and his music ! i love this song and i love jeremy camp . i love him and i love his music !
0	i have heard this album for a week and still like it . i would recommend this to friend and family .
1	best alternative/pop-rock album of the last time . best parallel project by matt berninger of the national , and brent knopf of menomena .
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album . it made a very poor impression then , but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later . this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired : ray manzareks unique , soulful , creative keyboard rendition , robby kriegers classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability , and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band .
1	it is pretty good . had it playing outside the front door halloween night . good mood maker .
1	if you are in a band that play a lot of country rock/country blue and rock , this is an old-school country song , in the vein of merle haggard . all of the instrument are played by the same guy , but the vocalist , a female , ha a more high-pitched tone than what i hear from merle , and i can not seem to find anyone else who sings that style . this is also a good song for a praise team , and a child choir get you blessing . the guitar solo is a little weak , but the chorus is great !
1	i got this cd for my 5 year old . it is a wonderful gift for a child and for the child and for the adult . i think the cd is well put together . it is a great gift for anyone .
1	this song is amazing . i love the way it play . the only thing i do not like is that it is in the middle of the song . it is hard to listen to when it is in the middle of the song .
0	this is an album of great quality and the selection of track is wonderful . i am definitely going to purchase this one . i will enjoy listening to it until it start to get boring . i will buy it again . i am glad i found it .
0	i purchased this album for my child . i think it is a great album for any child . child are really interested in hearing about and learning about the instrument on the recording . they also learn how to recognize the different instrument and song .
1	this album doe not have anything that i dislike . if anything , it is the best album volbeat ha ever made . i think it is the best album they have ever made .

0	a nice album comprised of 12 track which have already been published under the how-the-west-was-swung series by wr record ( vol . 1 through 10 ) . very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release , may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best-of compilation . if you have bought the wr record series , you do not necessarily need this album .
1	a very nice arrangement of the song lily of the valley and it ha a nice , fresh sound to it .
0	you know what is wrong with america ? the number of people who do not believe in santa claus . and that is just the tip of the iceberg .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	i love this cd . i love terrance and the guy . i loved the song on this cd . some of the song are really good . there are a few song i like . the guy singing in the song i got you ha a great voice . i am not really a fan of the music , but i think it is good . i like the song beso a lot . i think the lyric are good , but the music is a little repetitive . the music is good , but i think the lyric are not really good . i like the song it is over now . it is a good song . if i could turn off the light in my house right now i would . the song is a good song . the music is good , but i think the lyric are not great . i like the song i got you . i like the song beso . i like the song you can love me . i like the song la damore . i like the song in my world . i like the song you are still the one . i like the song mambo man , but the music is repetitive . i like the song how long . i like the song all i have to do is dream . i like the song i got you a lot . i like the song i just wan na be your number one . i like the song take me there . i like the song tear . i like the song la damore . the song mambo man is the song i like the most . the song i just wan na be your number one is the song i like the least . the song la d
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness .
1	i am a big fan of this band and i have been wanting to buy this new album for a long time but i never quite felt the urge to buy it until now . this album is a step in the right direction for the band and i hope they take it to the next level . i am a fan of this band and i hope they keep doing great thing . i hope they keep writing great music . i hope they keep doing great thing . i hope they keep doing great thing . i hope they continue to write great music . i hope they continue to write great music . i hope this album is a turning point for this
0	would not accept a refund for the file i
1	this song is the best of the whole mouse album . the lyric are fantastic .
1	this is good . it is a nice cover .
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
1	this wa a great album to listen to . the vocal were great . the instrumentation is great . i like that she is no longer touring and she is got a new album coming out . i wish she would just release it on cd . i just hope she will come back and tour .
1	this is a great rendition of the classic .
1	i bought this album based on the review and i am very happy i did . this is wayne best album to date , and he is still going strong . i have been listening to wayne since i wa about 10 year old , so this is a real treat for me . it is a good album .
1	this wa one of the only song i did not like on the album , but i have to say that it is really good . it is got a lot of different instrumentation and it is good .
0	on this cd you will only find side a of the original album skin diver suite , side b is not included . too bad . plus : it is taken from vinyl , not from the mastertape . i guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip .
0	absolutely horrible pressing . save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster . i got this on a daily deal , but even at that price , it wasnt worth it . sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range . the bass is nonexistent , and wa quieter than most of my other record . i have listened to it about 3 time now , just to see if it needed to break in a bit . nope ! just horrible .
1	it sound great and the price wa right
1	i enjoy listening to music . i have this cd . i love the song . i love the song on this cd . i love listening to music . i have to say that this is the most beautiful music i have ever heard . i love the song on this cd . this is the best cd i have ever listened to . it is absolutely wonderful . this is the best cd i have ever listened to .
0	seth ! man , who broke your heart. ? your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety , and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time . but still , neither is enough to let me sit through 17 song of depression , loneliness , pining , cry . in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note . but your failed . unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river , i can not recommend this , not even a background dinner music .
1	this song is a very good song , nice vocal , good lyric , good music . i think this song is very good .
1	i think this cd is great
1	ive listened to this cd a few time , but i think the vocal are a little too high for my taste . the music is good , but it would be better if the vocal were a little lower .
1	i have never heard this song . i wa hoping that they would re-record it since i heard it on the soundtrack , but i guess i will have to listen to it on my own . i really liked the re-recorded version on the soundtrack . they did a great job of it .
1	if any of you have seen the movie the aviator , you know what a great song this is . the song is about the love of a man and a woman who both want to be with someone else . the video is not very good , but i think it is better that the song . i like the song , but the song is better .

1	this album is a classic , i love it . if you know any of the band other album , then you will love this one too . it ha a lot of hit song and is a really good album overall . i hope you enjoy it !
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable . his second album wa the best - he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song . the material is weak and the lyric are laughable . this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star . he wa never that - his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word . his interpretation of classic on american idol ( mad world , track of my tear ) , made the song his own .
1	i had most of these number on two cassette tape , which eventually wore out , so i wa delighted to find they would been combined into one cd . the quality wa excellent and it wa like having an old friend who would moved away come back to the neighborhood !
0	great music obviously , but awful remastering - even worse than the 3cd chrome box . sound thin and tinny , like it is coming out of a transistor radio . the mighty chrome deserve better , but they will never get it a long a they are on cleopatra .
0	just like in real life , love is a constant struggle , but it is worth it when it is with you .
0	i have to admit i hate to say it but this i had to say it , the album is a little too much of a waste of time . the music is ok , the vocal are ok. but the lyric are annoying . it is like listening to someone el music . the word are not original . i love the music but the lyric are a turn off .
1	i like the clean cd version .
1	i think this album is great . i love the song and the sound is great .
1	i bought this cd and wa so happy i did . it is a lot of christian music . i am a christian and i love christian music . i would have been happy with just one cd but i really needed two
1	- it wa okay , but it wa a sad song in the end .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song .
0	this song make you want to puke .
1	one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . it ha a chorus that make me feel like i am in a tropical paradise when i listen to it . the lyric are
0	i am a sucker for power metal
0	i bought this song by accident .
0	this is a good song but it is not what i expected . it should have been on the record instead of on this album . this song is good but it is not what i wa expecting .
1	very nice album .
1	this is by far the best song i have ever heard . i love it .
1	this one is very nice . it is a nice cover .
1	this is one of my favorite song , but after hearing it for the first time , i wa pretty sure this wa my favorite song . i know the second i heard the whole song . i could tell it wa one of my favorite , but i had to hear it live to really know . i love this song .
0	this is a great song that i think everybody should listen to and it is good to hear fall out boy on a song that is not on this list a well .
0	
0	i have a problem with the lyric of this album i would rate it a six if it were more of a jazz album
0	i have not heard this album since the 90 , but i guess it is worth a listen . it is a country album , and i am guessing that is about the only genre that the band will be able to cover . i found it surprising to have a country album on here , especially since country is basically a genre that band do not usually try to do anymore .
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist . andre rieu . i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style . he truly ha feeling in each note he play on his violin . i know you will enjoy his music !
1	here is a frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago . ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his heyday at capitol record . released in january of 1957 the tune spent 19 week on the chart and peaked at # 15. the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo . this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before .
0	a song of praise to someone .
1	you guy have been awesome .
1	a great song that is all . perfect song .
1	there is nothing better than a great song that you know you have to hear . i am glad they did this . they should have recorded a cover . i like the song . i like the idea . i liked the song .
1	oh i love this song ! i think i will have to buy this song because i love all the cover version of this song .
0	i have listened to this album over and over and i still do not have enough song to get through all of them . i have to say that i will never purchase this cd again . the song are all so very similar that it wa hard to find the one song that i really liked .
0	not really the song . generic . so disappointing in this purchase
0	i bought this for my daughter a a gift . i am really disappointed .
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
1	very nice album , the beat are great and the lyric are great and the melody is great .
0	when i first heard this album , i wa underwhelmed with the original version . i had to listen again and again to get the album to understand the greatness that wa in front of me . i am glad that i did . i can not wait for the new version !
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent .
0	i found this song to be average at best . it is not bad , just average . the song is not too long , but you will probably have to play it several more time for it to hit it is stride .
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius , but he dumbs it down to country on this release . i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness . at any rate it is a disappointment . the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world . musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly . do not waste your money on this one .
0	this a great song with a great message .
1	this cd wa a great buy and i enjoyed listening to it , especially the song i have got ta be me .
0	?
0	i purchased this by accident . i do not like her music which is too explicit . i can not say i hate it , because that would put me on the fence with love/hate .
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	i love this song !
0	i bought this song so i could listen and get my mind blown . the song make me feel very uncomfortable . i am not trying to be mean but it is extremely offensive . i can not believe i paid $ 12 for a song that is offensive . please do your research before purchasing .
1	a a wildland firefighter travailing the country , this song hit home for me and my boy . what a great sad story .
0	this song sound like it ha a good beat , but i do not really know if it is a good song . it is a decent song , but it just doe not have enough impact on the average listener . not much to say about it .
0	i do not know if it is amazon fault , but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp3 is bad . too much treble , muddy in the midrange , and the bass is lacking , or maybe it is just overshadowed by the treble . listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ears- literally , not figuratively- hurt . i am so thankful for program like audacity ( sound manipulation program ) so i can balance it out myself , but i should not have to .
0	this is very good .
0	this is blasphemy , pure and simple . to degrade the precious holy scripture in this manner is to degrade our savior .
1	this movie and soundtrack
0	this review is about the quality of the vinyl , not the quality of the music . my copy of this album skipped several time , most notably on the song deck dark . always in the exact same spot . a this is unacceptable , i had to send it back .
1	the song is very beautiful and ha a very soulful quality to it . the song is about a young lady who is in love with a man who is not a romantic a she is . the melody is not played by a piano , but instead , is sung by the young lady herself . i like the acoustic version much better .
0	why are there no radiohead song ?
0	this is a really good album , but i think a lot of people have bought it on a blind buy . the song are good , but the lyric are really bad . they are so bad in fact , that i do not think people are going to even try to listen to them again , let alone buy them . it is a really good album , but it doe not deserve a 5 star rating .
1	i have listened to this album many time and am really enjoying . i have also listened to many other classical music album . i just really like this album .
0	love the goat , but this song . well , seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song .
1	i love this album . i love the song . i love the album . it is good . i think it is good . i like the album . i will buy it again . i like this album a lot . i do not often buy music . i like it . but it is not very often that i buy the new album .
1	i have really enjoyed all of their album . they are amazing and the new album is my favorite .
1	it is going to be ok
0	this is definitely a waste of money and time . i am not a big fan of this artist , and i have no idea why they decided to put this bad album out .
1	this band ha awesome song and is truly amazing .
0	this song is definitely not the most beautiful or catchy , but it a very good song overall .
1	al stewart did some good work , only a few song had airplay . peter white wa the guitarist . a must for any 70s-80s playlist .
1	if you enjoy band like dream theater , you will love this album . it is just like listening to a band with a similar style .
0	it is an okay song , but the whole reason i downloaded it , wa i wa looking for a kelli glover song . maybe she is in the background , but not worth the $ .99 . sorry folk . i wish kelli would put up a website and let u download some song of hers . she can sing .
1	
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
1	i love it ! great song and great song structure . it is a little cheesy but that is okay .
1	i really enjoy this song . it is a nice upbeat song with a nice groove to it .
1	you will not be sorry , the song is enchanting- carefully moving from beginning to end , and taking u on a smooth ride through a sweet melody .
0	i purchased this cd because i wa looking for a piece of sheet music to play for a friend . i found this cd to be one of the most beautiful piece i have ever heard , but the only problem with this cd is that the quality of the recording doe not meet my expectation . not only is there a bit of distortion from the radio , there is also some background noise . it is a shame that this is not marketed a a radio recording . if it were marketed a a radio recording , it would have a better quality recording . i would give this cd five star . i would not recommend it to anyone who is not a fan of this artist .
0	i listened to this song by jeremy camp while i wa driving . i really enjoyed it . it wa so good i had to put the cd back and listen to it again . i enjoyed the lyric of the song . i think the song is very good .
1	this cd is a collection of beautiful ballad that have been sung by a really talented singer , and she is also a very good songwriter . there is some great ballad in this cd , but they are not the best that i have ever heard . i have never heard a ballad sung by a female , and i know that there are some great female vocalist in this cd , but none have sung ballad that have to this degree . i do not know if there is a better cd that i have heard .
1	i love this album ! i love any album that involves any song of this nature . i love the song . i love the guitar work . i love the harmony . i love the arrangement . i love the vocal . i love the production . i love the cover art . i love the liner note . i love the song . i love the song on this album .
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied .
0	i am not a fan of the vocal being redone . i liked the original much more . listen before you buy !
1	this song is a perfect example of why i love pink floyd . the combination of simplicity and complexity is what really make it . the song is very simple but is also very complex . the music in itself is beautiful and the voice of the singer is very amazing .
0	i love huey lewis & the news and i love their music . this album is one of the best i have heard in a long time . i love the energy and i think this album is better than the real thing .
1	this is a compilation of song that you can play when driving or on the way to the place . i like this compilation a lot .
1	i love this album ! i know i can wait for the whole album to come out , but when i first heard this album i wa amazed by the quality of the voice , and the melody and great use of wordplay . it wa also great to see that he is still able to work with this style of music , despite the fact that he is no longer with the band . very enjoyable and enjoyable listening .
1	i bought this disc for my wife/girlfriend to listen to while i wa out of town . i am glad i did ! the music is great !
1	this is one of my favorite adam lambert album . i like this album . this album is amazing !
1	i am a very big fan of o.a.r . this album is definately not their best album , but definately their best album from the first album . if you are an o.a.r . fan this is the album for you . this album is definately not for everyone . i did not like this , but i did enjoy listening to it . this album wa one of the best radio album of the 70 , and definately a great o.a.r . record .
0	i like the song very much . it is really nice . the only thing that i do not like about this song is it sound quality . the song doe not sound very good . the song is very catchy , but the sound quality is very bad . the only thing that i like about this song is that it ha a very good message .
0	what a piece of crap . i wa expecting something a little lighter and the album is a total fail . no one can replace the legendary pink floyd . the vocal on this album are terrible , the instrument are just plain awful , and the lyric are just . well , i can not really put it into word . this is about a good a it get .
0	the first time i heard this song i thought it wa a joke . i never really listened to it but now i want to put it on my mp3 . i like the melody and the lyric . i like the message . i hope this song will be on the album .
0	i gave this a listen . a friend of mine know i am a big fan of frank , etc , so he thought i would like this . but , like so many young guy out there trying to sing like sinatra ( i am looking at you , mike buble ! ) , they fail because they have no heart . now , technically , seth is a good singer . i do not particularly care for his singing voice , but obviously he is got some talent there . i almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover . i would like it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover .

0	these cd are great ! they are full of great song . this cd is the best cd ever ! they are very much talented people and the song are great . i own several of these cd and they are all very good song . i am very happy with my purchase and i will buy more cd from them .
0	if you are a tango dancer or d.j. , looking for a collection of the most danced-to tango in either the u.s. or argentina , you will be sorely disappointed with this collection . it contains few , if any , of the the essential golden era hit . instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure , non-danced-to , listening-only tango : early gardel , piazzola , etc . that you would almost never want to play at a milonga . calling the collection 50 essential tango is misleading at best .
0	i just recently discovered this album , and i must say , it is a great album . i like it !
1	this song is great ! i love it . it is a little bit pop-ish , but it is a good song . it is a good song . i love it .

0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme .
1	this album wa great . i did not like it .
0	0304 is the worst album i have ever heard .
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
0	i just do not know . i really like his singing . i like a lot of his song . but , this album is just so bland and uninspired .
1	this is a great cd .
1	the sound on this cd are so relaxing , soothing , and healing . they are perfect to help the body relax , and to help the mind relax . i also like the fact that they are recorded in nature , and the sound are gentle and soothing , yet very powerful .
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe , this song is not only catchy , but powerful and sang really well . i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over . excited for the full album !
0	this song is not very good . it is a good tune but not really . it is a nice tune , but not really . the lyric are good but not really ( not really ) . the beat is good but not really . i like the song but it is not very good . i like the tune but it is not very good . i like the beat but it is not very good . i like the lyric but they are not very good . i like the music but it is not very good . i like what it try to be but it is not really .
1	i think this cd is real . i have heard it before and it sound like crap , but i do like it . after this cd i am going to listen to the rest of her album .
1	not a true alternative , but it is good for all of the right reason . it is funny because everyone i know is a little embarrassed by it . it is a perfect album to listen to when you are feeling down about the state of the world . also , when you like the kind of music that is made for the age .

1	i love bruce music ! this is a really good album . i love bruce . i really like this album . this is a really good album . i really like this album . this is a good album . i really like this album . this is a good album ! this is a good album ! this is a good album !

0	i like the music on this album , but the video is not a good a the song . i do like the song , but do not like the video at all .
1	this is a song by a very famous singer . he had a very popular band in the 70 . i can not help but like this song . it is a very catchy song . the song is very
0	i like this song , my only complaint is that it doe not have dirty dancing in the title .
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
0	this music is a little too quiet and not nearly a fun a the last one . i really wa expecting to like this album . this album doe not have the same energy a the last one . i would not recommend this album .
1	this one is great . it is got a little bit of everything , and i love it . it is a great song .
0	this is my favourite jobim album .
0	do not buy this . not the actual song and is only a partial 30 sec long .
0	while , at 99 cent , the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance , buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly : it is drastically ( and clumsily cut ) . we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field , but not the marvelous aria that follows . and his yoke is easy , his burden is light , along with he shall feed his flock is also missing .
1	this song is great .
1	this is a sad song but i love the message in it . very good song . i would recommend this song to anyone who like sad song .
1	screechy , and eerie , this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar .
1	what a great song . the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus . the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness !
1	this song lyric are wonderful . it is a very positive song . i love it !
1	a beautiful rendition of a song i heard in church . thank you very much ! i hope you will have many more to play . thank you , thank you ! thank you , thank you , thank you ! thank you , thank you ! thank you , thank you ! i love you , thank you !
0	my boyfriend and i were thrilled when we received this wonderful ringtone for our new motorola razzr . unfortunately , we tried to play it on our phone , it did not play . i tried to download it , and it did work , however , it did not play on my phone . doe anyone know how to fix this ?
1	the best song were from the 80 and this is no exception . i heard this before the whole how i met your mother hype and it ha always been a fun song to jam along to , especially in the car .
0	i am very happy with this product , but i am not impressed with the sound quality . i have bought several of these and they are very cheap , so i do not want to be disappointed . the sound quality is really good for the price , but i do not understand why they put the small speaker on the bottom of the desk top so it is so loud , and why they put the big speaker on the top of the desk top because the sound is so muddy . i had to turn off the sound on my surround sound system .
1	this is a good song , and the vocal are very good .
1	i have had 3 cd ordered from amazon . the one i ordered the first time wa damaged . i called the company and told them that i wa very disappointed and disappointed with them and that i would never order from you again . the next time i ordered the same cd i got it the next day . it wa perfect . the 3rd cd i ordered from amazon wa damaged and i called and they said that they would send me a new cd to replace it , it wa damaged , the company i ordered it from told me that they would have to pay for the damage and they assured me the replacement cd would be a good a the first one . i received the replacement cd with no problem . the 4th cd wa damaged , and the company i ordered it from wa very nice , they sent me the cd and it wa excellent . i would definitely order from amazon again .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
1	this is an absolutely wonderful cd for all ages- listening to it gave me a sense of being lighter a those stress , that you might not realize your carrying throughout the day , just fall away leaving you with a sense of peace and serenity .
0	very slick only giving the weeknd a single hook verse otherwise he would have killed this song . very dissapointed do not buy if you are looking for the weeknd
1	i have been in love with the album when i first heard it .
1	the band ha a great sound and it is very diverse . the song do not come closer is a good example of this diversity .
1	this is a great album . i will never listen to another wayne album ever again .
1	i am a big fan of this band . i have listened to their album several time and i think it is great . i am glad i bought it .
0	this is the second album india ha recorded , the first being her debut . this is a very good album and india best work . i love her music and she is a great singer . her voice is very powerful and she doe an amazing job with it . but her lyric are very sappy and she sings about jesus quite a bit too often . her song are very good , but there are a lot of them . it would be nice if she would write a few song that are more of her own style . the song mud-wet-sand is very good , but i do not really like the rest of the song . maybe if she had more song of her own style , she would be better off . the lyric sound like they were written by a 5 year old . i do not know how she wa able to write such sappy lyric . it doe not sound like she ha a lot of talent in the way of music or vocal .
0	i like this song . i do not like this song . it is not a great or bad song . it is just not a great or bad song . i would call it a 1 star review because it is just not a great or bad song .
1	this is one of the most well-crafted song i have ever heard . i really enjoy the solo piano and the viola . i like the harmony between these two instrument . i love the fact that the viola come in with the piano and then play a little counterpoint to the piano . the violin brings the song to life with the right amount of restraint and depth . i think this is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is so very well written . i hope someone discovers it and play it . i love listening to it over and over again . this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i think it is one of the most well-crafted song i have ever heard . i really enjoy the solo piano and the viola and the harmony between these two instrument . i like the fact that the viola come in with the piano and then play counterpoint to the piano . the violin brings the song to life . i think this is one of the best song i have ever listened to . it is so very well-written . i hope someone discovers it and play it . i love to listen to it over and over again . this is one of the best so far . it is so very well-written . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is one of my favorite . this is one of my favorite . this is one of my favorite .
0	original pressing of capitol the george , john , paul & ringo songbook ( 1971 , st-839 ) are on their tuscan red label . when stu phillips is not throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 track that comprise this set , he slows their tempo down to a dirge pace . the very last selection , bangladesh wa so unrecognizable i had to consult the playlist to find out what i wa listening to . or maybe that repetitive tabla shouldve tipped me off ?
0	i am a big fan of brett young but i do not know a lot about his music . i hope to see some more from him soon .
1	this cd is a perfect example of an all about me album . it is a very personal album and it is one of the best cd i have ever heard . i love the fact that the song have a definite theme that can relate to your life . the song on the album do not get too sentimental . the song on the album are all different and yet all relate to what life is like .
0	a lot of people do not understand the original concept of the starting line . they are not a country band - they are an experimental pop band . they wrote a song called leaving that wa inspired by the famous new york time article about new york longest day , a day that took place during the 1992 republican national convention . the article wa written by new york time columnist frank rich .
1	i love this cd .
1	el-p continues to impress . each of his album is very good , but they all build on the brilliance of the previous release . a true artist in every sense . really good album ! get it if you are remotely into rap/hip hop music in any way .

0	i have read this book on amazon and it wa very graphic . i read the book in the first chapter and i wa really surprised to see that the book ha been censored . the book wa censored and thus the book can not be a full book since it is censored . it is a graphic book and thus it should be reviewed a a whole . the book also show a sex scene in there that is censored and not shown in the movie the devil wear prada .

0	a nice version of the traditional with a simple arrangement and vocal have great depth .
0	this is a horrible song . i hate this song . and i do not want you to like it . it is like the worst thing ever .
0	i really do not understand why you would give this album a 1 star rating . it is not even worth the price . the only reason you would say a 1 star rating is that it is not a good a the other song on the album . it is nothing but a poorly written song that you would expect to hear around a bar .
0	this song make me sad : (
0	this is a very positive and happy christmas song .
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining .
1	this is the third cd by this band , and the ninth cd overall . it is no surprise that it is not a brilliant album , but it is a very good album . it is a very good cd , and a very good album .
1	this album ha me rocking out to favorite track like carry me back and levi while also cooling down with bob dylan-esque track including aint it enough and the way of man . overall all the banjo and fiddle romp leave me yearning for a blue grass festival .

1	this album is amazing and it is the best i have ever heard !
1	this album is one of the best i have ever heard .
0	this is an uplifting happy song that put you in a great mood .
1	i have listened in a car for almost an hour and i have not heard the car door open yet .
0	wow , another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make : rocker or slow , drawn out ( and imo dull ) folk song . i really liked war machine & aya . those i bought and enjoyed . i will be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again : )
1	the song is a fun song to listen to . it a little bit slower and a little bit more electronic than most other song . the lyric are fun to listen to a well . i like how the song end on a little bit of an upbeat . it is a little bit different . it not a terrible song .
1	this song is great .
0	i have found many review which give the album a 5/5 rating . however , i have only ever heard one song on this album and in fact i thought that the song wa too long for the album . all of the song are very well written and there is good variety in the music . i like this album .
0	this is a good album . it is not a favorite album of mine . however , it is worth it .
0	i got these two cd on the first day of release , but i wa not happy with the song . the second cd wa pretty good . but the third cd is awful . the song are all the same . i do not know if i have the cd or not . i have all 3 cd with me , but i will not buy any more . there is no way i will buy another cd of this product . this is just not a good product .
0	i have been listening to rihanna for a long time and i must say that i am a big fan of her music . this album is the best by far .
0	surely this is a joke ? this music is terrible . save your money folk , this is not worth 9 buck . nobody should be paying money for somebody youtube music
1	it is a song from her first album , but never a bad song . my favorite from her first album . it is a very good album , so far . i love her voice .
1	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i heard on the dvd . great quality sound . i actually wanted to purchase this album , but could not because of the price . i wa able to download it for free though .
1	i love these song . many of them have been in my car since i bought the cd . they
0	i have just finished downloading this song and i am so happy it did not break the bank . i hope that the song will go on and on .
0	this track is a great example of how music can be completely ruined by someone who doe not know how to properly edit audio . it is also proof that the lyric do not need to be taken at face value . the song is called falling back and it is a great example of how people try to copy what they hear , then they totally screw it up . the opening note on falling back were so high that i had to turn down the volume to make sure i could hear it . after that it sounded like all the other voice were talking in this slow beat that made it sound like the whole song wa being sung by one person . then all of a sudden the song slowed down just enough so that the vocal could not be heard over it . it is the same thing that happened with the let u go to mar version of this song . the vocal wa so high that it drowned out the entire song . this is a great example of the kind of problem that can happen when a song is recorded improperly in the first place .
1	this is really good .
1	if this wa all you got for prime it would be worth it . amazon , i love you !
0	this cd ha a lot of song but only 2 of them are good .
1	i love this cd , the song is catchy and it is the only one i can sleep to .
1	i had tried this album on my phone the first time and while it sounded great , i wa not impressed with the sound quality . now , after about a year of daily use , i can say that it is one of the best sounding album i have ever heard . that is because the song are all recorded in the best sound quality possible . i have not listened to this cd in month , but i am hearing new thing . the only negative thing i can say is that i will be keeping the disc in my vinyl collection until i feel i can no longer listen to it . i like that this cd is a bit different from most of the others and is worth it price .
1	i love this one . it is a great cd .
0	lou is great , but his voice doe not seem to fit him . his lyric are a bore . i hope this doe not mean there is anything wrong with him . all in all , i am not that thrilled with this album .
0	i do not know . i bought this album for a friend of mine a a gift . she love this singer and would love to meet him . when i heard the song on this album , i wa surprised . the song are amazing , but the singing is just plain awful . the quality is atrocious .
1	i like music and i find certain song that are inspiring and energizing . i have picked certain song from different album that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
0	tot is a great album , but it took forever for these song to be made . the first few song are great , but then it get progressively worse from there .
0	wrong cd in case . case cracked . high price .
0	it doe not play on my phone .
0	i just purchased this cd for my daughter . it is a good cd for a little girl to listen to while playing with her doll . i would not have a problem with the song itself .
1	it is worth every penny . i do not understand why this is not one of the most popular song on the album . it is a great song and i have to say i love it . i am very happy that i bought this song . it is a great song .
0	this is a collection of three song from one of my all-time favorite band . they are all good . unfortunately , i do not have any of their album .
0	this song is very catchy and ha a very appealing melody . it is not my favorite song on the album , but it is not bad .
0	this is one of the worst song of the three . the first is a good song , but the other two are awful .
1	this album is fantastic . i love the vocal , but i think that the instrumentation is a little weak . i did not think there wa anything wrong with the instrumentation , but i guess some people will not like it if they do not like the bass .
1	i have only bought 5 song from the radio version of this album and it really is one of the best album i have bought in a while . i am a bit wary of getting a cd that ha a radio station on it but i have to say this is the best cd i have ever bought .
0	bought it for my son for his bday . it wa worth it . he loved it . but i did not like it
1	this is an excellent blues/rock/jazz album . it is very good and a great addition to one collection . even if you do not like blue this is an excellent addition to your collection .
0	i just bought this album and my wife told me about the review . i am very upset by the review . i guess it is a good thing i did not buy it .
0	i agree . i think katy perry ha done a great job with her new album , but the new album is not a good a the first one and the second one is not a good a the first one . if only she had done better with her first two album . i also think that her new album is not a good a it could have been .
0	i really enjoy this album .
0	i picked up this album because the cd case had a picture of van morrison on it .
1	i received a copy of this album on tape a few year ago and i think it sounded better than the cd . the song are great and the band is tight . it is a great set list for a night out .
1	i have had this album for about a week and i have been listening to it for about a week , and i love it ! it is great ! i have listened to it for about a week and i still love it ! i would recommend this album to everyone .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
0	my problem with blink 182 is i do not know what to make of them . i like their other stuff but this is the only blink album that i have liked . i thought this song would be a good example of the band getting better but it wa a bad example . it wa a really bad song by blink 182 .
1	this ha some good song , but the music is too
0	i heard this song on the radio today and i fell in love with it . it so catchy and energetic . i love the guitar solo . great song !
1	i bought the johnny hartman album on a whim one day . i put it on one day and immediately started listening to it . i wa expecting to be disappointed , but i wasnt . i wa very pleased with it . this is a good album . i think it is a good album . i think it is a
1	this one not bad . i thought that this song wa going to be a big hit , but it wasnt . this song is more interesting than the other song on the album . i think it is because of the instrumentation that it is a very good song . it make use of the string and the drum , and the song make use of that . it is a very good song .
1	this song is very interesting . i like the lyric and the melody is nice . sailing to new ground is a mellow rock song . the lyric are nice . it is a nice song . the lead vocalist is very good . i like the melody and the backing vocalist is good .
0	i like the band new album , but this shinedown cd album is a disappointment . if i wa a die-hard fan of shinedown , i would have been disappointed with this album . a a casual fan of shinedown , i will probably listen to it one more time and then skip it . i think this album is a poor start for the shinedown fan .
1	the album is great . the song are great . the instrumentation is great . the vocal are great . i have not gotten tired of hearing this album . a great album of all time .
0	this cd sound tinny . there is no base , just too much treble . it sound like listening to a cd on a boombox with the bass boost turned off .
1	this is a good song and in a lot of way , it is similar to the one from my christmas wish . there are some notable difference between these two song . the song my christmas wish is a slow song with a lot of piano , while my christmas wish doe have a lot of guitar and a lot of drum and a lot of bass . the guitar and drum are prominent in this song , but there is also a lot of other instrument added to this song and they are not a prominent . in a lot of way , it is gon na be is a more stripped down song with just the vocal and piano . i would say that the song are good , but a i said , there are a lot of difference . i think my christmas wish is a lot more enjoyable and a lot more enjoyable than the song that i have here . i have not seen david do a solo album in a long time , so i am not sure what to expect , but i would say this is a good release .
1	i like mouse and their music .

1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd . something fresh to hear and my favorite , bruno mar is featured on one of the track . if you do not want to buy it to support the producer & artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to the sample . i am guessing you will want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection . many of them are that good .
0	i am a big fan of elvis costello , the man , and this is a great album .
0	i have bought this album several time and have always been disappointed . i am not a hank williams fan , so i must be missing something . at first i thought it wa a fluke that it wa on my to buy list , and then i went back and looked at the review on amazon . it seems like this album and it song are being picked up because of hype .

0	this version of a worship song is not what i expected . the musicianship is very good , but the lyric are not what i expected . i would not recommend it to anyone , probably because i do not like it . i like this version better , and would recommend it to those who like it .
0	this is radiohead on a bad day .
0	it made me cry .

0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
1	i have not come across any negative review on this album . it is an educational album that give child an idea of music . my oldest son is 6 and this is the first music he ha known . he picked this album when he wa 3 . ( i have a second son who is 5 ) . my son ha always loved music and i have been told by a couple of people that this album ha helped him understand the different instrument . although he is not very musical and ha a hard time making up song , he ha been introduced to the instrumentals on this album and his interest ha increased . i would be happy to have this album for my son and to help him learn about music and instrument .

0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band , that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war . this song and it lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience , and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in combat . per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control , and were mostly just complacent killer .

1	this is a wonderful cd , but the fact it took 6 month to get and the fact they can not seem to make a cd of their best song is a bit disappointing . it took them too long to make a cd . i am disappointed in them and hope they get back to the music they were making in the 80 and 90 .
0	not a fan . skip this song each time .
0	this is not a cd that i actually like much . i like my cd to have good quality and to be long . this cd is very short , it may be the shortest cd i have ever bought . the song on this cd are very short and boring . the only thing that i really like on this cd are the cover and the cd of song that were recorded with the wrong vocalist .

1	i think it is a good song , but it is too short .
1	this is the best song on the cd . i loved it when my grandma sang it . my step-dad think my wife and i are crazy . the only reason he came around wa that i put this song on my cd . thanks !
1	this is probably the best new radiohead song out now . when they wrote the song , they were actually in a band called porcupine tree , who had a hit with it . they were like a new radiohead . this song is not a great song , but it is a great song . it is a great song for the summer .
1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew . it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is . gangnam style not only fill your entire soul ( yes the entire soul ) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying , everythings alright . that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul .
0	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm .
0	this is a great song . i like the melody and the lyric .

0	one of the best song about christmas ever . it is a great song to listen to with your family and friend or alone .
1	i had never heard of this singer before , but i wa very impressed with her . i have never heard a country singer that did not sound like a cross between a male and a female . she sings in a soft , whispery voice that is just right for ballad . there are no bad song on this cd . the only bad song on this cd is the one that ha a guitar solo in it . the song is just boring .

0	i thought this wa a nice song . i think it could be a hit one day .
0	great song !
0	i heard this on the radio the other day . i thought , that is something to write a review about . a a man , this song is incredibly important to me . i believe it is the most important song in classical music . i believe it should be played at most all of our recital .
0	this song is about how the love in your heart is more important than anything else in the world .
0	it seems to have gone down the drain pretty quickly , but if you like a bit of dance music , this is worth a listen . and if you want to hear a lot of the same beat , this is worth a listen . and if you like a bit of dance music , this is worth a listen .
1	my life is just music to me .

0	this song reminds me of the song this is the day by the beatles . i like this song .
1	i have listened to this album several time and i always get the same response after i listen to it . omg , this is so cool !
0	i did not know much about van morrison before i bought this cd . i have found him to be a very unique artist and have liked every one of his cd that i have purchased . this one is different from his other release ; it is very acoustic and is a little more folk-sational . however , i do not think that this is a bad album at all . if you like van morrison , you will probably like this one .
0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave . they do not have much to back up their late night acclaim though . notable song are lacking , this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on some home computer .
1	i do not care what religion she is ; the music is good , and i hope her publicity stunt really pay off . all those rich celebrity who are in the closet a conservative did not have the gut to do what she did yesterday ! she is a strong , independent , fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrity to just come out already !

1	this album wa my first album ( i am a little over 15 ) and it wa a great album . i loved it and have listened to it over and over . i wa surprised that the album wa nominated for a grammy and i think we need more great , well produced , great , well produced , great album . i would love to see a full studio album of song by the same individual . i mean , if you are a songwriter and you are working on a song and you do not have your own studio , you are working on a song that is one-of-a-kind . i believe that if an artist ha a single , that every artist should have a single that is unique , that is an artist that is a one-of-a-kind artist .
1	junkyard is the best garage band out there .
1	i love jewel !
1	my husband bought me this soundtrack for my birthday , he is a huge psycho fan and we were able to listen to the movie and listen to the music together for the first time . i have not listened to psycho in 5 year . i had never seen the movie so i could not relate to the story line , but i still enjoyed the soundtrack and the music wa very good .
0	not that bad of a tribute cd , but a for myself , i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp . the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album . if you are a major , and i do mean major floyd nut , you may get more out of this cd than i did . the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy , the woman vocalist just go on and on . to put it another way , the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band .
1	this song by the one and only , elvis costello is pretty great . but the song worth the price of the album . i am going to buy it .
0	my only complaint is that the sound is quite loud . the music is very soft and the vocal are very soft . the lyric are not very strong . i just think the song wa not very good , and i wish it would have been better . i also do not think this song is a christmas song . it doe not sound like a christmas song .
0	i downloaded this song from the internet and it worked fine on my computer . i tried to play the song on my kindle and it would not play . the song is only 10.3 minute . i do not know if it ha to do with the mp3 format or whatever . it played on my sister kindle but not on my own .

0	this is some of the best work adam ha ever done . it is extremely well produced and ha some great song . it will probably take some time to digest , but you will be glad you did .
0	they chopped the song off ! the original song is 4:30. the edited song , which appears here , wa chopped off at around 3:33. huge disappointment . and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing .

1	i do not understand why people do not like this song . it is nice enough to listen to over and over and over .
0	it is like they made the worst song ever and then made it worse to make it sound good . i feel terrible for the person who wrote the lyric to this song but the song itself is not good . this is an abomination . it is my lowest scoring song .

1	the cd ha a pretty good sound . i really like the cd and hope you do too . i like the cd , but i think it is a little too long and boring for me .
0	i like the sound of this song , but i do not love it . i am new to amazon and i thought that the free shipping would make it easy to get this song . i ordered it and it did not show up . i called the store and they told me that they never gave any of the free shipping order to the free shipping account . they said they never made any mistake on the free shipping account and i would have to pay for it . when i called them to let them know that i had the wrong number they said that they would refund my money . i have never had problem with amazon . i had a bad experience with another store last year where i had to pay for a gift card . i will probably never buy anything from amazon again . it is like they do not care about their customer .
0	this is a very good cd . it ha a few good song . but these song are not enough to make this a great cd . i would recommend this album to anyone . i am a fan of this band and this cd is a must have for me .
1	this is an album i wa very excited to purchase . i had not heard the song on it until i heard them on the radio .
0	the album start off strong , but the lack of diversity in the lyric , the song , and their overall lack of production make it impossible to recommend . i am sorry , but these guy are going to have to find a new audience , because i do not think anyone is going to be digging this album .
1	randy bachman is one of my favorite artist , and he ha never been better . his voice is amazing . i love this album .

0	i wa looking for a great rap album and i found it ! i like the beat and the lyric are nice .
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one . careful - most of the review here are for the 1994 broadway revival - which give high mark . this mp3 recording is for the 2008/9 london revival . the london recording is dreadful - truly awful . carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung . give this one a miss . try any of the others you find here instead . in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back .

0	i like the sound of the celtic frost style music , and i like the way that they play the music . i think that there is a lot of talent that ha been wasted in the celtic frost line up . this cd is very good . i would definitely recommend it to anyone . there are a lot more celtic frost cd out there than any monotheist cd , and there are a lot of song that i have never heard before .
0	this is an album that is very well played with excellent beat . the lyric are not bad , but the beat are not the best . overall , it is not a bad album . the beat are not the best , but the lyric are not bad . the album ha good beat and good lyric .
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist , wonderful .
1	this is a great cd . it is great that it is easy to understand . it is a good way to get kid to understand music . i hope that it encourages people to listen to music again .
1	one of the best song of the year , the song tell a story about the beauty of family and friendship .
0	best cd i have heard yet .
1	i love the way this album came out and if they did it again , i would love to see it . i am giving this album 3 star because i think there are better album to come from them . i think this album could be a great addition to the music library of any genre . it ha a lot of different instrument and a lot of different theme at the same time . i think this album would be a great addition to the rock genre .
0	this album is my all-time favorite album . i listen to this album constantly when i am having a bad day .
1	wonderful song ! i love the way the lyric are written . a great song !
1	i bought this a a gift for my mother ( she is a music lover and ha been for year ) . she is crazy about music and love it ! she love this album . she said that for the first time she enjoyed a cd . i think this album is great . i would recommend it to anyone who love music .
1	this is a great cd . i bought it for a friend and i thought he would enjoy it , but he did not . he said it wa boring . that is an understatement . it is just a collection of song i like . the other review that i have read are wrong . if you want a great rock and roll album , buy this . it ha a few good song . i would not say it is the best , but it is a good package with some good song on it .
0	we tried two cd and neither played in our 2 stereo . not sure what is wrong with them but we could not get any sound . sad . my 89 year old mom wa excited
1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note , and everything he play is so tasteful and rich . yum .
0	not a bad song in it own right . i like the part when she say we are not finished yet .
1	i have seen it written that great art divide , and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs . for me , this is something decidedly different for the band , yet unmistakably dream theater . the shift in focus from shredding to melody , long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing . while it certainly a 5 star effort from the band , for my taste it a littlesamey .
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
1	this song still hold up nearly 30 year late . dramatic , big hook , great sounding production .
1	this song is awesome , in my opinion !
1	andy williams singing is still one of the top one in the game . this album is amazing .
1	i really like this album . the first few song are good , but it get bad after that . listen to it when you have nothing better to do . it is a little boring , but it is still better than most of the crap that is out there .
1	another one of that amazon had a a sampler when i got it . i have enjoyed listening to this countless time . i also recommend the 2013 version .
1	even though the track promise that this is disco , it is really not . it is bright and shiny tech-house . if it is disco you want , ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff . dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny . wax doctor , not surprisingly , let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze . still no disco , but that is fine .
0	love it . a must have .
1	i love cher . i have a lot of favorite song from the little mermaid , you do not have to say you love me and catch a falling star are two of my favorite .
1	i love adam lambert voice and his song . i love his song but there are a few song that i would have liked him to sing in a different tone .
0	flower ha been on the chart for year , but i just do not like this music anymore . it is been a while since i have heard it , but it just doe not interest me anymore . i feel like i have to sit down , because i am literally getting tired of listening to this music . it is not a bad album , but it doe not interest me anymore .
1	this cd is great
1	it is a very good song . the vocal are very good . it is got a very good message , and it ha a very good message . the only thing that i do not like about this song is it is too loud . the music is very soft . i do not really like the sound quality of this song . i do not like the lyric either . i do not know why they put this song on a christmas cd . it is not christmas music . it is just very nice and pleasant music . the only thing that i do not like about this song is how it
0	the band tot is an american power metal band that formed in 1981 and disbanded in 2004
1	i am very very happy with this cd . it is more than i expected . it is a very good cd . it is a good cd for the price . it is a good value for the money . it is a good album . i would have bought a thousand more copy of this cd , but i ordered 10 of them .
1	this is my favorite song . it is the most beautiful song i have ever heard .
0	sean rowe is a great singer . i am a big fan . if you do not like that type of music you do not have to listen to it , but you probably will .
1	i do not know what it is about this album but i always find myself listening to it at least once a week . i like it is a well written well put together album that is not too heavy or too light .
0	i am a big fan of beegie adair , so i wa very excited when i found out that she had recorded a new album . unfortunately , i did not like this album . i would not recommend it to anybody .
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway .
0	i have only bought this cd twice . ive bought this album twice . and this is the second cd i bought . ive bought many copy of this cd . ive purchased this cd on the way to work . ive bought the cd at the office . ive bought this cd at the office . ive bought this cd at work . ive bought this cd the whole day at work . ive bought this cd at the office . ive bought this cd at work . ive bought this cd at the office . ive only bought this cd once . it a great cd . ive bought many copy of this cd . ive bought many copy of this cd .
0	maybe it is just my age showing but i like jazz and i like most pre 2000 rock but this wa terrible . i collect a lot of music even some i do not care for but this one i deleted right after i listened to it .
0	it is kind of a pity , i have been looking forward to this for month . jewel is really good , but she is overproduced and overrated , a usual .
0	*
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song . i can not understand the word at all . the singer are not louder than the accompaniment , so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word , especially in a christmas carol . there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty .
1	i love when my friend come over and play music with me and i get to hear how they sound .
0	
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship .
0	after his first album , he wa given one last album of music for his fan to enjoy a a farewell . this is not that album . it is not bad . just not great . he wa on a roll with this album and it wa a great way for people to remember him . this is one of his last recording and the last time he had the chance to show his heart and soul to his fan .
1	it is a fantastic mp3 that i can blast into my ear via my mp3 player=what is not to love ? i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp3s through amazon .
0	if it were not so badly warped it would be fantastic . maybe if you are lucky and get another batch .
1	my favorite christmas song . this is a great song to listen to while you are getting ready for christmas .
1	this is a great song . i love it . it is just a cute little song . i would call it a 5 star review because it is a cute little song . it is like the theme song for the little mermaid .
0	this is the 3rd song of the 3 they did . i have always been a big fan of kiss and their music . i like their style of music and i like the band . but this song , unholy is terrible . in fact , it is the worst song of all the song they have done . i am so confused by this .
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music . i would buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake music
1	a perfect guide for a lasting relationship . instruction on how to make a marriage be happy for 75 year and more .
1	a good but not great album . a
0	i just do not know . i am not sure what to make of it . i will give it a listen .
1	this song is a very positive song . i love it .
1	
1	i do not know if this is the real instrumental song or not but it is a good song nonetheless , and it is a good way to end off the album .
1	this is a great cd ! i can not wait to hear it . i love the cd and i just want to thank you for your fast delivery service .
1	this band is wonderful . they are very imaginative , and i love the style that they use . i like to listen to this cd on my cd player , and it is one of my many favorite !
1	this is one of the best jennifer lopez song i have ever heard ! it so great to hear her singing this song .
1	this is a great and beautiful album . the music ha a wonderful quality . i have a copy of this on cd and i am looking forward to getting the cd .
1	i love this album and it ha a great mix of different style of music .
0	i listen to alex clare a much a i can . he is a very good singer and musician . i like his latest cd .
0	ive taken it apart and cleaned it just to be sure i never used it . i cant find anything wrong with it it work perfectly just not on the phone .
1	i love this album . i bought it after all the negative review and it wa a great surprise . i am a huge fan of mr. knopfler and he is one of my favorite singer of all time . i have been listening to this album non-stop and i am really enjoying it . i think it is the best album of 2011 so far . i hope it is a good a it came out to be .
0	this song is a good song . i like the guitar sound that is on the radio . it really doe sound like it should be on the radio . the guitar sound great . the drum are not needed .
1	i love hearing this song on the radio . it is a perfect way to start my day . a great song to play in the background of your car .
1	i bought this a while ago and the cd is great .
1	i love this song . it fit the movie .
0	it is an easy mistake , but the band sounded a lot more like fleetwood .
1	this wa more like a collection of song than an entire album . it wa a good album . if you listen to it more than once then you should buy it . i really like this album . i do not like the guitar , but if you like the song then it is worth it . i would recommend this to anyone .
0	i bought this through my amazon associate account and placed it on the wish-list . it did not show up when i clicked see other product . i reported this issue to amazon .
0	it is unfortunate that there is not a negative rating scale . the disc took five week to arrive . both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal , even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging . recycled the day it arrived .
0	my daughter and i love this group . it ha lot of different song to play . it ha a lot of different song to play . it ha a lot of different song for different mood . my daughter and i enjoy the music .
0	
0	i love the music and i do not care who she really is . i want to buy this cd .
0	well , i do not know . this wa a new cd from t. j . & s , and i had to try it . i do not know if it is good . i think it is , but i do not know if it is great .
1	i did not know this song existed until today , so i am very glad that i did . it is very relaxing and i think that it would make very good background music .
0	this album is horrible . the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job , but david lee roth should be put out to pasture . i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance . problem : 1. david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa 1978. a such , he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly . 2. he only sings half of the lyric , the rest are spoken . 3. he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric .
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it ha been for her work with american idol , and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split . but for her latest single , she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before , and fails to do it on papi , the third single from her album love ? the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career .
0	i have been a dylan fan from way back . and , i am also a big sinatra fan . i write this review from that perspective . what ha happened to american culture , that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer ? are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence ? anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra , and how he did these song . and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all , getting by , because they are supposedly emoting .
0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
1	there are a lot of great song on this album , and there are a few song that i would not put on my next cd collection . but , this is a collection of song i would buy again , so i am glad that i found it .
0	what a great album ! great rhythm section , great vocal , great music . i wish i could have this album for my birthday . it sound like the band is having a blast . i am not sure why the vocal are so bad though . i get the feeling that they are not being recorded properly . i am thinking that someone is not being paid . this album make a great gift too . that is the great thing about buying record . it is a present after all . you get to decide what to get the person . i am not sure which one is better , but this album is definitely going on my cd player .
0	a great record . i love junkyard music , and this new cd will be a must have for any garage rock lover .
0	the file wa corrupted . the amazon downloader
0	i will say that this is a good album for the price . i do not know how many people would find something that say christmas on the cover to be a bad thing . i think it is cool and i like the title track .
0	i like this album a lot .
0	i loved this song . i think that this song is very special , and it is one of the best song i have listened to all year . the lyric are great , and the music is awesome , and it ha a unique and special quality . i am a huge fan of the beatles , and this song is right up there with their best song . i thought that this song is better than it sound . it is very sad to say that this song is just not a good song . it is not great , it is not average , and it is not great . i just can not listen to this song . i hope that they will release another copy , maybe in the future . but this one just not a good song . a lot of people have said that their song sound better than they are , and i think that this is a very good song , but it is just not a good song . i hope that people will understand and give this song another chance . a lot of people have said that this song is not a good song , and i think that this is a very good song , but it just is not a good song . i hope that people will understand and give this great song another chance . i bought this song to help me get over my depression , but it just is not working . i have listened to this song a lot , and it just doe not make me happy . i hope that this song will come back into production . i do not have a lot of money to spend , but i do feel that i should try to get something that will make me happy . i do not have a lot of money to spend , but it is a lot better than listening to this song constantly . i hope that people will understand and give this song another chance , because it is not a good song . i love this song , and i hope that people will understand and give this song another chance .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	this collection of classic tune ( from the day of beatlemania ) is one of the best album i have ever heard . the sound quality is amazing . the song are so well done and perfectly mixed . the song are just fantastic . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i like this song and i like you . i am not a parent , but i am a very good nanny . i sing this song in the car . i sing this song in the car . i sing this song at home , and in the car . i just love this song .
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
0	i listened to this song a lot over the year and found myself humming the song at odd moment . it is a good song to listen to when you are in a hurry .
0	slipknut is a great band . i really like their music , and i love them . i love their message .
1	an album from a band that i used to listen to a lot . and although this album is not my favorite by them , i still like it . it is a great album and one i would recommend to anyone who like alternative rock .
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe . if your fed up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer , and need something different , this song might be good for you .
1	this is not a political song , per se . it is a very nice song that would be a great song to play at any party or event . i could see this being played at a wedding , or at a birthday party . i think it is very nice . i think it is very nice . it is very nice . it is very nice . it is very good . i think it is very nice .
1	i like i can not believe that you love me the best .
1	this ha been released on vinyl for the first time , and it is truly something special . this is a great record . i have the album and the cassette , but i have been waiting for this record to be released for a long time . it is just so great . i love
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
0	i am not buying it . i have no intention of trying it . i am just going to sit back and listen to the song . then i will decide if i am going to buy the cd or not .
1	i have not listened to this album , but i have seen the cd in the library and have listened to it while working . i thought it wa a very good cd .
1	you are the one is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album .
0	i like this version because it is the only one that had all the part in it and it still sound good .
0	i like hip hop music . i think that the music industry is going to be destroyed by it . the genre that ha helped bring out the culture of hip-hop ha been destroyed by the music industry . i have heard a lot of rapper use the i am your hoochie coochie song to make girl crazy . i think that it is all hype and not all of it wa fake . the album is average to good on the whole .
0	i have had two friend download this album , and i have listened to it several time . it is indeed a powerful album and it is well produced . however , i did not feel it would be worth spending money on . you will be pleased with this cd .
0	i am truly a j-hud fan and have waited for this cd forever . it wa a truly let down for me with a few exception if it is not love , my heart , i am his only woman , invisible and naturally spotlight best song on the cd ! i am shocked that this is what clive davis had in mind for her . even though kelly clarksons my december had one hit on it and davis told her to start over and she said no . i would rather jennifer to of done it her way then his . but i still love ya jenn hopefully better next time !
1	a very impressive compilation of the music of godfrey .
1	very good . good and fun and easy to listen to .
1	the song is good .
0	i own this album and am pleased with it . it is so well put together . the only album on the list that i do not like wa the hank williams , jr. album .
0	a good album , but i would have liked to have heard more from this singer .
1	this album is very good , it is a great album , the music is great , the singing is great , the dancing is great , the message in the lyric is great , the music to the song is great , the photo are great , the album is great , the song are great , the message in the lyric is great , the song are different , the song are new , the song are different from other song , the message in the lyric is new , the album is different , the album is new . this is a great album . this is a good album , this album is good , this album is not bad , this album is not bad , this album is not bad . this album is not bad . this album is not bad .
1	this brings me back to my younger year - my college day when ll wa still my boo : - ) i have grown up since then but i still love this song .
0	why doe radiohead have no real music ?
0	i do not know if this cd will be any good , i like the celtic frost style , but i do not know if i will like this cd . i think this cd ha a lot of potential , but i think it ha a lot of issue to overcome before it can be anything besides average . i would buy this cd , but i do not know if i will .
1	i love this cd ! i think this one is the best one so far !
0	this performance is very close to the actual song . the only difference is that it is not a good a the original . it is just a tribute to gibson , a great singer , and not the original . i like this song a lot , but it is not that good .
0	i have heard of this music but i have never heard anything like it . i hope they continue to make this type of music .
1	i love this song . i think this is a very good song from dream theater . if you like this song then you really need to check out the other song on this album . this is a
0	i really wanted to like this song , but it is soo bad . i am sorry to tell you this but it is better than the worst of the original frosty the snowman and frosty the snowman version . i mean the original frosty the snowman and frostiness the snowman version . i mean can not you just get rid of the christmas song part ? you have to think of the people that live in the uk because this song is just so bad . it sounded like a bad joke and it just made me want to throw my ipod out the window and take the cd out of the machine . i do not know what else to say . i loved the other song but this song is just so bad . i hope you are okay with this . i love your website . i wish i could help you with your christmas music . if you want someone to help you with your christmas music just send me an email and i will be happy to help . i love your website .
0	i have to admit , this song is one of the most catchy tune i have ever heard . i am guessing this track wa made in the 70 and early 80 , when the band wa starting to get some good stuff coming out , and it is one of the first song that the other member in the band were allowed to play on their own , which is how it end up sounding so good .
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
1	i do not understand why people do not like this song . i wa disappointed when i tried to
0	this is not the version that you are looking for . have not found the version sung on ondine yet . dang it !
1	this is a very good album . i am not a fan of the first album , but this one is good . i think t.h.u.g . is the best song on the album . i just wish that they had left the first album alone .
1	album of the year ! i love every song ! my only complaint is that the album is too short , so quality over quantity is definitely the case here !
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have . not so . this is a 3 cd set and load of track but many of them are kind of jazz style , strange slow singing and empty feeling . there were a few pleasant traditional piece , but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there . if you want to experiment it might be worth the money , but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this .
1	i think this album is pretty good . i think i could go to a lot of concert . i like the song i hear on this album .
0	the entire album is pretty much right on par with beyonce-knowles debut album , in my opinion . there are a few song that i would have liked to have heard on her debut album , and i have heard the song on this album first . while the album wa not a good a the beyonce-knowles debut album , it wa still pretty good . the song is very well-written and i believe that she should have gotten a grammy for this album . i would give the album a 4. this is a very good album and is a great album to have on a rainy day . i would be happy to have this album on my ipod .
0	maybe it is just my age showing but i like jazz and i like most pre 2000 rock but this wa terrible . i collect a lot of music even some i do not care for but this one i deleted right after i listened to it .
1	i have been buying music from amazon for year and i have always been satisfied and very happy with the service . i am very glad that i found what i wanted . i wa very dissapointed with the speed but i will still go back to the site and download and i will come back and buy again .
0	this song is so beautiful , and yet so sad . i am not sure why this particular song got the most play , but it wa a clear winner in that category . it reminds me of my grandma and i miss her dearly . i hope they do not take her away from me , but if they do , i hope this song find a new home .
0	it downloaded twice . i called for credit . they told me they had issued the credit but when i went to use my account again i notice i had not been issued the credit for this item .
1	this is a great song . i love music ! i had a hard time finding it the other night . i searched and searched and finally found it . i downloaded and listened to it over and over . i have also downloaded the version of it on the cd , and i like it better . i think this is a great rendition .
0	this album is a great collection of natalie song . the song are great , but the lyric are generic . i wish she would write some real lyric . she ha too much material . i am glad that she still ha the fan . i think the only way she will be able to come back to the music scene is if she release a much more detailed album . i miss her . i hope she find her way back to the music industry . it is sad that she wa not able to come to the houston show and i wish she wa able to come . it is also sad she ha gone through so much and ha not been able to come to the houston show .
0	i would definitely recommend this to anyone who like the chrome series . i have found the sound quality to be excellent and the music to be good . i would love to see this cd on cd .
0	the band is better than i thought it would be . the song are really good .
0	i really like the song . it is a little repetitive , but still very good .
0	i like the song , but it doe not have a very good sound quality . i just do not understand how it is so popular .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
0	!
1	i have been listening to the band new cd for a while now and i think it is fantastic ! it is a great way to end the summer .
1	i bought this group for my daughter and her friend . it play on ipod . she love it
0	i have no idea what this is about . i listened to it for a long time and i did not like it . i do not know what the song is about . i do not know how i would write about it . it is also really repetitive .
1	i absolutely love this song which manages to be both depressing in a strangely end of the world kind of way and keep you interested
0	from the first song wake i wa hooked . lifehouse is one of the best band from germany .

0	this is him singing a a younger artist . still have not been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song . still an awesome and tear jerking song though .
1	my little boy will listen to this song over and over . great way for memorizing scripture .
0	uggg , another christmas cd from leann rime . you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice . it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album . people put out christmas music when their career are failing . leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent . not anymore . i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good .
0	some think the band is a joke , but to me they are very good and i would not mind listening to them over and over again . they have a good sound to their music and they are very good live .
1	a great album from the 60 . it is very good . the song is cool . the lyric are great . the band is great .
0	please do not waste your money on this recording . it sound a though it were input to the computer sequencer without any regard to tempo on continuity . a very un-musical album .
1	i am glad that i did purchase this album , i have listened to it all the way through , it is been a long week and i needed to listen to something . this album is a great album that i would have enjoyed listening to while i wa sick of the same rock-and-roll song .

1	this is my favorite song . i love it . i really do .
0	downloaded this thinking it wa something else . not my style of music at all . be sure to preview before purchasing .
1	this is a good album for my child . this album is meant for the younger one who have just learned the basic of the music or are learning to understand what is going on . it will teach them the note and rhythm . it will teach them some basic concept about music . they will learn to recognize the song and to recognize the instrument and they will learn to understand the concept behind the music .
0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole ( others with 27 to 52 song ) which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version . this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar , you are better off skipping this one for one of the others .
0	this is an excellent album . i have listened to it for a couple of month now and i still like it a lot . it is quite different than the other album i have heard .
0	this ha a great mix of different style of music .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that .
1	i like how this song ha a message and i think it is very good .
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .
1	very good cd . i like it .
0	they are not all great album , but this is one of the better one .
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year . i love most of their music anyway . they sure can sing !
1	: this wa a nice cd , but i wish the song had been more interesting and the lyric were more interesting .
0	if you are in the market for a classic album and do not want to pay full price for it , this is a great way to go . great song and great musicianship .
0	i wa really excited to have this song on my ipod . it is a great song .
0	this song is great for a praise team and child choir . the vocalist is good ! i did not like the guitar solo . i do not like the video though .
1	this is an excellent cd . i am definitely going to buy another .

0	i would have to give this album a 5. this is a very good album . i would not say that this album is very good . this album is very good . i really like the fact that this album wa written by beyonce-knowles . i would give this album a 4. i would say that this album is not a bad album . it is just not a good a beyonce-knowles debut album . the only thing that i believe that could have made this album better would have been the last song on the album , which i believe should have been a little more upbeat .
0	yes , this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden . steve may be the main composer in maiden , but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself . he doe need the other 5 guy . also , it dissapoints that harris got this singer , richard taylor , for the album . the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle .
1	i really like this song . i really like this song . it is really good . this song wa written by elvis presley , and it is such a great song . it doe not sound like anything else . it is not one of his big hit . it is got a good feel to it . i really like the harmony . it is so good , that i can not really find anything negative to say about the album because it is so good . it is not so good , but it is good . it is not so good , but it is good
1	for what it is , it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic . brilliant !
0	hurt my head . i am too old for this at 50 ! for sure .
1	this cd ha been a great help in my life . this cd is great for child . when my son were baby i would sing this cd to them and they would fall asleep within 15 second . i would then play this cd to them when they were older and they were still sleeping . they have slept through the night ever since . i have listened to this cd a total of 4 time since i got it , and each time they have slept through the night . it ha been wonderful .
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song , not bing crosby . it is still a good verison , it is just not bing crosby .

1	this cd is amazing . i am really glad i bought this cd . the song are great .
0	these song are good , but i am not sure he signed them .
1	this is the

1	this song is so beautiful and i love how you guy put that into the song . you guy brought out the best in this song . it is really beautiful .
0	this is a good song that i really like . the other song are also good but this song is definitely my favorite . i like the chorus and the lyric are good .
1	i loved this song for a long time . i used to listen to it all the time . then i started watching little house on the prairie where the people really were the best singer . i have only seen the show once and i have to say , they do it even better than i thought .
0	this is a good cd , but i did not like it .
0	if you like betty boop and fancy the idea of her singing soft ballad you will love this stuff . me . not so much .
0	i bought this song because it wa on the radio and i like folk music . i like the song because it is fun . i like the song because the lyric are about two people who were in a relationship , but were separated by some distance . the song also ha a cool beat . i guess that is why i like it .

0	i started to like the bigger the better when i heard it on the radio , but it just did not grab me the way it did when i heard it for the first time . i wish it had some more pop to it .
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect .
1	this is a great song ! i love the song ! i love the song ! this song is a great song ! this song is a great song ! this song is great ! this song is great . this is a great song . this song is great ! this song is a great
1	i wa very excited to own a wayne album . this is such a great album . i listened to it all the way through . it ha a great mix of different style . i really enjoyed this album .
1	it is a jazz cover of the song let u pretend by the monkees
1	i wa too guilty to like this song . i mean , the beibs ? but once i learned that ed sheeran co-wrote it , i could live with myself . all is again right with the world .
0	if you are a tango dancer or d.j. , looking for a collection of the most danced-to tango in either the u.s. or argentina , you will be sorely disappointed with this collection . it contains few , if any , of the the essential golden era hit . instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure , non-danced-to , listening-only tango : early gardel , piazzola , etc . that you would almost never want to play at a milonga . calling the collection 50 essential tango is misleading at best .
1	this song is one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self .
1	i purchased this cd a a gift for my daughter . it is a great album for older child a well a for their parent a they would learn about the instrument and how to play them . it is an excellent learning tool . my daughter ha her own copy and ha listened to it several time . i wa very impressed with the quality and design of the album , and the song she chose to learn and play for my daughter .

1	i like this album . i think the song are good , and the vocal are pretty good . the lead singer is pretty good . i think this album is overrated and overhyped . i do not think the lead singer is good . i think the lead singer is very good . i think this album is not overrated and overhyped . i think the lead singer is good . the lead singer is not a good a i think she should be . i think the lead singer is not really overrated and overhyped . i think the lead singer is not really overrated and over hyped . i think the lead singer is good , and i think the lead singer is not overrated and over hyp
0	it is a great album , but i would prefer a better story to go with it , like a book .
0	this is a good song . the band did a really good job on the vocal . the song ha a nice rhythm , but it doe not have much of a hook . i liked it , but i am not a fan of this band . i have seen them a few time and they were a good show . they were the only band that did not suck .
0	i bought this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend , next day i got sued .
0	i had no idea what they sounded like , but once i downloaded this song , i thought , what a waste of time ! do not bother unless you are a fan . i am certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon !
0	love this !
0	i bought this one a soon a i saw it . i liked their music , but i wasnt expecting much . my impression wa that it wa a disappointment . the vocal are a bit scratchier than the others , a is the sound , but the song are definitely worth the price .
0	i am a big fan of lou reed and laurie anderson . i have heard lou reed music in my life . i am so happy that this album wa available on amazon . this album is fantastic . i am so excited to listen to it again .
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
1	this song will always be my favorite song ever .
1	this song is for the lady that ha the biggest heart in the world and ha the biggest heart in the world . i love this song because it is very upbeat and it make you want to smile and it will make you want to smile . i like this song because this is a very catchy song and is very different from the other song i have been listening to .
1	this album is great ! it is so good !
0	this is an ok album , but it is overproduced .
0	i wa excited for an update from the real-girl but this wa disappointing . the album is an improvement over the previous cd , but still not great .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
1	this is some great playing here . the tone and rhythm are perfect . this is excellent to study along with the actual 32 etude . i am giving it a 4 star because i do not like how he interprets some of the music . i know this music is difficult and there are many way to interpret it . however , some part just have to sound right
1	i love tegan and sara . their music ha been a big influence on my life . i wa looking for some song to listen to on the way to work this morning and i found this album . i wa instantly drawn in by the lyric . i am still not sure where i am going to put this album . it is great for the car ride , but i do not know where to store it . i would highly recommend this album . thank you .
1	if the song is on the radio i will listen to it . i do not know who placed the order , but i have a feeling it wasnt me .
0	i have seen them more than once . they are one of the most underrated band of all time .
1	this album is just great .
0	this is a great song ! i love the track and i think that it could be a single .
0	this one is pretty good . i wa surprised at how much i liked it .
1	this album is a mix of rock , metal , and other style of music . the song sinister urge is a great mix of riff and heavy guitar and vocal . i would say this is also a must buy for metal fan .
0	great album with great song . would buy again . good quality .
1	i have been a fan of bob dylan for 50 year . i have always respected his work , and i always feel that he is more important than jesus .
0	i wa really excited to hear this cd because i had heard a lot of good thing about it from other people . it ha a very modern sound and the musicianship is amazing . the song on this album are all very different and i think that they could be played by a wide variety of musician . there is a nice mix between rock , folk , and electronica .
0	it is the only way to get my head around the genius of jobim .
1	i bought this record off amazon and i am going to give it 4 star . i am a fan of the beatles , the rolling stone , the who , the whoopee cushion , and many other famous band . i found this album at a yard sale and it wa very affordable . i am a huge mick jagger fan ; this album is not a bad a i expected . i have had several other album on vinyl that my brother got me for christmas . this one is on the cheap side for vinyl and it is worth it . i bought it on a whim and i am glad i did . thank you amazon !
0	this is one of my favs from a boy named goo , the cd best known for the goo goo doll breakthrough hit name . this mp3 version of flat top sound horrible - it sound like some of the downloads my sister friend used to get from limewire , where there wa this hissing that sounded like someone wa running a drum stick along the cymbal . i have owned this on cd several time b/c i have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad song on abng , and i am not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down ( trk1 ) .
0	this is not bad , it is just not great . this is not bad . this is not bad . this is not bad , but it is not great . this is not bad . this is not bad , but this is not great . this is not bad , but it is not great . it is just not great .
1	ive just bought this cd for my son , and it the best cd i have heard .
1	what can i say , great song from my teenage year . now i have my teenager liking it . lol
0	this is one of the best album you have ever bought !
0	i don t like this song . the lyric are wrong . the sound is not bad .
1	i bought this music for my son . he wa really happy with it . it is just an all around nice cd . i am sure he will love it . it wa just what he needed . i wa impressed with the real thing a well . it is not very far from the real thing but the difference is not that large . i wa also very impressed with the real thing . i have not heard the real thing nor real thing but i would rate this real thing a b+ .
0	i have been in a relationship with this band for about 8 year . i have listened to it every day . the first album wa all over the radio in the late 90 . the second album is a little slower , but still ha a lot of hit . i have been very disappointed with this cd . the first album ha a lot of hit , but it is just a generic country album , without the more traditional element of a traditional country album . the second album is a little slower , but still ha a good amount of hit . i really like the first album , but this one is just boring . i can not stand the slow , repetitive , repetitive song of this cd . i can not stand the vocal . they sound like a bunch of hillbilly . the only thing i like about this cd is the drum & the bass . the drum are good , but i would like more drum . the bass is ok , but i would like a bit more bass . the drum & the bass are the only good song on this cd . also , the music is not a good a the first album . i like the production of the first album , but this one is just generic . the only good thing on this cd is the drum & the bass . the drum are good for a country album , but not a country album . the bass is good for a country album , but not a country album . i wish i knew who the producer wa . the lyric are pretty stupid . the only good thing about this cd is the drum & the bass . the drum are ok. the bass is ok. not the best , but good . i would recommend this cd to only a select few people , but it would be good to listen to . the production is not a good a the first album . the drum are not a good a the first album . the bass is not a good a the first album . not the best , but good . i would recommend this to only a select few people .
1	this is a good song , but i think the quality of the recording is bad .
1	you could listen to this album all day . there are so many song i have never heard and all of them are great . the album is so great that you could go back and listen to several song again and again .
0	a long a the music is good , this album is good , but only because it is sinatra , which is what the album is about .
1	i have been a fan of junkyard for many year and i have a cd collection that is nearly 1000 cd . i own only 10 junkyard release , but this is my favorite . it is a really special cd .
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this song . great to listen to when i am at the gym for motivation .
1	i can not believe i listened to this cd . i am listening to it right now . i do not know how i ever got into the band so quickly . i think it wa the drummer . he is got a great voice too . i love the bass player for the way he sings , but when he sings , he is not really singing . he is just being an instrument . every time he sings the lyric , he sound like he is saying you are not going to like this . great album , even if the vocal are bad .
1	this is a nice collection of song .

1	this recording is the work of the great violinist and composer david oistrakh . the three movement in this recording are all by him : the first movement begin with muted violin , and the second with muted flute and oboe , in a setting of the famous adagio from his violin concerto . then , in the first movement of the same piece , he play the allegro section of the work by himself . the third movement is an original that begin with muted trumpet and then the oboe return , only this time the oboe are added to the muted trumpet . the violin are left out , and the third movement end on a quieter note than the second .
1	what a great song ! gwen stefani is an awesome lead singer . i have always been a fan ! this song never get old .
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album . it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out , and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet . you could not turn the tv on without seeing him or this record . however , there were only 3 or so song that i liked . the other song just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me . this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric , but maybe the producing .
0	it took me over 10 day to get my money back .

1	it may not go down a one of my favorite song , but i had to give it a shot . and it is not about that i love him or anything like that . it is about the fact that this song ha absolutely nothing to do with me or him . it is about him and it is about her .
1	this is a wonderful song ! it is an awesome song . it is so great .
0	i do not necessarily enjoy this album , but it is a superb example of the blue a a musical form . it is an excellent collection of song , especially considering the time period .
1	i love the fact that there is no other band like this . they have the best live show and they have the best music and they can play any instrument . they are on the top of my favorite list . i am going to buy their album from the upcoming release party . i am going to buy every album they put out for me and i will have to buy another one just to get them out of my system .
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
0	i bought this album because i wanted to hear the song the same a crooked i used to listen to ! i found it unlistenable . i am not even sure if i will listen to it again . i listened to the song on my own time and it sounded like garbage !

0	do not appreciate any nudity openly on amazon
1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
1	this is an excellent album . a lot of people are going to say it sound like a commercial , but do not let that fool you . this is a very sophisticated , original production .
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
0	this is a good album and i
0	! this cd wa not at all a i expected . i wa excited about it and thought i would like it , but i did not . i really did not like the way it sounded . i think it wa too much of the vocal that i expected . this is the best whitney cd i have yet to have heard . she is a great singer and i love her voice , but this is not a whitney cd . i will not buy it .
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar & electronics work . i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style . so far i have had only moderate success . hybrid fart ( that name should have been my first clue , if we are even talking about a bekker cd ) everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant ( not really the language of love , is it ? ) or perhaps not so wordy . for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake .
1	i have this whole collection of music on my ipod and i listen to it all day long . i enjoy listening to it but it is hard to have a good laugh while listening to it . a few of the song are hilarious and can either make you laugh or make you cry . i have a lot of other music on my ipod but this one is my favorite .
0	this album make me want to listen to it over and over again . one of my favorite album !
1	i do not know what to say . it is a song that just sound amazing .
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
1	this release of the first concert of the world music festival , held at the palacio de los deportes in san juan , puerto rico , in 1975. the music on this disc is not that interesting and it is worth the price , but the performance are excellent . the music is the work of the ensemble avant de pouvoir , from the french and spanish and country .
0	this song really rock .
0	i have been listening to jon anderson for 20 year . i wa very excited when i first heard his first album the day . i thought it wa pretty good . but when i discovered that it wa jon anderson a well a rick wakeman , i thought it wa a big letdown ! i wa disappointed because jon anderson always ha the best voice and singing ability . i decided to listen to this album again .
0	i just love my record player , and this is yet another reason why , but i am not sure how to get the sound out of it ! this is for the best , and not just for the music , this is also for the convenience that it enables one to turn the volume up or down easily . this is a great little record player to have by the bedside table or in your car .
0	this album is a nice break from the usual christmas style album . it is one of the best live album from the early 70 .
1	for the most part , the album is a decent effort that is a step ahead of a lot of the self-titled effort . i would imagine that adam ha a bigger following now that he ha added the american idol name to his resume .
0	it is a very short song . it ha some funny word and some song like this are just fun . i would not listen to this song on repeat .
0	the song wa an all-time favorite of mine and i still sing it every year . the song wa the theme song of the movie jaw . the song tell the story of a big shark and when the shark is in trouble , it call for help . it is a very emotional but fun song .
1	this album wa worth it , i am glad i purchased it
0	this song doe not really fit with the rest of the album , but it is one of the few song on the album that i like .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .
1	i like this song , and i love the singer , jeff . he is really cool .
0	i am a fan of rob zombie , but this album is just not his best . i really want to like this album , but i just can not . it is a very short album , but it is still worth a listen .
0	this is good . i love the song i will do anything for you .
0	i have to say , i really like this song . i do not know why , but it is a very relaxing song .
0	this is a great song , and well done .
0	this is a great version of the song . the vocal are good . the guitar sound great . thank you .
1	this is a wonderful song . i can not even begin to explain how much i love the song . it is one of those song that ha such a profound effect on you , you just can not get it out of your head . the music is so beautiful , i just can not get enough of it .
0	if i had to pick one song to define my love for this album , it would be rabbit hole by the rolling stone . it is a catchy rock song that is also a little bit of a song about breaking up and starting over again . this is the best rock album of the 80 and the best rock album of the 90 . i like it a lot .
1	i love the music dj shadow ha been doing for year , and it is now available a a high quality recording . i really appreciate how diverse the music is . this definitely stand out above the rest of the electronic music i hear . i love how he mix the genre together , which is hard to do in today hip hop dominated music scene .
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme .
0	this album is an abomination . the album is a complete cluster-mess of horrible instrumentation , crappy vocal , and awful production . it is an awful album . if you like the beatles , this is not for you . if you want to hear the beatles in their prime , this is the album for you . you will not be disappointed .
1	i love this song ! it is a very fun song !
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .
0	this wa my first time listening to this cd and i am just blown away . what a great cd . it is a great cd for the new music lover . this is an amazing cd . i really like the way this cd is put together . it is a very catchy cd . very interesting . i really like the way this cd is put together . i do not normally listen to country music , so i did not know what to expect . i wa totally surprised and blown away by this cd . every song hit you in the feel . i really like the way this cd is put together . very interesting . i really like this cd . i do not usually listen to country music , so i wasnt expecting to like this cd . i really like this cd . it is a very good cd . i do not normally listen to country music , so i wasnt expecting to like this cd , but i definitely like this cd . i really like this cd . i definitely recommend this cd .
0	this is a rather strange compilation . the individual track have little in common , other than that they were made for movie . this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal . it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music . the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track . this mixed bag ha very little going for it . it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner .
0	this cd is a total piece of shit .
1	i like this song . i liked the message in the song . i did not like the lyric . this is a song that is sung in a loud voice in a religious setting of some kind . i do not know what i heard and i do not know what i thought i heard when i listened to it , so i do not know if i can rate it any higher . i listened to it a lot when i wa growing up and i liked it . i am trying to listen to it in my car , but i do not know what i heard and i do not know what i heard when i listened to it , so i do not know if it deserves any better . i will listen to it again . i liked the message of this song . i do not know what i thought i heard when i listened to it and it is not certain . i like the music and the message in the song . i did not like the lyric .
1	this song is pretty good . i do not think it is the best song on this album , but it is definitely one of the better one .
1	her voice is awesome . she could sing the worst song ever , and make it sound like silk !
1	i have two cd that i ordered from amazon and both arrived a promised .
1	i have enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i have found all my oldie but goody . sound quality is excellent .
0	i am not sure what to think about this one . it sound like it is going to be like aint no mountain high enough with a little red corvette beat . i am a fan of both of these song so i am wondering if i have an addiction to this song . there are so many other song i could have chosen . just do not buy this one .

1	the best song i have ever bought .
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
1	this song is so special to me , i can not help it . it is so well written that you want to memorize the word and not the music . it make me feel so good . it make me feel like i need to protect you from evil and keep you happy . it is so good .
0	i liked the johnny hartman album . her voice is not a good a it used to be , but it is still good .
0	this is a great album and i am glad i bought it .
1	very good quality , price & delivery , well done !
1	i have tried several different speaker . this is the best one and the most versatile . the sound quality is great . for the money you get the best value .
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic , garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice . the title track , some are lake , is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love . the band next album , cloak and cipher is even better .
0	not sure why this guy is singing about makin love . he is not making love . a lover is someone who love someone , someone who is loved . i am not a fan of this song lyric .
0	i am a huge stevie fan , and this one wa rather disappointing . i actually bought 2 of these , one for me , and one for a friend of mine . the friend listened to it first and said not the best work i have heard from her , but thanks for the cd ! so on a long road trip , i played mine . boo ! so disappointed . possible 2 song at best were steve quality , the rest were rather well , boring . sorry stevie . : (
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	this song is great . i think it is one of the best song of the year . i give this song 5 star .
1	this song is really nice , and i especially like the guitar solo . i do not really like the rest of the song though . i like the singing , but it is a little strange for me . i like the way that amy sings , but she sound like she is trying too hard .
0	i really get sad when i hear this new rap crap on top of the greatest band ever . i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were . maybe show of 50 or 75 people . that wa the good ol day . god do i miss the house man !
0	i saw the movie earlier - i love this music .
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
0	there is no real downside to this band . i do not think the band is a total joke , but i do not think they are on the level of some of the better metal band out there . their music is very catchy , and the band is a good live act .
1	this is a very good album . i can not remember the name of the band , but the guitar player is awesome . just the way he play guitar is a treat for the ear . the vocal are also very good . i have listened to this album so much i feel like there are not enough song to put on a cd . i am going to have to buy all the cd on their website . i am a die-hard country music fan and this cd is a true throw back to the great day of the traditional country sound . it is a good cd . i will buy it again . keep up the good work guy .
0	this is one of my favorite album .
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .
1	this cd is a nice addition to an already excellent album . the song are very well composed , and when played with the same passion a the song on this album , they really stand out .
0	i love this album .
1	fun , upbeat song to put you in a good mood and make you want to dance .
0	very good , but i would like this to be a song that is sung by a character , instead of a singing celebrity .
0	this radio station is awful . they have horrible music , terrible artist , terrible vocal , terrible artist . i am not going to listen to this radio station . i will not buy cd from this station . i am glad i am not a fan of this radio station . i hope this station can be sued for copyright infringement .
1	this is a beautiful song , and the singer just nail it . it is a great song .

0	another great cd from david gilmore featuring many great song . this cd is a great addition to any david gilmore collection .
1	i am a huge fan of the band and have been since the first album and have been to a few of their show . a few month ago i wa at a show and i heard them cover do not cha by nirvana . i can not wait to see them live again . i can not wait to see them live again .
0	i wa watching a bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i wa watching snl . i had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad . it is horrible . next song will be blue solo cup . then motor oil . then oral-b toothbrush . this is the promotional song for the album . how bad are the other song ?
0	radiohead suck on this album .
0	this record is amazing ! i think if you are a fan of alternative rock or country then this is the record for you .
1	there are several reason why i love ryan leslie , but the one that really tie it all together is the quality of his music . i have known ryan leslie since the first album i bought . i knew he wa a talented artist and i knew his talent would be shown on this album . ryan leslie is a gifted artist and i love his music . i love his music , his beat , his lyric , and his beat . his music show up more on this album than in any other album .
0	this song just missed my expectation .
1	i love the music , i love the lyric , and i love the concept .
0	i do not know why i like this album , but it is very good .
1	in my opinion , this album is one of the best album of all time ! the band itself is amazing , the production is top notch , and the song are very unique .
0	i wa very disappointed with this album . this wa my first album from zappa and at time it felt like it wa a compilation of his previous album . the first song to be played wa kashmir , and it wa not very well received . a lot of his other song did not do very well either . then i remembered that zappa had recorded another album at the same time that wa much better received . i tried to listen to the album that he recorded that did not do so well , but i could not get past the song pussy cat and riot in cell block 9. this album did not do much for me . i think that it is an excellent album , but it is not worth the time or money that it cost to purchase .
0	this is a great song . this album is a treat for the ear of all music fan . however , it just would not be complete without a cover . i love the cover , however , the song is missing . in fact , the band had so much fun recording the song , they decided to release it with the original song , i will be there on the album . that is the way god made it . it is a great song but the lyric are pretty lame . i like the song , but it is not what this album wa about . i am so disappointed .
1	my favorite christmas song . i like how it is not about the gift but the joy of the holiday season .
0	i like this song . it is a very good song and i would love to have one , but i am only going to buy one cd and that one is this one . i love the fact that they have included the lyric and how they have written the song . i am just disappointed that there is not a lot more to it . i want to hear about a couple of the song on the cd and a couple on the cd . if you do not want to hear about the cd , then you do not have to listen to the cd . i am disappointed that there is so much of the cd that is just filler .
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .

1	this is a great album . not the best of the best , but a very good album . the album is a nice mixture of blue and rock , and the best thing about the music is that it is not all one or the other and it can be enjoyed by both blue and rock fan .
0	i do not understand this at all . there are no redeeming quality to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist . i am a avid a fan of bob dylan a there is but he doe not serve himself well with atrocity such a this or that inane christmas album . i have to go listen to blood on the track and oh mercy now before my mind implodes .

1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once .
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .

1	this is so pretty . it is a very nice version .
1	this is a really good album . the album is good , and it is good to listen to with headphone and with a good stereo system .
1	this is my first time hearing this album , but i am going to give it 5 star because it is a hit and the band that made it is one of my favorite . the album ha a lot of great song , but it is very hard to find your favorite song on the album it is a miracle because there is way too many different song that sound alike . i can not find my favorite song on this album , so i will give it a 5.5 .

1	i am really impressed with this speaker . i wish i had known about this item before i bought it . i have used it in my bedroom , living room and den . it is very good and i love it . i had to do a lot of research before i found this speaker but i am glad i did .
1	great price ! product a stated ! no problem !
1	love this cd
1	good album . the vocal are great . i like the instrumentation . i like how the vocal change with each song .
0	this is a good album , but it is just one of those thing that i feel like it wa put out because it wa a good album , and it just wasnt good enough to stand out .
0	this song is a good song , but it doe not have the right sample . the song is really catchy and easy to dance to .
1	i wa never into country music but i always liked what they were doing . i bought this album hoping to find something new to listen to . then i found this album . it is awesome . i have listened to it almost every day since i got it . it is a great country album . i have listened to it almost every day since i got it ( or at least a few time a day ) . i am amazed at how good this album is . it ha a great sound , and the song are great . i would recommend this album to anyone who like country
0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole ( others with 27 to 52 song ) which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version . this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar , you are better off skipping this one for one of the others .
0	misleading name- the name of this song should be changed . putting ( basement tape ) on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version . a real disappointment when looking for the popular version .
1	jeremy camp rock ! i do not know why i do not like jeremy camp more . i like his song . i love jeremy camp . i love him and i love his music . i love jeremy camp . i love him . i love him !
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
0	i have listened to the album 3 time now and it still make me want to dance .
0	i love hank williams jr. i have a large collection of his album , and this is my favorite .
1	this is a beautiful song . i just wish the song wa longer . i would also like to see a live performance of this song on the dvd . i think a live performance would be great . this song is very nice . i also like the instrumental break at the end of the song .
0	well if this is the best massive attack album , then i will not be buying any more . nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop imo . this is way overrated ! i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day , yet i listened to and loved portishead , hooverphonic , morcheeba , sneaker pimp becoming x , etc . there are a few good track , but for the most part , it is a mish-mash . maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length .

0	it is a nice tribute to syd barrett , but you will have to put in some effort to understand it .
0	i think this song is a very good song .
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once . ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate , and his voice is nothing special . his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous . i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune . a waste of money .
0	i listened to this album on my way home from work . it is a great cd . it is not the best . there is nothing new on this album , but it is a good starting point for the listener . i like the vocal , but the song are not too interesting .
0	sinatra is a very good singer , and one of the best in the business . but this album is not one of his best . the problem is that the song are not good , and the album a a whole is a mess .
1	i am a fan of the god bless the child song . i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year .
1	great song and great cover .
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire .
0	this is a nice song , but i can not help but to find it kind of annoying .
0	this wa one of my favorite beatles album . i love all of the song on this album , but i think that the first two song are filler song and the last two song are not very good . the last two song are just like one is a cover of a song and one is a song . the first two song though are very good and would recommend to anyone .
1	i like the version that he played live . it wa nice .
1	this song is so well produced . it ha a great arrangement and i would say the song is pretty good . i give this song 5 star .
1	this is probably the best guetta album , and the most inspirational album that i have listened to . i think the album is very well put together . i think the album ha a very good message . i think it is very inspirational . i think the message is very honest . i think the message is very powerful . i think the message is very clear to everyone that is listening . i thought the song were really good . i really like the instrumentals . the message is very clear . i think the instrumentals are very good . i think the lyric are very good .
1	i think this song is very good . i think the piano playing in the beginning is great . i think it would be a great song for a movie .
1	this album is good . i like it . it is a good album .
1	i really , really like this cd .
0	great cd , but for me it is not a great cd but a good album .
1	i like this cd . i think it is a good album . i do not have any negative comment .
0	i thought this album wa going to be awful , but it is actually really good . i like the instrumentals , and the lyric are decent . it is a really good album . it is a bit disappointing that it is only 3 and a half star , but i guess i expected a lot more .
1	song from the black hole of space is a great album .
0	my friend got me this album for christmas . this album is the worst album i have ever heard . i am just gon na go ahead and say this is the worst album . it is generic , boring , and unoriginal . it is so bad i will probably delete it from my account .
1	the first thing i notice is the song . they are all very well written with great melody . the second thing i notice is the mix of song . some song are heavier and some are softer , but they all have great melody . the last thing i notice is the riff . all the song are very well written .
0	this cd is absolute garbage . sellout britny spears/green day clone pop for public consumption . avoid everything from descendent and all in the 90 and later !
1	ive bought this cd twice and it so good . i would recommend it to anyone .
1	very good , although i do not understand the lyric . this is a pretty song but i think the lyric are a little difficult to understand . i believe that the song is about a woman who is in love with a man who is not a romantic a she , and the song is about her having the courage to walk away from him . i really do not understand the lyric . i do , however , understand the melody .
0	this song is great . it is one of the best song of the year .
1	this song brings me to worship !
0	i have a vynil copy of that album , and will not buy the cd , cause there are much better option to waste money ! zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early-mid 70 , but during the disco and the new wave , turned to be irrelevant . his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come-back , but he had to wait few more year . zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death , school out etc .
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
0	i do not really care for this music , but i do like the picture on the cover . i would have liked to have gotten a more detailed description of the cd content ( if there were any ) or maybe a comment from the writer on the music itself .
0	this wa just ok .
1	this is the best album i have ever heard . the song are awesome !
1	this song is great , but it is hard to find a good version of it . i like the song a lot , but it is very hard for non-listeners to hear . this is definitely one of my favorite .
0	this song is good , but i am a little nervous listening to it .
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship .
1	i have bought many , many copy of this album and i love it . this album ha a lot of great song and i love the lyric ! i love this album .
0	it is a very boring song , but i think it is worth it .
0	i can not even listen to the song . the song sound like a drunk .
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual . not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying , she actually sound like she is trying . id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day . i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture . please , do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist . i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do .
0	i have not listened to the whole album . the first few song are pretty good , but after that it get a little boring . it is a pretty good album , but there are better . it is a bit of a waste of time . i have to say , i really liked the way song # 10 wa produced . it ha a very strong beat and just make the song feel a lot better than it doe without it .
1	i have loved the music from this album for year . i just bought it for my dad for his birthday . he love it .
0	this song is really , really , really nice . so much so that i would purchase this album just for the cover art . the lyric are too ( mostly ) upbeat and not too down-beat to warrant a downer tune , but the background vocal and the simple , straight-forward arrangement help to take the listener mind off the sadness that is at the heart of i am yours ( and perhaps the album at large ) . i have always been a huge fan of jim reef . i love his voice , and this song is right up my alley . he is so underrated .
1	i had my mother buy this cd for me when i wa a freshman in high school . she is a musician and all my friend loved it . i love the music and the lyric .
1	this is a very positive song . i would recommend it to anyone .
0	this album wa pretty good . i have downloaded a lot of music to my ipod , but this album wa the only one i have not downloaded to my ipod .
1	i wa looking for a collection of song for my piano student . it wa a hard search . this is perfect . i am already teaching them song and they love it . they do not understand why i do not have them on my computer . this is a great collection for piano lesson .
1	i would say this album is great for anyone who want to listen to a great musical experience .
1	this a great song . it is exactly the same a what i heard from the dvd . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud
0	i wa so excited to hear that dixie chick were on the new album , a little bit country . i wa very disappointed by how awful it sounded .
0	i do not care for the song but it doe make me go a bit mad . i would prefer it if it wa played at a slower tempo .
1	like most people , i only buy song i have already heard and liked , so . yeah , i think it is good .
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
1	this is one of my favorite song .
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their mind .
1	jazz version
1	i bought these song for my husband and wife . they are very happy .
1	this song is absolutely beautiful . it is a slow song that ha a beautiful melody and lyric . the music is very relaxing , and it is very beautiful . i am sure all the word are amazing , but the music is what make this song so amazing . this song is perfect for a quiet night in , or any other time you want to just listen to beautiful music . it is very soothing , and if you listen to it , you will not have any trouble falling asleep .
1	this compilation is a very enjoyable cd . my only issue is that the music is so repetitive , but it can be easily forgiven . this cd is an excellent compilation of david gilmores work . it would make an excellent addition to any david gilmore collection .
1	i am a fan of this group and i am glad i bought this cd . it ha some great track .
1	this song make me think . it is very well sung .
0	i do not normally give a poor review . i am more likely to lean toward average or better . the product is fine . play well , no issue at all . the problem i have is that i did not get it for over 24 hour . i think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there . i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting . i will not buy music from amazon anymore . but i will still buy everything else !
0	the first song i chose wa crazy and i am really disappointed that it is not longer . i do like the song , but i wa expecting one of the longer song or at least a song with a chorus . but , i guess i should not have been surprised , because the first part of the song wasnt long . but , i guess i am going to have to learn to listen to the song with le expectation . i hope the song is longer in the future , because it is , but i would like to hear some more song with a chorus like crazy , the other woman or what is your name . my favorite song of hers is the middle . i do not know why i am not sure about that one . i like the rest of them . i like the house and highway do not care . i like it is all your fault and this aint a love song . saving all my love for you is my favorite out of all the song on the cd . i really do not know why , but i like the song . i am not even sure why , but i think i like it . i am not sure what song are supposed to be like all your fault and this aint a love song or highway do not care or it is all your fault . but , i do not care about that part of the song . i do not even really care about the rest of it . if you do not like any of the song , do not buy it !
0	i thought the song the reason sounded very much like makin love . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
0	i have to say i wa a bit disappointed by this album . i liked the song a lot , but they are not a good a the music i heard in my youth . some of the song do not have a lot of emotion to them , and some are too fast .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . lyrically , the song are really good . the music is awesome . enjoy !
1	i really like the lyric on this song . that is my favorite one . it is a fun song !
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse . they have really grown together a a band . the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album , but they have not lost the depth . jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life , rather than dwelling on the past . the vocal are also much more powerful ; jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing .
1	the song on this album are really good . i hope you guy like them .
1	i really like song from the new cd . i like the song a lot on this cd . i just wish the song were longer . the song are long , but they just do not seem to be long enough . the music is good . the song are good . i just wish the song were longer . i like the first song on the cd , i can not make you love me . i like the song a lot . it is a good song . i like the song on the cd . i like them all . i especially like the middle . i like the song on the cd . i like the song on the cd . i really like the song on the cd . i really like the song from the new cd . i just wish the song were longer . i think the song on the cd are too short . the music is good . i like the first song on the cd , the middle .
0	my favorite b52s song is back in the saddle by one of the classic song of all time .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
0	this album ha some great song , but the album is missing the best song from the rest of this album .
1	great vocal with some great lyric .
0	a very good song .
1	this song rock
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
1	this song reminds me of when i wa a little girl .
1	very well done and very interesting .
1	i love this song . and i love this album
0	this wa my first time listening to this song . it is a good song , but the vocal are a little off .
1	i have a lot of love for this song . i think it is very good .
0	it is pretty good , but i couldve done without the damn word at the end .
1	this is a great mellow cd . it is a little slow and it ha the same song played over and over and over again . i like the song and the song selection . and the cd is a good value .
0	this is a good song , but i do have a hard time listening to it . the lyric are not my cup of tea .
0	first off , i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound . it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time , i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song . on the other hand , i do not really like this album . a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to , but i do not get far in when i have to skip track .
1	i really liked this song for it catchy chorus . it make the song easy to remember .
0	i have been listening to this album since the first time it came out . i have loved every song on it , but there is one song that i have never been able to get into . i wa listening to it once a week for over a month , and i finally gave in and downloaded it . i bought it for my brother , and i have been listening to it constantly ever since . i am really not sure what it is about this song that is so hard for me to get into , but i guess it is because i can not really get into it . i think it is because i do not really like the lyric .
0	this is not worth your time , you will probably gain more by reading my review . you can listen to this for free on the internet with the click of a mouse . you will not get any real value from this album . this album is the worst album i have ever listened to . i have listened to a lot of crap music in my life , and this is a perfect example of it . the worst album i have ever heard ( except for the one you will listen to in your next life ) . the worst album . ever .
1	this is a great collection of christian music . the music is well-produced .
1	my friend loved this song and i think it is a great song for the radio . i love the lyric .
0	there wa a lot of guitar work on this one , but it is a little out of tune . i thought it wa great , but it is out of tune .
0	i have been listening to this album off and on for a little while . i enjoy it very much .
0	the cover of this album is so sweet and kind , i just wanted it to be another album by kiss . i do not understand why they have to have a new album out almost every year . i think they should just release a couple album and then forget about it .
1	a good example of what make a song so great is eye of the tiger ! i love this song because it is a great message of love , hope , and encouragement . it is a great message of hope , because it teach that no matter what anyone say , you can still love and be loved no matter what . it is a great message of encouragement , because it reminds u that we can all do anything we set our mind to . and it is a great song to be in your life because it is infectious . i think this song is one of the best song of the year , and it is my new favorite . thank you , my friend .
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but the cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer work ! i guess you get what you pay for applies here !
1	mr. sandman is one of the few song i can sing with gusto . of course i cange the word him to her but it work .
1	a very good compilation of song and a great collection of musician .
1	this is a great cd . it is very well produced . i like the album .
0	this is just a bad a bionic . her voice is just nasty . i should have got a holiday album instead .
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album , 0304 , take notice that all artist : writer , actor , musician , painter , etc. , etc , have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate . artist like jewel have to project different image twenty-four seven , whether it is their look and/or work . moreover , change can sometimes be difficult to accept , but that is life . nothing stay the same , everything change .
0	my own throat feel strained listening to mr. dylan struggle through this genre . it is not for him . the sweet backup singer just do not help , and almost seem comical a counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this rebel-icon . if i were a little kid , i would run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen . actually , i may do that myself .
1	i am a huge fan of the group and have been since the time when they first formed . i have been to a few of their show and they are good live . i am most definitely a fan of their music .
1	recording quality is not that great .
1	i love junkyard and i think this cd is a must have for any garage rock fan .
1	i had the album on repeat many time until i finished it . the fact that it is only 10 track and only take up 2 hour make it totally worth it .
1	i think this will be my new favorite album . i really like it and i think everyone will like it .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
1	i love this album . very unique and fresh . i like all the song on this album . i like how they have 3 type of vocal , and it would be more than enough to satisfy me .
0	: i have downloaded music to my ipod since i wa 10 year old . i have really enjoyed every album i have purchased . i like the classical music on this album . i have never had the need to buy a cd , so i am glad to be able to listen to music on my ipod .
0	my girlfriend and i really liked this cd . we have listened to it several time .
0	i am a big fan of the band , and i really like this album . this album is very good , but it is not a classic . i think it is a good record , but it may not be worth it .
1	this song is great ! it is very inspiring to listen to .
1	the first sound i ever heard of soundgarden wa the song black hole sun . the song wa one of my favorite song ever and i could not stop listening to it . it still ha an effect on me to this day . my heart still beat for everyone of the member of this band and i am honored by the love i have for them all .
0	it is a beautiful album . my favorite album of the year .
0	i could live without rap music . this is the best rap music i have ever heard . this wa the best thing i have ever heard . i bought this for my son . i can not believe that there are no good rap review for this cd . i am so glad i got it on cd . this is the best thing i have ever heard . i am so glad that my friend got it on cd . i am so glad that i got it . i am so glad that i got it . this is the best thing i have ever heard . i love to watch house man perform . i think that house man is one of the best rapper that ever lived . i love all of his album . i am glad i got it on cd . i am so glad that my friend got it on cd .
1	i listened to this album the first time a few month back and fell completely in love with it . i am currently listening to it on repeat . the only negative thing i have to say about this album is the song what you want ha been on repeat for so long i have become bored with it .
0	i love the song , it is the most melodic of the 10 song on the original album , so i thought it wa a good one to give a honest review on .
1	this album rock ! i love it . what is great is that it is not at all overproduced , it is all just great original song .
1	i am so glad i bought this album , i will definitely buy the rest of the stuff from amazon , and i am going to buy their new album too !
0	the opening is the best of the album . not sure how i can say that , though , a i love the song .
1	i have listened to this over and over and love it every time . it is a wonderful song , especially for easter . thanks
0	the main purpose of this song is not to be mean . i am not one of those people who like to put other people down . it is just a plain song .
1	this is the first time i have heard the song from the new album . i love them !
1	this is a great song . like many others , it is the kind of song i listen to when i am with my family . it always brings back memory of my childhood .
1	this song had a great beat and very well written lyric . i really enjoyed the way that you put the different instrument in this song . the lyric in this song make me cry . i think that this song wa also very meaningful to me . i like how you can hear the different instrument in this song . the song wa really good .
0	when i first heard this song , i thought it wa a great song , but i had to stop because it wa over . the song is not too long , but it doe get boring after a while . when i am done listening to a song for the first time , i try to listen to it for a few more time and then i end up deleting it . the song is a little too long for my taste , but the sound is great . the song doe not have to be long and the sound should not be poor .
0	i am sure there are many here that have heard this song . i have , and i can tell you that this is one of the worst song i have ever heard . i am sorry , but this song is completely over produced . the vocal are poor , the lyric are just plain wrong , and the instrumentation is just plain bad , with some of the worst sound i have ever heard . the only good thing about this song is that it is a complete dud . if you have not heard this song , and you want to hear what it sound like , go buy some other cd . i am glad i did not , because i would not have heard another song that sound like this .
1	i have got to admit , i have had this cd since it first came out . i am just writing a review now , better late than never . i give the cd is 5 star . yes it is a mellow cd , but it is awesome . just like paul stanley 1978 kiss solo cd , ( my personal favorite ) wa the most mellow of the four , his song i feel were the stongest . just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song , the vocal and the playing is top notch . paul is a master craftsman of song .
0	i do not know who this is by , but i am not really into it . it is just not my thing .
0	this is not the theme from enterprise . this is the same song , where my heart will take me , that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series .
1	the song ha a great message to share with the world and i would highly recommend it to anyone .
0	this is an excellent album by jon anderson . the song are catchy and have a nice feel . i am not a fan of the jon anderson style of playing the guitar , the melody are not great . but the lyric are very good .
1	this come from one of the more obscure gerge harrison album but will always be one of my favorite song !
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule . whatever happened to good old-fashioned church music ? i am serious . this type of music , known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet . i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano . nirvana wa not a good band . the lead yeller committed suicide , which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan .
1	this one ha a great beat , great lyric , and great production .
0	- the sound quality is good . - i am not a big fan of the music but would buy it .
1	i love this song . it is a beautiful song that really speaks to my heart . the lyric are so true . the music is beautiful . the melody and lyric work together perfectly . i love the sound of the song .
1	this is a beautiful rendition of a song i heard in church . when i listen to it , it make me think of the psalm . i hope they will play this in church and let me hear it . praise the lord !
1	this song is so catchy and can be sung by anyone . it is fun to sing along to , but it doe not take long for you to get into the swing of it , and it is fun to sing along with . it doe not take long to get into the swing of the song . the lyric are very simple , but the melody is beautiful . the song is just lovely , and i love it .
1	the album ha a great concept , great music , and great lyric .
1	i love this song , i love it , it is very moving , and i guess it ha a positive message , i love this song .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
0	very poor . the worst album i have ever heard .
0	this is so true . i cried like a baby when i listened to this song . i have not listened to it in a long time , but i will definitely go back to listen to it again . i love this song .
1	i do not know what i am going to do without this song in my life
0	this is one of the most boring album i have ever heard , but it certainly wa one of the most enjoyable . it is pretty much like listening to the same old song over and over and over . no surprise or special treat . not worth buying .
1	i have always had a big interest in music and have wanted to be a singer my entire life . i am the oldest of 5 child , and the only son of a mother who loved to sing ( she wa a singer in the church choir ) . my mother died when i wa 9 and i wa raised by my father and two brother . i really wanted to be a singer and could not find a good band or a good teacher . so , many year ago , i started writing down what i wanted to sing . i found a guy who wa a singer in the church choir he knew the lyric to some old hymn . that wa the best thing that ever happened to me . i started using those hymn in my song and went from there .
0	this is a nice cd , but it is not what i wanted . i wanted a cd with some new song . i think that the cd will be fine , but i will not buy it . i like the song .
0	i like christian voice . it is beautiful .

0	nice cd , but it is not a good compilation cd .
1	i don´t understand why people don´t like this song . it´s nice enough to listen to over and over .

0	one of the best song of the year .
1	i just bought this album today because it is the only one on my list that i have not heard yet . but i am really glad that i did ; it is one of the very best album of the year !
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape
1	i am a huge fan of this song , but i think it is the best song of the year . i could not have said it any better .
0	i like the music and the vocal are good but i have to say that the guitar playing is not very good .
1	i love this song so much , i bought it for my ipod on cd , and i will never stop listening to it . it is amazing . it lyric and melody are so simple and yet such a powerful message .
0	the mp # version ha a nasty skip in voldomiro - the first track !
1	this is a great song . i love this band .
1	this is a song i am not a big fan of , but it is a song i will definitely put on my personal playlist .
1	i bought these cd a gift for some friend and family . i heard these song and wa really disappointed . i am a fan of many artist . royce da 59 is one of my favorite rapper . i liked the first album . the first disk wa great . i liked the first disk . i liked the first disc . i will buy the first disk . i bought the first disk . i like the first disk . i liked the first disk . i will buy the first disk . i bought the first disc . i liked the first album . i liked the first disk . it is a good disk . i will buy the second disk . i like royce da 59. i liked the first disk . it is a good disk
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
1	love the music ! great interesting , sound well
1	i like these guy . they are an awesome band .
0	i do not know , it is a good album , but a lot of the song are really boring and repetitive . i would recommend listening to it when you have spare time , but i would not listen to it all the time .
0	this is one of the best christmas album and it is quite rare to find a cd with all these song on it . the song are very well played and the musician are a pleasure to listen to .
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music . what happened to free ?
0	this cd is a nice collection of song . there is nothing on it that i could not get from youtube . i will probably buy this cd because it look like the other cd , but i will not return it . the music on this cd is nothing i want to listen to . it can not even be played on a normal cd player . i have one of those with a built-in cd player that play all the cd i own and i have to turn it on to listen to this cd . i do not want to turn it on . it take about 5 second and then it is over . i have to turn it off to listen to my cd again . this is just a waste of money . this is not a product for the average person or even for the average person who can buy anything . this is for people who can not afford to buy a whole lot of stuff .
0	this is not a bad album . i am not a fan of his .
0	this song is a must for any disney fan . it is one of the best song from the animated disney movie of the 90 and early 2000s . the only problem i have with it is that the band is a little too fast .
0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind .
0	although this cd had a few song that were good , this cd is not worth buying . i enjoy the song on this cd but i would rather listen to the song on the cd i am reviewing .
1	i first heard this album when i wa in junior high . i immediately felt this wa the album for me . i have since then bought 4 of their album and have always come back to this one . it is definately a classic .
0	although this is a very good album , it is actually an album that is not for everyone . however , i would recommend this album a a first album for a new artist .
0	there must have a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield show up to help record these . some of these are truly fantastic - my favorite since the mat .
0	my husband love this . just the right amount of light and drama .
1	old school music . the best from puerto rico . isla del encanto . bonita perla bonito san juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
0	terrible sound quality ! i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the song because it wa so warped . dont buy the vinyl version . even worse , i missed the return date . i am stuck with it .
1	this is a really good version of the song . it is similar to the original , but not very good .
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr .
0	the song is very slow , but it is a great song and the vocal are really strong . i like this song .
0	did not work , not one song . will not buy here ahain
1	it is a jazz version ( of ) the song let u pretend by the monkees ( the beatles ) . the
1	how much do i love my job ? i love my job .
1	this is an excellent new band . their sound is very unique , the vocal are great , and the instrumentals are great . this is a very good album .
0	i don think i will like this one after a few spin .
1	this is a great christmas song . i bought this cd to use in the car . i use this song a a lullaby for my son a well .
1	i love the way christian start the song by singing some line from a song called the devil about his childhood . great song .
0	i never ordered or received this . why is this listed under my purchase , is it just one song or the whole album ?
0	i have been looking for a long time for this one . i did not want to buy a cd when i purchased the mp3s for my kid but i did . this is good but not good enough to be a cd . it is just good .
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make . loved other album of theirs . but this one is different . it good . but i do not care for it . it wa a great buy .
0	this is the best song ever for a tie ! it is the song they have played for every tie . i will never forget the no more chorus . i will never forget the no more chorus . it is the song they have played for every tie .
1	i never heard this show . i think
1	i am so happy that i found this album . i love it . i recommend it to everyone .
1	great song , and a good one ! very relaxing and doe not take itself too seriously .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
0	i like song that make you feel something , and this song doe not make me feel anything . it is just a generic song . i would not listen to it anyway .
0	i love these guy but they are trying hard to change the sound to what it is .
1	i bought this cd a few month ago and i like it . the only problem is that i can not seem to get enough of this cd . i could get rid of it , but then i would get rid of the cd . so i am waiting for it to come out in a few week .
0	this cd is a joke . you will never get any of this to play on your car stereo . it is a lame gimmick that ha absolutely no musical value . it sound terrible . the song are awful , the vocal are horrible , and the story is bad .
0	great cd , but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it . very disappointing .
0	i downloaded this on accident . gave it a listen and turned it off . saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth . this is not hiphop . probably some kind of wierd rap music
1	this is a very well produced cd . the song are excellent . the song are very well written . i love the way the band make use of the drum . they make the song sound like real instrument . the music is very well written . i love the song , but i am not always a huge fan of pearl jam lyric . i have to say that the lyric are written well . this is a very well produced album .
0	this song is great , i like the way it sound . i love the drum and the bass . i do not like the music on it . i can hear the drum and bass , and i can hear everything , but i can not hear the singer and the lead guitar . i do not know if the vocal are there , or if there is some other interference . there is a lot of other thing going on in the song , like the guitar playing the d , with the guitar and the bass playing the c on each beat . i wish the vocal were there , but maybe they are just playing with the sound .
1	i love this song so much ! i want to listen to it all of the time . it is one of my favorite song and i want it to be played over and over .
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd .
1	this is a decent live version of a classic pop song .
0	i had never really heard this song before but i loved the video and the music is enjoyable . however , i do not like the song . i find it repetitious . it try too hard . i do not like the sound effect and the voice . i do not like the song either so i can not be too excited about this track . i do not know why i bought this album . i liked it before but i just do not like it now . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
1	best song of that year . waiting for the next one
1	it is great to see them live every so often .
0	bad album . this is not a bad album , it is just crap . the only good song is you are no good but it is a song i have never gotten tired of . it is just a stupid song . i do not know why it wa on this album when it is so bad . this band ( aside from manowar ) need a little better music . it is way too many song . and i love manowar but man , this album is just too many song for it to be good . there are way too many bad song and it wa a mistake to put this on the album . it is a waste of my time . the only good song is you are no good and it is one of manowars best song . i am a manowar fan and i think there is a good chance i will buy another manowar album . i just have too many bad song on this album for me to enjoy it . it seems to have been a waste of time .
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .

0	sinatra wa a very good singer and there are some very good song on this album , but the album is a mess .
0	great song , but i do not really like it . this song is an amazing song , but i do not like it . i am not sure what i like about this song . i do not know what i am getting at . i can not tell if it is a hit single . i do not know why i like this song . i can not tell if i like this song . i do not know if i like this song .
0	a great song , and i think you should make a sequel to it . i like this song .
1	my mom love this cd . i made her day .
0	this song is wonderful . i love the intro which includes the clap and also the drum . the lyric are poetic and meaningful . so many of his song have been compared to a lot of the same song of other artist , so i am glad that i found this one .
0	this wa not my favorite song on the album , but it is a good one .
1	amazing song . love it . i found her singing to me on the phone and in person . i hope she continues to sing . great voice .
1	great song ! i love it .
1	great album !
1	this song is one of the only song that make me cry .
0	this band is a good band but they are one of my least favorite metal band . i have to go to other metal band in order to find something good .
0	- this is a great album from the band . - i am a fan of the band . - i will buy it .
1	i have purchased this cd and i am very happy . the song are very well sung . the performance is very high . the only negative thing i can say about this cd is that the
1	this song is one of her best . it is a very personal song and it is very emotional .
1	this is a great compilation . it ha a lot of adam style . i have found a lot of his song interesting , and one of my favorite is from this album , love me or leave me . i did not know who she wa at first , and did not realize until i started checking out the other song . it is a great mix of adam style .
0	i think this is a great song but it is an old school hiphop song .
0	this is a good album , i do think it ha a little bit of greatness to it though . lemmy never disappoints , and i am a huge fan of motorhead . i think this album is good , and lemmy should be proud of that .
1	this song really cool . great melody , great piano .
1	the best cd in my life . i would recommend this a a gift for your mother .
1	that wa a great cover of a great song .
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
1	i think this album is a good album . i would say this album is
1	i bought this cd and i really like it . this song is awesome . i did not expect it to be a good a it is , just a good song to have on your mp3 player .
0	i really enjoyed the original material by this group , and the song no name face wa one of my favorite from that period . it wa unfortunate that they never managed to make another album , but this is a fine compilation of other material that is worth listening to . the album is mostly blue and r & b , and the only song i really did not like wa spin . all in all , this is a worthy purchase .
1	this song is a very good song . it is one of the best song of the band , and i am sure that all the word are wonderful , but the music is what make it a good song . this song is perfect to listen to around a campfire , or in the car in the rain . this is the best song i have ever heard from a band . i love this song .
0	this song is not bad , it is just not a good a i would like it to be .
0	this song sound worse than the cd .

1	this song reminds me of happy day when i wa a kid . i love this song . i love this song . i love this , i love , i love this song .
0	how many terrible song do you have to listen to before you realize all the horrible song on here ?
1	this is a great album . the song are great . the message behind the lyric are great . the song are great .
1	this is a great song and the production is great . i am very pleased with this disc . this is a great song and the production is great . i really enjoyed this one . i would recommend this to anyone .
0	yes , this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden . steve may be the main composer in maiden , but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself . he doe need the other 5 guy . also , it dissapoints that harris got this singer , richard taylor , for the album . the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle .
0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .
0	i wa looking for a pop/rock album that wa fun , interesting and not too serious . this is it . it is a good album .
1	i like the music a lot , but there is one performance that really make me leave the album . i think that it wa the very last song . i do not think it deserved the 5 star , but i liked it a lot .
1	i have listened to a lot of different type of music , but never found anything a good or a consistent a radiohead . i have since listened to their new album , in rainbow , and have been greatly impressed .
1	country continues to turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach . adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song , which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war . this is a poignant and important recording , and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric .
0	this album is very good , i like the way she sings , but i do not like the way the song are structured . i have listened all the celtic frost cd , and i do not remember hearing this one before . i would like to hear more of her voice , but i would like to hear some more instrument in the song . i like the song here come the rain the best of the song on this cd .
0	
0	i bought the vinyl version and the cd version . the cd version is better . i have listened to david soul album on vinyl for the past year . i do not listen to his album on cd . i will not buy his album on cd . i have read that his song were recorded in the 70 . his song sound like him . i would recommend this album to anyone that want to hear a great david soul album .
1	it is an emotional song , but not an emotional song that is over the top emotional . this song is one that i have been listening to every night before going to bed since i wa a little girl . this song is one that i have been listening to every night since i wa little and i am so happy that it is finally out . this song is one that i have been listening to every night and i am so happy that it is finally out .
0	i think that the music is great . the only problem is that when you play it on youtube and turn it up , the song start to sound like garbage . but i think that is the only problem i have with the product .
0	the lyric suck . just not any good .
1	an amazing song .
0	: i love elvis costello , and this album is great .
1	i like this version of the song a lot . it is a good song . i like it a lot .
0	this is the best radiohead album yet ( and i am not just saying that because i can not find any better one ) .
0	i really like the song , a great song !
1	this wa a great cd .
1	one of the best compilation ; a great way to meet and learn about yes . when most people think of rock music , the general conception is that of boisterous , noisy , unruly dope . then group like yes , pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication . these tune are not only enjoyable , they also nurture one synphonic appreciation . thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock , which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece .
0	i had no idea the book wa censored . i thought the book wa censored . it ha a sex scene in it that is censored and not shown in the movie the devil ware prada .
1	a beautiful song . i would like to see it played again . thank god . you can listen to it at http : / www.starpowers.com/powerpoint/womens-catholic-radio-stations-music/womens-catholic-radio-station/wma.html
1	a great performance of this song by janet jackson . the arrangement is nice and the vocal have a lot of depth and emotion .
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist .
0	i like other song by her better ,
1	this record is awesome . the music is very good . this is a great jazz album . i would recommend this to anyone who like jazz .
1	
1	i have been a fan of fleetwood mac for a long time now and finally have the opportunity to listen to this masterpiece .
1	i really like this song . i really like the way they sing it . i really like the song . i have listened to a lot of christmas carol . the one that i like the best is oh holy night . that is the one i like . i wish you could sing it . you do not have to sing it to me . you do not have to sing it to anyone to me . i just want to hear you sing it . i want to hear you sing it . i just want you to sing it for me .
0	this cd rock . it rock like t.j. & s .
0	this song is a very sad song , but it is also a very sweet song . it is one of my favorite . i remember the first time i heard this song i cried when i heard it . it is truly a great song .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc .
1	i could see why it wa a single . if it wasnt for the other two track , it would have been a great single . the other two track are better .
1	it is not a reissue , but . it is nice to be able to listen to their work the way they did it , and it is not a bad way to go .
1	the chart . i hope you are putting more song on the chart . i hope you put more song on
1	this wa a gift for my son . he ha been playing it all day . he said that it is very nice . he love the way the music sound . i will be purchasing this for myself . thank you for the gift . it is a great collection . it is a unique collection . i will be buying more for my son .
1	i do not really like the cover of this song , but i do like the song .
1	this is a good album but it is a little boring . it is very nice to listen to but it lack the energy that a lot of her other album have . the drum are nice but i feel that the riff are not there . the guitar are nice , but not on the same level a her previous album . i think the production is good though . the song have good lyric and the musicianship is good .
0	it is an album of static noise . it is definitely not worth buying .
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song . first , there is the music : the song is fairly simply , yet build in a mid-80s era bob dylan style . nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song . the production is clean , with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal , exactly where is should be . the primary focus of the song is in the lyric . wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road , and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it .
0	this album is just great ! i can not seem to stop listening to it . the only thing i do not like about it is the name of the album doo doo doo doo doo just doe not have any meaning at all . the album is great and the song are great !
1	my wife and i listen to this album on the regular . we have a small , but not to small , collection of disney/pixar soundtrack .
0	i wa really excited to see this band live , and when i went to their concert in columbus , oh , i wa very happy . the concert wa great , but i wa really disappointed with the sound quality of the new album , so i took my chance and purchased the cd on this site . i wa not disappointed , and i think it is a great purchase .
1	the man
1	this song is so good . it is got a lot of different instrumentation , and the vocal are not a prominent like they are in other song but they are still there . it is really solid .
1	i love this song . i have a lot of favorite song from the little mermaid , but this is a favorite . i would call it a 2 star review because i do not like it a much a the two song above .
0	no , this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since . this or that record . ( usually wheel on a gravel road , which everyone seems to worship ) and i wa really so disappointed because she a ) mumble b ) slur or c ) is not a good a she wa on car wheel . true , i have always liked lucinda . in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor , not always brilliant , but always heartfelt and sincere , providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country , blue and rock .
1	this album is great .
1	this song wa one of the first song i heard on the album and i love it . it ha a great melody and ha a nice way of building up .
0	the only bad thing i can say about this album is that i do not like the song merry christmas ( i wa listening to it the other night and realized how much i love it ) . i also did not like the song you and me because it wa cheesy . the album is great but i do not like the song on it . i would give it 3 star out of 5 .
1	love this album . love the song . it is a great album . it is a good album . i think it is a good album . i really love the guitar playing and the lyric
1	this wa a very good album . i could really listen to this album all day . there are a lot of great song . the only problem is that the production is not there . the song are not real . all the song are just okay .
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book .
0	this album is too short to have any value , but the good do outweigh the bad . it get a b. i can not stand rob zombie other music , but this album is definitely worth a listen . i am a fan of rob zombie , but this album is just not rob zombie best . the song are short , but if you are a fan of rob zombie , then you will like this album . it get a b .
0	this cd is terrible . i hope this get passed on to other people . it is just an excuse to turn people off . it will drive you mad . it is just a complete waste of time . it make me sick to my stomach . it should be thrown away . it is a complete waste of time . i do not have time to listen to it , and i definitely do not want to . i would rather listen to the original how the grinch stolechristmas .
0	this is a great song , but it is too short .

0	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i heard from the movie . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud music for free .
0	this is a good album , but it is not a good a i expected it to be .
0	this is really great . i just wish that they had a few more song from this period .

0	this song is pretty slow , i think . i do not know why i did not like it . i just did not like it very much .
0	i have never been a fan of felt . i liked a lot of their work , but i always found their sound to be a little too cheesy for my taste . i have listened to this album a couple time , and i do not think it improves on the previous attempt . i would much rather listen to something that i could actually relate to , instead of a generic pop song . i think this album is just plain bad . it is mediocre , and it should stay that way .
1	- > i like the song
1	this album is one of the best album i own , and for a long a i have owned it , it ha never let me down .

0	this album is a fun album . it is made by a band from the 90 , and they played this album in the 90 . it is a fun album , but it is not very good . i do not like this album a lot . i like the beatles , but the edge is a bad singer ( i think ) , john lennon voice is terrible , and paul is so loud . the band sound like a band that would play at a place called the bongo room
1	this song rock : )
1	i love manowar . i like manowar , and god of war is a great album . i have not listened to god of war for month , and i do not know if i will ever . i am glad that i purchased this album . this album is great and not one bad song on it . i like the man of war song , and the you are no good song . there is not one bad song on this album . i bought this album on a good day .
1	i purchased this cd because i liked the sound . i could not believe that it wa a cd that came on a cd-rom . the other song are not on the cd-rom . if you are looking for a cd that is really a dvd you have not found it . the only cd-rom i have ever purchased from amazon is the job & money . if you are looking for a cd that is not actually a cd you have found it . this is a cd that is almost a cd-rom . it ha only two song on it that are not on the cd-rom . it is also , in my opinion , a very beautiful cd . the cd-rom version of this cd is very nice .
1	this cd will definetely be my fave .
1	excellent single to celebrate the 51th anniversary of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last 25 year . this single keep you moving unless you are dead and did not know it . lol excellent !

0	i love the way liza sings this song . it is so beautiful that i believe she deserves to be sung by many more people . the original song , on the other hand , need to be sung by the like of joni mitchell . it is such a shame to see it go before it is worth the time . this version is so beautiful , and i would like to hear it again .
1	i bought this group for my daughter and she love it .

1	this is a well made and enjoyable album .
0	
0	great album ! the vocal are great , but the instrument and the lyric are a little weak .
1	this is a song that should be on every christmas list for the world . how can a song that wa originally only released on vinyl be covered by this artist ? i love the original and i love the cover but this version is soooooo much better . it ha a sound that is so much more mature and soulful and is a much better version of the song .

1	this song is a good choice for the end of the summer . it can be listened to with a glass of wine in the evening .
1	what a great song . the lyric are so great . it is so well done that you just want to cry into your pillow or sit and think about what would be a great song to write . it is such a good story and the way it is told make it so real . the drum are so great and the guitar and other instrument are so good . the bass is great a well . it is such a good song and i really love it . it make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside , and i can not wait to hear the rest of the album .
0	i have just downloaded this cd .
0	this is a nice tribute to syd barrett .
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
0	i love the album , but skip this loud , over-the-top , obnoxiously sung song every time . it is definitely something bad . bad for my ear .
1	this is a wonderful band that i have heard a lot of but never really listened to until now . i have heard their cd nothin but a good time and it is excellent . i like them very much . i am looking forward to their new cd . i think it is going to be a great one .
0	i like this album . it is a good mix of the old and new song .
0	i found this to be a very interesting record . there is not a whole lot of melody , but it is very aggressive . it is pretty much a rock record , but i would say it is a bit more aggressive than that . i can see why it would be considered a very good record , but i would classify it a a good record . there is not much to say about it .
0	a fine album , but i am afraid that it is going to be a long story until we hear another tso album . i am not , but i think some of the song do not merit the price .
1	absolutely love it . one of my favorite song at the moment .
1	there is a good variety of style and mood on this album . my favorite song is the new world by james taylor . i also like shade by the beach boy . the other song are what a wonderful world from the sound of music by rodgers and hart , and all the thing you are by the beatles . the album end with a beautiful song called the impossible dream by john lennon .
0	the vocal on this song are really strong , the lyric are catchy , and the song ha a very good melody . the guitar are really good a well .
1	i enjoyed the music ; however , would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download . would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd .
1	i have listened to this cd several time . i love this album . it is a very good disc . it is great for the old and young . i have purchased it a few time and have always been pleased with it . i think it is a must have for gospel fan .
0	i liked the previous one better , but this one still doe not stand up to the original .
0	this song is so bad . i hate it .
1	oh i absolutely love this song , it is the most melodic of the 10 song on the album which is why i thought it wa a good one to give an honest review on .
0	: the only thing i do not like about this album is the music video .
0	ive been listening to them for year . i love their music . wish they had a website

1	great song .
0	i purchased this album cause i like country music . it is not bad . but it is not worth the money . i wa really disappointed with it . i think i will give it to my husband and he can listen to it with me . i am not going to listen to it anymore . i have one more album i will check out . but that is it . i am not going to listen to it anymore .
0	the album is very boring and the song on it are just good . i do not think that this album ha anything in it to make it interesting . it is so generic that it is boring to listen to . even the classical and semi-classical stuff is just generic . i would not buy this album again .
1	this wa my daughter favorite song when she wa 2. it is a great song for 1st grader . the song is really easy to sing along with . i would recommend this song to anyone who love the beatles .
0	i thought that this wa a good find and replace program . i found a reference to find and replace on the web , but it wa written in 2002. well , at least it can give you a list of all the word that you can find in a word file . it can not find an exclamation point , but it can give you the word that contains the exclamation point . it can not find a minus sign , but it can give you the word that contains the minus sign . it can not find a plus sign , but it can give you the word that contains the plus sign . it can not find an underscore , but it can give you the word that contains the underscore . it can not find a hyphen , but it can give you the word that contains the hyphen . it can not find an apostrophe , but it can give you the word that contains the apostrophe . it can give you the word that contains the apostrophe , the word that contains the hyphen , the word that contains the underscore , the word that contains the plus sign , the word that contains the minus sign , and the word that contains the exclamation point . it can not find any other punctuation mark , but it can give you the word that contains the other punctuation mark . it can not find a number sign , but it can give you the word that contains the number sign . it can not find a period , but it can give you the word that contains the period . it can not find a comma , but it can give you the word that contains the comma . it can not find a semicolon , but it can give you the word that contains the semicolon .
0	this song is fantastic , i love the guitar solo .
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
1	i remember hearing this song at a party and it wa a very good song . i like the first verse better than the last . it is a very good pop song . the lyric are very deep and they have a good message about forgiveness . the arrangement is very good and there is a good beat to it . it is definitely a good song and i can not wait for the band to record more great pop song .
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance . i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it .
1	this song ha some good guitar work , bass , and drum , but i do not like the song . i do not know why , but i like this song .
1	i like mouse even though i hate this song .
0	it is a classic rock album . the melody are very well done . the riff are tight and melodic . the lyric are very well written . the music is very clean and ha a certain groove to it . the production is very good with the song being a little too quiet for my taste .
1	the song is a great song .
0	this is a good band , in my opinion . they are very good live and very nice to listen to .
0	i really enjoyed this tribute to frank sinatra . i wa disappointed to hear the part of a new kind of love wa not sung . the arrangement wa great and i thought the singer wa excellent . i had a great time listening to this tribute . i would have liked to have heard a bit of the part of a new kind of love sung . i thought it wa a good tribute to frank sinatra . i just think that some of the word were a little over the top . i wish to hear the rest of the tribute .
1	i wa so surprised to find this song on the store . i have been looking for it for a long time . this is a good song , the lyric are great , and there is some great music on the album . this is a very , very good album .
1	very nice collection of song . the quality of the file is great .
0	this album is a must for any fan of the great , the good , and the bad of bob dylan .
1	i have heard many time this song on the radio , and thought it wa a good song . i never heard this song on the radio until i wa looking for song on the internet . i like this song and the album .
0	this is a great book . you can find it at any bookstore , or at home if you do not want to drive to a bookstore . the story of the book is just a heartwarming a the book itself . and the book is fun to read .
0	after download it wa fuzzy and distorted
0	this track is very good , but it doe sound like it wa made by someone who doe not really know what they are doing .
1	i have seen them 5 time over the last three year and they always put on a great show . this is my favorite of the bunch . i think this is the best version of the song . it is very melodic and i think the band ( which is great ) is the key to why it is so great . i have seen them all over the world . they bring a lot of energy to the stage .
0	this is a decent compilation of song that is worth listening to . the song are all r & b , but some of the song are a little too slow for my taste . i do not mind slow song , but i do not like too much of the same material over and over . if you are looking for something that will take you back to a period , this is a good starting point .
0	this song wa played on the dvd a well a the bluray . the cd version is an excellent product . great sound . i played it about 5 time . i do not like the vocal . i downloaded the song to my amazon cloud and it work great . i highly recommend buying this cd version .
0	i can not believe i am saying this but i am not going to buy this album . i have already bought my cd from the band . this album is no better than the cd . i am sorry to say but you are a crappy band . i will not buy your cd .
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
0	i have been listening to this album for the last year and decided to buy it . i had not heard of the artist , but the quality of the song and the vocal were quite unique . i bought this for my husband , and he had no trouble recognizing the song and playing the instrumentals . i am currently listening to it again . i wa surprised when i wa told that the recording wa from a home studio . it is amazing how the quality of the recording could have been better .
1	this is the first time i have seen this cd . i thought it wa a good cd . it is great for little kid to listen to while playing around with the toy . i would recommend it to anyone to listen to while they play .
0	oh please . whomever keep saying pearl jam is better than nirvana need to let up . pearl jam is worse than nirvana , yet i despise both . they both sold out . vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet , and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major . yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him . he had always been lazy , and nevermind reflects that . it is pure pop-rock on par with bon jovi , and he refused to admit it .
0	it may be one of the best cd from the last few year but i do not think i have ever been more disappointed in a cd that i have ever bought . the album doe not live up to the expectation i had in mind . the song are good but the production is very poor . it seems the music is better but the production is very poor . i will never buy another cd by them !
1	i love this song and johnny hartman is one of the most talented and gifted singer in the world .
1	i just downloaded it and i like it .
1	gretchens christmas collection is one of the best holiday cd i have ever heard and a collection that i will treasure forever . it is filled with song from a variety of genre from the 70 to today , and the song are fantastic . i have no idea how she can put this all together because the song are so diverse . i love the fact that she can put old classic and new song together to make a great christmas album . i am sure you will love it too . i am sure you will make a new friend or two . i am sure you will enjoy every minute of it . i am sure you will love it so much that you will buy your own christmas cd . i am sure you will love it so much that you will not want to listen to any other music until you have this one .
1	this is a great song that will make you smile . it is a very positive song .
1	: i love this song ; it is a great song .
1	this song i would like to hear more . it is a great song .
1	
1	this is a great album . i love the song california love it is one of jewel best song . the second track all you need is love also is very good .
0	i wa raised a christian , but i never truly believed . my parent were always very religious , but they never told me what they believed . i grew up going to a church that wa very strict and very strict . i grew up feeling very small . but , i am a christian now . i love the music , song , music , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , picture , and most of all , i love god .
0	i bought it and it really is a good song . i hope it can go on and on .
1	i just bought this and it is exactly what i have been waiting for . thank you so much for your service , i will be sure to buy again when i am done with my order .
0	this album just doe not have much going for it . i am not really into the beatles and this album is no exception . i am just not a big fan of their music . i am a bit disappointed with the quality of the song . there are very few song that stand out from others . the melody were good , but they were not very memorable . the lyric were ok , but not very good . i think the beatles had a lot of material and this album is just not very enjoyable . i guess the beatles were just too famous to make a good album . i am sure it will sell a lot of album , but i will probably be waiting a long time for it . i am not sure why they did this . the disc that had the best song wa disc 2 , because it wa the most recent . the other disc are just average . i guess they just came out with a new disc for the holiday . i am not sure what it is about this album that make me so disappointed .
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
1	this is a great album for fan of the band that will enjoy it . a very good album for fan of the band that will enjoy it . a very good recording for fan of the band that will enjoy it . a very good album in general .
0	i have only listened to this album twice . when i first heard this i liked it . then i got into it a little bit and i started to really like it . then i tried listening to it again . i find it to be repetitive and boring . it is just the same song over and over . i do not see what is so special about it . also , this is an old album by him which he ha been doing for a long time . i do not like it when artist do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and .
1	this cd is so good , it is great . i love it .
1	the cd is awesome ! i always love the music from this cd . the sound quality is great and the artwork is very well done .
0	i had the impression that this song wa a remake of an old song that had been made to be a hit at the time but never wa .
0	one of brandis best . the eye is the best song on this cd . it is a very powerful song , well-sung , and with a great message . the wherever is your heart is a classic . it is not very good , but it is just a good a any of the better song on this disc . i would give this disc a rating of 5 star if the song were just a good in quality a the song on the radio . i would like to have the whole disc , but i would not pay $ 15.00 to get it . i think it is worth $ 15.99 , but i would not pay $ 30.00 for it .
0	i will never buy another bob dylan album .
0	really bad . i do not know why they named this a dubstep song . it is just a normal dubstep song with a cheesy feel to it .
0	not a bad song . very good vocal and very good harmony .
1	this collection of music is an absolute masterpiece .
1	awesome record . i am not a big fan of the band , but i love the album . one of the best i have ever heard .
1	i bought strypers first album over a year ago and a i listen to it i am amazed at how different it is compared to the other album . it ha more variety and a little more power and depth to the music . i would absolutely buy this album again .
1	the song start with a little rap , and then it is done . it is not about the politics , it is just about the music .
0	i just do not understand people who like this album . the album is just a bore to me . i like more upbeat stuff , i like good country song . i do not like this album .
1	this is awesome ! i pop this cd in around thanksgiving and it basically play until january ! josh did an outstanding job . i love his version of the classic christmas song , especially little drummer boy . every track is great , in my opinion , however i am not to keen on the first noel . mainly because i am not a fan of faith hill voice and i am not convinced that their voice harmonize well together . again , that is just my opinion . i would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone .
1	the first song that i had a chance to listen to all wa i have got your number , and i really liked it . the rest of this album is pretty decent . i like the sound of the sample on this album , and i really like the lyric on this album a well .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
1	this song brought tear to my eye . this is wonderful .
0	i have heard of in this life and it seemed like something that everyone should experience at least once . i wa very happy to find it here . i have to say , i actually liked the song . it wa much smoother with the addition of the music , and the lyric were a lot of fun to sing along with . i think i would have enjoyed it more if there wa more substance to it , but i suppose that is not always the case .
1	this is the best song from this album
1	this is a really good rock album . it is very interesting music with a very unique sound and a very unique style . it ha a great melody on the guitar and the way they play it is very musical . it ha great vocal and the way the vocal are mixed together make a great blend of sound . the song have a great deal of energy which is why they are able to play them so loudly . the instrumentals are very good , the bass is great , the drum are great and everything is well balanced . all the song are very powerful and really fun to listen to . i really like the way their music is done . they are very creative and have a unique sound on their music .
1	bonnie raitt is a great singer . she ha a great voice and her song are easy to listen to . i like her style of singing and i feel that this style of singing is what will be her signature . i feel that she need to continue to write song that are more about the lyric than the music .
1	i like the arrangement and the song is very nice . i have only listened to this song twice and that wa at my parent house when my mom wa over . i like the music and the arrangement . i like the song and i do not know why i am buying it again . i have been listening to christmas music for a long time and i have purchased this song twice . i do not like the song , i do not like the song and i do not like the song . the song doe not make me feel sleepy . i do not like the song now . i will not purchase this song again .

0	i do not listen to a lot of jewel , but this album is very nice . the song are all really well-written and produced . there is a song that is just a great composition , and another song that just ha a nice tempo and beat . the lyric are not all that great though , and the singer , taz , ha great voice , but it is not that great of a song .
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
0	0304 see jewel cross-over from her folk-country root to pop . laced with heavy beat and keyboard , this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense . whereas , jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling , this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her . her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener . i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me .
1	all i can say is wow . i have listened to this cd for a long time . i would have to say that this is the best cd that i have ever had the chance to listen to . it wa an amazing experience listening to this cd . it is a real pleasure to listen to it . it is a good way to get kid to listen to music again .
1	this album is a great album . my favorite song is the intro or the song . this album is like a very good action movie . the guitar solo are excellent on this album . the vocal are nice , but i prefer the first album . i would recommend this album to anyone who like rock and roll and great song .
1	this song brings me back to a time when my father passed away . it brings me back to a time when i did not know my dad . it a beautiful song .
0	ordered the wrong one but i listened it it too late to return for an exchange
0	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can . but , i have not heard it in year . i just can not get it . what do you think ?
0	this the second best song on the album . this song is really good and really catchy .
1	this cd is very positive and great for new song . i will definitely .
1	this is an excellent arrangement of the song lily of the valley from the album greatest hit . it is a nice song .
1	the only true lullaby song that i could ever figure out . i will keep listening to it until i figure it out
1	this album ha a beautiful theme and great lyric .
1	this song still hold up nearly 30 year late . dramatic , big hook , great sounding production .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i wa eagerly looking forward to this cd after watching hollie on britain got talent on youtube . when i first played it i thought something had gone wrong with my sound system . after trying it a few more time i realized it wa actually the production . hollie ha an incredibly beautiful voice , but that wasnt allowed to come through . the second song , edelweiss sounded more like a piano concert with someone singing along in the background . the piano virtually drowned out her voice . this wa also the case in other song but edelweiss is the worst example . whoever mixed the recording did a great disservice to hollie and her fan . i hope she come out with another cd in the future recorded with different people or a different company .
0	this say it is the clean version but it is not .
1	great product
1	this is actually a great song . i am truly a died hard fan for k. michelle so i do not mind keeping it real . it is about time she is singing something that is a make up record . she ha always recorded break-up record and album , and now it is great and surprising to hear her sing something new . she is crazy , sometimes rude and take thing to the extreme , but one thing that is true is that she can sing ! support real music and trust she will deliver . you do not have to like her , but you have to like her music . and i love it ! she doe not have two number one album for no reason .
0	katy perry second hit song , is very . catchy but it is annoying . it is one of those song you can not help but hum certain part to and the video is just . well , it is just there . i thought the lady dancing with the umbrella or whatever wa kinda cool the first time i saw it but i wa wrong . this song is just the flavor of the week and when i first heard it i did not like it . it is gotten a bit better since then but do not expect this to win any grammies , lol 2.5 star .
0	you would think that this is the exact same track from the paperman short , but you would be wrong . it is missing the electric guitar that come in at 5:15 during the actual video . meaning it is meant to be present around the 3:40 mark for the mp3 . for me , this omission ruin the entire track . disappointed .
0	i have listened to this new album a dozen or more time now . i have gone back and listened to his very first album to his most current . i even pulled out the dvd album and gave them a listen a well . closer without question is his very best album - the most solid performance from track to track . illumination is without question the worst . there is no other artist who i listen to more over time than mr. groban . his song have soothed away many stressful moment and day . his voice is unlike any other . he is talented and a gifted singer and song writer . yet this doe not change the fact that this new album is hand down the worst . in some way , i wish it wa never been released . for it tarnish his previous accomplishment . i do not blame mr. groban for this , even though he chose his producer , but i do blame his advisor and most of all , the producer . rick rubin is no david foster . even though i am not a personal fan of david foster - his arrogance is not very becoming . his ability to but together solid album and attach song to the right performer for the right hit is without question impeccable . and with this said , maybe he deserves to be arrogant . mr. groban doe have the ability to write some very moving song . the best one have been in collaboration with other more experienced writer . redirection is needed for the next album . heck , if it wa me , i would go back to the studio instead of go out on tour and put together an album that would be nothing le than his very best . many of the standard which mr. groban ha sung off album in various performance venue could lay the ground work for such an album . yet there ha to be new material to bring the album to a level that alters the musical stage . this is where the experienced writer in the rock , pop and classical venue could bring work together to pull off an album unlike any other . in the end , this is just my opinion , among many starry eye grobanites who are already gathering for the upcoming tour . let u hope he performs only two or three song from this album while on tour and the rest pulled from all his previous accomplishment and those outstanding performance you have added along the way at many of your venue . i wanted this album to be better than any of the previous album . my hope were high thus why i am so disappointment by this collection of song . without question his voice remains perfect for the right material for the next album . this doe shine through despite the haphazard collection of song that make up illumination . i now look forward to his next album knowing full well mr. groban ha decade of music yet to bring to all of u to enjoy .
0	if you want conscious breathing exercise , i would rate this a 5. great for someone with asthma or other breathing issue . each step is breathing between different point of the body from eye brow to finger to toe . the problem i had with sleeping wa long pause between vocal instruction distracting pulling the focus to another place . i bought the cd to get further into conscious deep sleep . i had the reverse effect . however , a an aid in the morning getting oxygen moving through the body , the meditation doe work . i feel refreshed yet energized .
0	a rehash of very old willie . 50 poorly recorded cut of the early year . total disappointment . look for better collection .
1	great mid-tempo song . make me smile . great for workout , long drive , etc . brings you up . would like more of the same .
0	sound wa terrible . could not here actor speak because music is too loud
0	i downloaded this and it start over in the middle of the download a bad one this one and it still cost me so watch when getting this song !
0	thought i wa downloading the original version . very disappointed .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .
0	the cd stalled halfway through the first song . not satisfied !
1	only ha a 7 song but i love them all he sound just like he did when i fell in love with him on sunday best . it is nice to hear a nice young fresh and new voice singing the word of god they could not have picked a better title for the album it wa well done and i have been waiting for it most of the song he performed on sunday best are on here tracklist 1.god in me- joshua put his youth flava and some gospel hiphop singing the mary mary hit 2.we expect you- one of the song that helped him one sunday best 3.rain on us- josh go off on this song you can feel every word he sings with so much power on this one 4.i am still standing- that signature joshua rogers sound with the scat and run : ) 5. in the middle- he say before the song start that he is about to jam and he doe just that 6.peace be still- seems like youngbuck channeled kim burrell on this record i thought it wa her at first lol 7.well done- the album finish with well done * clap hand * congrats young buck for winning sunday best and putting out ya first album can not wait to hear more and some original song
1	all about our god !
0	amazon service and speed of delivery wa excellent , but the cd no longer will play , only played it twice , now no longer work ! i guess you get what you pay for applies here !
1	so very good . he is my favorite singer . wish i did not have to wait for the entire album to come out in april
1	great album !
0	my mother and i absolutely love josh groban and this song . but we were very disappointed when it only played the first verse and the chorus like five more time . very disappointing rendition
1	man i wore this cd out when i wa a kid . and the music is timeless . best compelation i ever had and i got it with a burrito . you do not get any better than that .
1	just another one of those snappy tune that make me want to move . i love this tune and hope you will try it out .
1	being a band nerd , i like listening to band music . this compilation is first rate , and i hope that student will ask their director to program on or more of these selection for an upcoming concert or festival . i hope director will take the time to listen and say to themselves yeah , my band can play this ! i first heard of stephen melillos music a a college student . i wa selected to play in the kkpsi/tbs national intercollegiate band in 1993 , and we performed his a walk in jurassic park . what awesome music ! i thought to myself , and it wa fun to play , too . i have performed some his music with my own band , and the player really enjoy the craft which mr. melillo put into his composition .
1	artist all the time do remake of some of the classic . sometimes they take on song that shoe are too big to fill so to speak . but in this instance chris brown did it justice and then some .
0	i am a huge fan going way back , so i will not say directly that it suck ( but it definitely lack gravitational pull ) . bob tar-lunged croak is now absolutely intollerable here on these christmas standard ! the zydeco arrangement on must be santa is kinda fun , but his shredded voice just make me imagine that i am listening to someone with a blocked tracheostomy tube . i feel this cd could be a powerful learning tool for middle school health class . student would listen and compare nashville skyline with this dreck and thus learn an impacting life lesson on the danger of cigarette .
0	the song that i wanted is cut off and doe not end correctly . it stop in the middle of a phrase . i could not use it .
1	best song of that year . waiting for the next one
1	i wa so happy to find this song for kindle fire . it downloaded easily into my itunes . absolutely love it .
0	i am a big van halen fan . but . this live album is a lttle too late . dave , dave , dave . wassup ? he had it together for the initial reunion tour , but seems to have fallen back into that lounge lizard act that eventually sunk his solo career . he no longer seems interested in singing the lyric , but rather talking , and mumbling his way through them . although not 100 % . he still ha the chop if he chooses to use them . his very recent foo fighter appearance singing panama , show he can do better . but let spread some of the blame around . it is been a long time since i heard any live album recorded/mixed this badly . i swear it sound like an audience shot cellphone vid with the sound ripped off it . it is just atrocious ! everything is just muddled together , and blurry sounding . i am aware live is live , but what ? no mixing board at that venue ? no effort to clean it up or separate track in the studio ? i am really surprised the band put their stamp of approval on this recording . a bad a the finally result , i think it may have been way better with decent recording/mixing . after rumor of a new recording baring no fruit , i think this wa just slapped together with little effort , just to get something out there . sloppy effort by all involved . i am still looking for good quality sound/video recording of the initial reunion tour . this one aint gon na cut it . sorry .
0	have no clue what this is
0	i bought album for some old favorite i remember . the playlist list the correct song title but the song that play is different . most song are probably correct but four of my traditional favorite ( when irish eye are smiling , who put the overalls. , macnamaras band , etc ) were not really what played . very strange but a waste of money .
1	great song ! i cry every time i hear it .
0	great music obviously , but awful remastering - even worse than the 3cd chrome box . sound thin and tinny , like it is coming out of a transistor radio . the mighty chrome deserve better , but they will never get it a long a they are on cleopatra .
0	meh
0	the beat is choppy over typical 80 rythym . you get the feeling of a james bond film . i think i did hear it @ the beginning of a james bond film . i always thought duran duran wa from england .
0	hall & oates a interpreted by a 1977 casio wristwatch and a screech owl . this is the best of the first quarter of 2010 ? no star ! ( well , i guess i have to give this crap one star to get outa here . ) why only 1 blue album ?
1	love this song !
0	disc 2 wa not stopping at all it played for 6 hour over and over
1	what a great song . the fact that my daughter love it a much a i do is a bonus . the fact that it brought such a wonderful compliment to such a really well done and modern curious george is pure greatness !
0	not happy with this one , do not know if it wa my fault or not but after the download the song disappeared into the bowel of my computer and i still can not find it .
1	great song i am not that much into country but might be changing , ( not all the way , but will checking out ) love the song
1	i like messianic music , so this wa a treat for me . many paul wilbur work , but others a well .
0	when i first played this cd , i thought to myself that the singer did not sound like johnny rodriguez . then i looked at the cover of the cd and noted the following : all selection are new stereo recording performed by the original artist or one or more member of the original group . not sure what this is supposed to mean , but to me the singing doe not sound like the johnny rodriquez that i am used to . do not waste your money on this unless you like johnny rodriquez song that sound like they are being sung by someone else .
0	thumb down
1	good song .
0	why would anyone want to listen to this absolute trash ha everyone been brainwashed by this hideous creature i cant seem to understand ?
0	what ha natalie done to the tigerlily song ? gone are the upbeat mix from 1990s . in it place stand a moody post 9/11 collection fit for a stuffy vega lounge at 2am . what happened to natalie singing about the springtime of life like in these are day or romantic observation like verdi cry ? between this and her self titled album from 2014 it seems everything she ha released recently ha gone down a more somber path . do not leave your 90 fan wondering what happened .
0	you can buy a cd same price with 73 track on it .so if you have not got that .then do not buy this nokia site a the album on download
1	big third day fan and this did not disappoint !
1	awsome song !
0	love waylon , but this wa a little bit of a dissappointment .
0	i purchased this song but it never download onto my computer . i have no idea what happened but this a well a many others wa never downloaded and i didnt want to do it again and pay more money for somehing i already paid for .
0	the tune were mccartney , the stack on each disc seemed awkward . excluding disc 1 , there were song included that were to be honest pure junk . tune i had never heard and they were poor representative of the career . i guess it is a bit like any other mccartney disc , you are lucky if you 5 out of ten that make sense .
1	one of my son really wanted this song and think it is 5 star for sure !
0	maybe it is just my age showing but i like jazz and i like most pre 2000 rock but this wa terrible . i collect a lot of music even some i do not care for but this one i deleted right after i listened to it .
0	the vast majority of this cd are live recording which rarely do the artist justice . scott mckenzies san francisco ( be sure to wear some flower in your hair ) is one of the better quality song , marty balin and the town crier hellbound train is well done and dan hick and the hot lick how can i miss you if you never go away is quite humorous . overall this promise more than it delivers .
1	satisfied
1	catchy tune written by an old pro with many good song under his belt . i think it reflects on a career in a very messed up industry .
0	did not like this album . totally hated la llave de mi corazon it sounded like the song you would hear on a burger king commercial . why add the english lyric ? there is no need for it . i am totally disappointed and deleting from my ipod . get all of his previous material , because it is really world class .
1	love their music
1	another classic !
1	album of the year ! i love every song ! my only complaint is that the album is too short , so quality over quantity is definitely the case here !
1	great shipping time ! product a described .
1	the greatest band no one ha ever heard of ha done it again . how doe a band get better and better after every album is beyond me . happy to call them my favorite band with one of the greatest song writer ever .
0	this wa the clean version , i want all my music they way the artist intended , with f-bombs !
1	one of the top 10 christmas single ever .
0	it ok
1	andy williams singing ha always been of the highest quality and his backup arrangement some of the finest . this is a great song for lover .
0	i remember liking this song when it wa popular 5 yr ago . really stunned at what i heard when i listened to this song and her other work available online from that era ( and since ) . am i the only one that think she absolutely can not stay in tune ? she flat out every few bar , she sings at a register that is not flattering to her voice and frankly the quality of her voice is at best very average . overall kind of meh .
0	very poor recording quality .
1	zipper catch skin wa far better than many of the reviewer here seem to think . if you are stuck in the early 70s-or bust mentality of cooper-fandom , then this album is not for you . but zcs is strong from beggining to end , with catchy tune and interesting lyric which at time border on the hilarious . adaptable , i like girl , remarkably insincere , all rock and stay in your head long after you listen to them , mainly because of the lyric . this wa the third of a strong trilogy of alices 80 album , the others being flush the fashion and special force . all three , while they do not match most of his 70 album , deliver the hard rock good , while drifting away from alices horror persona in favour of alice the stand-up comic . it work . the one weak moment for me is the painful theme from the class of 1984 , i am the future , which should have tipped u off to what wa to come- namely the dreadful dada album .
0	the album is great so do not think the star are for that . it get lower star rating because it is censored . the sad thing is that the amazon store kinda doe not tell you this . when you buy a album uncut it will be labeled [ explicit ] but one that is clean ha nothing like [ censored ] or [ clean ] next to it . jim gaffigan now is basically a clean comedian and thus i did not think anything of there not being a label for being explicit but this album wa done before he became a clean comic and a such a some swearing in it and the censoring is enough to ruin it . i think amazon need to label something a edited or censored so people do not get screwed over . i know i am not the only one who had this problem and this is not the only album for which this is a issue . again great album but buy the cd so you get it uncut and skip the download .
1	i love this song . it fit the movie .
1	the best !
0	so sad , so big boring and overproduced compared to the first two . who said coldplay 2.0 ? no , wait , i sometimes like coldplay .
0	this is not the version that wa sampled by mobb deep . i have yet to find that version for sale . this is not a good substitute in my opinion .
0	this cd ha a good sound but you get tired of her moaning and complaining ! very depressing ! her voice crack , scrape and she can not quite hit the note . buy bonnie raitt instead .
1	i love everything adele sings .
0	thie album is pretty good , redneck crazy is by far the best song . i would not buy music from amazon again . have to use their player to down load and it is crap . have to pa 25 a year to add your track to it if you have over 250
0	adam voice is so deeply buried under the effect that it is unrecognizable . his second album wa the best - he wa starting to define his style and find worthy song . the material is weak and the lyric are laughable . this is a slickly produced attempt to make him a mainstream pop star . he wa never that - his forte wa his wide range vocal style and his ability to convey emotion and the meaning of the word . his interpretation of classic on american idol ( mad world , track of my tear ) , made the song his own . he toured with queen and wa a good or better live than freddie mercury ( vocally , even though he could not match his stage presence or personality ) . i guess his first two cd did not sell enough to satisfy his label and their stockholder - so this is a last ditch effort to attempt to turn him into a middle aged justin bieber . we do not need another shallow electronica/pop/disco clone ! good luck adam - i think you have lost the majority of your fan base . you can rock and you can wrench the emotion out of a good ballad .
0	typical , i love pitbull , but you have fallen into a same old same old rutget some new blood in the machine baby !
0	lousy quality recording , you really have to be a die hard zappa fan to like it . i would also say it is best to listen to after 6 or 7 beer .
0	i think this song is worse than perfect stranger . i am pretty disappointed in this band . i think i am gon na stick to listening to music that i already know or band that are more popular .
0	no banjo . i wa simply disappointed by the overall sound . i loved mumfords first album , and thought the second one wa just a good if not better . i wa very excited to receive this cd the first day it came out , but after listening to it three time end to end , i felt bored . after the first week , i accidentally left it in the cd player of my rental car when i returned it , and made no effort to retrieve it . i hold out hope that the group make a 4th album and move back toward the sound that made the original two cd so terrific .
1	loved every song
1	love this version of tu amor mi amor by formula five . use to listen when growing . my mom love the song , good time .
0	i wa a huge fan of dm album like music for the mass , black celebration , and violator . i also enjoyed people are people , some song on broken frame and much of speak and spell . but , most of this record never did anything for me . it is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80 that i did not really try to like from band i liked . but , a few song like lie to me are good a i recall , but people are people is a stronger early mode post speak and spell choice . stick with music for the mass , violator , black celebration , people are people , and speak and spell .
0	i am not a fan of the new stuff . : (
1	an absolute classic in my eye !
1	great song !
0	this song is a blatanly obvious janet jackson rhythmn nation era ripoff song . dated late eighty early ninety production ha not dated too well . this is from an era when the cassette single were the rage and civilles and cole were at da top of their game and peep wuz cuttin their hair in a high top fade like will smith and arsenio .
1	nice product . would recommend this seller .
0	according to frontman/songwriter ra mcguire , the problem started when the band wa denied what they felt wa well-deserved production credit on the preceding thick a thief lp . this wa after the label had voiced it approval , including consulting with them a to the layout of promised credit . tot wa the last album randy bto bachman ever produced for trooper . lawsuit were filed , friendship were scuttled , and , most significantly , they went with a different producer ( howard steele of heart fame ) . what that mean to the listener is that the man who for 4-5 year had arranged for them and groomed the overall sonic output ( and who also happened to be one of the best guitarist/songwriters in the business ) wa now out the door , to be replaced by perhaps someone with le ability to say no to some of ra le inspired notion . so what doe the first non-rb produced trooper album sound like ? well , aside from the reasonably solid opener ( which happens to be the first trooper track i would ever heard back when it wa a hit , and one of my favorite by the band ) , we get a weakly performed kink cover ( compare to van halens you really got me released roughly about the same time ) , some cheesy ballad , mixed with some filler , not to mention a couple of song about what a douche randy supposedly is . production credit indeed . that this album wa one of their best-sellers speaks more to their popularity at the time than the actual quality of the product . after this one came out , they basically had kicked themselves out of the big time , a subsequent sale will attest . to add insult to injury , they still ended up paying out randy half of his remaining contract ( 3 full album ) . sheesh . talk about a pyrrhic victory . although by 1990s ten , they had started to kick some as again , this album represents a period of decline in relevance a they rediscovered their voice without their mentor ( who doe not necessarily take any more credit for their 70 success than ra songwriting . but , sometimes it is what a producer _will not_ let the artist do that is just a important , ya know ?
1	i am just starting to get interested in classical music . this a great bargain . i do not like all of the song but there is a wide variety ; some very familiar . if you want a great overall selection at a great price , this is a must have .
0	i love fleetwood and stevie , but just could not get into this album .
1	i love everything she ha ever done . i periodically need to purchase a new cd to replace a scratched one .
1	i am sure this is a common song for a funeral service which is what i bought it for , but alan jackson just doe an exceptional job with it .
1	i do not pretend to be familiar with the detail of tanes career aside from what i can infer from listening to her music - and i have not yet heard all of her 1990s-era release ( because they are a little difficult to find . ) but given the fact that the vast majority of her work subsequent to the 1990s fall into the pop and light jazz genre , i get the impression that for hetero her manager ( or producer , whatever , ) wa trying to nudge her into alt-rock , that tane herself wa more interested in . pop and light jazz , but acquiesced to a harder-edged album all the same . an artist is going to follow her own path , obviously , but i wish tane-san wouldve done an album or two more of straight-ahead rock , because she is good at it and her voice is well suited for it . the hetero album is something that fan of rock and female vocalist should snap up at their first opportunity , because although it ha some minor downside , it is akin to a buried pop-rock treasure . since there is no track listing here i will do a blow-by-blow : 1. kaeshite ( give it back ) start with a strange , almost playful verse , take some wonderfully unexpected twist in chord progression , pick up a stark , thin drumbeat , then dive into an excellent , somewhat angsty chorus which , again , traverse a chord progression unlike anything i have heard before . just a great , understated rock tune . 2. down is far more poppy , but with the same arresting vocal attitude . the groove here is just acoustic guitar and vocal over simple percussion and later some subtle keyboard , but here is where tanes unique voice shine through . it is difficult for me to explain exactly why , but her voice reminds me of phoebe snow . maybe it because of that strange vibrato , which sound both tightly-controlled and loose at the same time , but that comparison keep jumping out at me , even year after i first heard this disc . 3. cut the fruit is a little funky , a little jazzy , with beautiful , floating , upbeat transitional groove between verse and chorus . there is a satisfying gnarly-twangy guitar break in the bridge , then back to that glide-groove , then a rideout chorus that brings the tune to an abrupt end . just an excellent groove from start to finish . 4. ame to gamu ( chewing gum candy ) is hard to describe . again it is vocal over acoustic guitar ( something that ordinarily bore the hell out of me , ) but the vocal melody in this song is nothing short of spellbinding . there is a lot of really weird instrumentation ( synth wash , and . french accordion ? ) but it all mesh perfectly . the bridge is a bass solo , something that seems to send american producer running like frightened rabbit . if you have spent much time listening to japanese rock and pop , one of the first happy discovery you will experience is that the bass guitar is rarely relegated to that anonymous dum-dum-dum-dum-dum drone buried deep in the background , but rather is an integral , catalyzing element of the mix . how or why japan ha some of the most phenomenal bassist on earth ( masaki of daida laida and liv moon , koga michiko of doll $ boxx and gacharic spin , king-san [ formerly ] of shakalabbits , onda yoshihito of zamza and judy and mary , hibiki of light bringer , etc. , ) is beyond me . ditto how or why japan ha an abundance of recording engineer and producer who treat the bass a an instrument on an even par with guitar and vocal . but i am really , really glad that is the case . anyhow , ame to gamu is an unforgettable song , and tanes vocal performance is just phenomenal here . and i almost forgot : something that put a big , goofy smile on my face every time i listen to this song is the fact that the last three chord of the song are a quote of that three-chord figure in jimis wind cry mary . whether that is incidental or intentional , it . just make me smile . 5. memoria is maybe the best song on this album , but undercut by an annoyance in the recording : the heavier part are noticeably distorted . you have to push that annoyance aside , because memoria is just epic - one of those song that is like a heartfelt little journey or adventure . it begin soft a a feather , build and build , explodes in anthemic chorus , then after a brief acoustic bridge turn a corner into an unexpected , melodically-magical passage that build to it own crescendo - with tane pouring heart and soul into the vocal - to end on that same soft-as-a-feather place it started . this is one of those tune you can listen to for the first time today , yet will seem like it wa the backdrop for some of the most moving experience of your life , a song that is been with you for year . that , folk , is powerful songwriting . just a great song - easily one of my all-time faves . it is unfortunate that the engineer distorted the hell out of the guitar on the chorus , but . great song . 6. no joker start with tanes sly vocal over piano and drum that sound a little like solo john lennon - but this is the tune i like least on the album , mostly because of the chorus , which have tane stretching her range too much , amid repeat of the line i wan na be your woman / i wan na be your woman . it is not a horrid song , but to me the chorus are awkward and a little annoying , and the bridge is just weird , and not in a good way . 7. kakekko ( sprint or race ) is a mellow groove with a pretty vocal melody and touch of reverb-ambience , evocative of sitting in a garden pagoda in a cool cloudburst . there is also an understated acoustic slide solo in the bridge . 8. kage no naka no kage ( shadow in the middle of a shadow ) is the most jazzy tune on the disc - more in line with the stuff she is done since - but an excellent , relaxed groove . 9. daite te hoshii ( i want you to hold me ) is another jazzy tune , mellower than kage , with just vocal over electric piano and some periodic synth pulse , then the same over a drumbeat , with some funk-flavored instrumentation with the chorus . the vocal melody is not a interesting a the rest of the song , which lead me to believe it is one of those song that rest more heavily on lyrical content than musicality ( just a guess , since my nihongo skill are only a little bit beyond the three most important phrase in any language , namely , where is the beer ? where is the restroom ? and i love you , generally in that order - and i have not sat down to translate it . ) 10. tree close out the album in a dreamy , atmospheric wash , with tanes voice processed through a thin radio mic patch that fit the song perfectly . there are two break into slower-tempo groove that are actually more powerful and dramatic than the faster tempo of the rest of the song . an understated but relentlessly cool tune . i am far more a rock guy than either jazz or pop , so although there are a lot of her tune i like from later album , hetero is her standout disc - for that rock element . but again , i still have not gotten around to getting her other 90 disc . if you like alt-rock that is generally upbeat rather than a massive boat-anchor of metaphysical angst , and if you enjoy totally unique voice , get hetero . definitely time well spent .
1	love it . and just got exactly what i wanted and no more . save bzillians this way ! greatest invention ever in the music industy . thanks !
1	great blueys song
1	guy ! i wa so excited when i heard thalia wa going to have a new cd , and that excitement wa really worth it when i bought and listened to this cd ! all the song are just amazing ! thalia ha grown a an artist from album to album . all i can say is that i recommend this cd to everyone , it fantastic !
0	i could not download this . i tried multiple time and reading all of the help info did not help ! very disappointed
0	not clean ! still ha the word damn .
0	every time i try to play . it crash my computer . dont buy . i bought to add to a powerpoint presentation and it will not work .
0	prime music is worthless . i am not renewing next year since i can not download prime song for free to my computer . i paid for this , tutorial say you can download song to your pc , but your s * app will not let me . and on top of this , i hate this song .
1	i have been looking for some inspiration today , and i found it online at amazon .
0	wack
0	the song is great , but the quality of the download from amazon is absolutely horrendous . i will never purchase music from amazon again . very disappointed .
1	this instrumental version of over the rainbow is absolutely perfect . it seems silly at first but give it a listen and you might see why i am saying it is good . a 101 string orchestra really fill out this song and help it deliver the impact it wa intended to especially during the chorus . preview it and judge for yourself .
0	embedded drm prevents burning amazon.com downloaded mp3 to a cd . digital player only . i do not recommend these downloads for this reason .
0	this is not the theme from enterprise . this is the same song , where my heart will take me , that wa used a the theme for enterprise but this version from the encore cd is not the same arrangement and the difference are somewhat disappointing if you are expecting the actual theme from the enterprise tv series .
0	not so great .
0	seth ! man , who broke your heart. ? your voice is amazingly smooth and velvety , and the orchestral arrangement are some of the most wonderful instrumentals to listen to in a long time . but still , neither is enough to let me sit through 17 song of depression , loneliness , pining , cry . in your liner note you wrote of you trying to not make this album too one note . but your failed . unless you are wanting someone to put a gun to their head or go jump in the river , i can not recommend this , not even a background dinner music . bring back the happy , swingin , cool seth , please . !
0	pretty lame .
1	the title say it all , really . i absolutely adore this song . listen to it on you tube and then you will want to buy it too !
0	i would not buy this album . there is a track missing and the new dubbs in the speaking part are terrible !
0	purchased accidentally !
1	this is a classic . anyone into hard punk should give this album a try . especially , good riddance is an amazing song . great precision and no mercy .
1	this is absolutely beautiful - especially by harp music .
0	not that good , it is a rip off .
0	not what i wa expecting , quite the opposite of what i wa hoping from this collection - looking for upbeat and postive
0	i so much wanted to love this album ; dylan a sinatra . he must really believe that he doe not sound bad , but it wa painful to listen to the off key croaking . i love dylan and i have been a fan of frank for a long time . the longing and emotion were somewhat evident , but the production quality of the cd combined with the croaking were too much . i am very disappointed but will listen again when the weather warms up and i can drive along the ocean with my window open .
1	a far a i am concerned there is no other choir that can stand up to this one . i you have ever never heard the star spanged banner sung by them it would be well worth your time to find it . p.s . i am not a mormon .
0	i have not listened to it due to technical problem .
0	all the song started sounding the same le than half way through . sad , because we really liked him on the show .
1	it wa just what i wonted to the t. the sound wa great and the price wa ok . wish it wa buy one get one .
0	did not like the way it wa sung . fortunately it wa free because i certainly would not choose to buy it .
1	it is definitely a cry shame that these guy have been together for so little time . this paris concert is a superb mix of free jazz , post-bop and avant-garde . by listening to it you can find out why chick corea is by far the best pianist ever appeared on the jazz scene since the 60 and why dave holland wa and still is one of the most important bass player in the world . barry altschul is superb a well and yes , anthony braxton is not a comfy in playing standard a his bandmates but he fit here great anyway . although being an item for accustomed ear , this is not to be missed by any real music lover .
0	most likely not the song you remember . check the preview first .
1	inspiring song , love it !
0	first of all , you can barely make out most of what they are saying . the production value are terrible . i could have done a better job with a 1980s 3 channel analog mixer in a garage with no sound buffering lining . in fact , i am pretty sure they recorded it on a 10-year-old webcam and mic set-up using sound-mixing emulation software that they obtained in a cracked version . secondly , the message is stupid . they do not really have anything worthwhile to say , and i regret wasting the time giving them a chance to change my mind . everything about this band , about this album , wa a waste of time . this is why they needed to put a photo of a blond with suggestive body tape on the cover . there is no way the music wa going to sell this album !
1	love it !
0	it is a good song but nicky minaj is featured . i do not like the way she sings
0	perv .
0	i know i should have read the information closer so my fault but - there is only one song on this cd - one song . i wa hoping to hear more from this talented artist . i wa so disappointed .
0	i am a big rage fan , and wanted the edited version to play while i drive a school bus . i paid $ 9 for all the clean version on amazon . imagine my surprise when i found they were not edited ! i contacted amazon and wa given a refund , and told them about the error . make sure you get what you pay for !
1	love this song !
0	unsuccessful purchase .
1	i absolutely love this album . i play it constantly . these song are just perfect .
1	fine cd .
1	i think this album is a huge leap forward for lifehouse . they have really grown together a a band . the song on this record are much more upbeat than on the last album , but they have not lost the depth . jason lyric express the importance of being able to look to the future and enjoy life , rather than dwelling on the past . the vocal are also much more powerful ; jason seems to be more comfortable in exploring his range and power while singing . this is evident on the track anchor , wash , and spin . on the track my precious we get to hear his amazing falsetto , and on the title track , stanley climbfall , he is absolutely electric . other highlight on the record are sky is falling , am i ever gon na find out , and take me away ; however , this is one of those album where every song is great and can be listened to over and over again . there is no need for a skip button when listening to stanley climbfall ! the overall sound of this album is very organic and pure . the song will leave you uplifted and help you to be at peace with the ups and down life throw at you . i highly recommend that you give this record a listen !
1	billy squier wa a good a anybody back in the day , wa nice just to purchase the song i wanted .
0	oddly amusing song . wa curious after hearing the song with her and new hubby chad kroeger . lyric for the younger audience , good beat !
0	i purchased the song because i wanted to hear it with both bryan may and luciano pavarotti . and pavarotti doe not sing it !
1	praise god , another sweet jam from lecrae !
1	one of the realest rapper in the game right now . j.cole ha never disappointed and this album is no exception . 2014 forest hill dive is his best album to date and best album of 2014 for sure !
1	yes it is a great song !
1	well packaged and good response . great quality , thanks !
0	no , this is not another i have been a fan of lucinda since . this or that record . ( usually wheel on a gravel road , which everyone seems to worship ) and i wa really so disappointed because she a ) mumble b ) slur or c ) is not a good a she wa on car wheel . true , i have always liked lucinda . in a world of boy band and shallow pop music she is been a constant factor , not always brilliant , but always heartfelt and sincere , providing a steady stream of decent album in the borderland between country , blue and rock . her life ha not always been easy , which is reflected in her voice . in this , her latest release , i feel that everything go wrong . it is a double cd , only 7 track on each record , most of them way too long , a if adding a few minute of instrumentals or an extra verse on each is good enough excuse to make an extra disc out of it . sure , she mumble , but that is not really the main problem . she ha always mumbled , all the way back to passionate kiss when her voice wa still young and strong . it ha never really bothered me that i needed to listen to the song a few extra time to pick up all the word . what make this album such a pain to listen to , is the music itself . the complete lack of new tune . to be honest i feel i have heard it all before . in fact i am pretty sure at least three of the song - door of heaven , i know all about it and bitter memory are pale copy of something i can only vaguely remember , and the final track faith and grace is just a 13 minute jam session gone horribly wrong . there is even a dreadful cover version of bruce springsteens factory , where she manages to take every ounce of life and soul out of what wa once a quite powerful rock ballad . some review praise her sound , which is stripped down and pretty basic . to me it sound flat , uninterested and stale , a if a group of capable studio musician have been pulled in to try to make a decent effort for the grand old lady of root music . it is the sound of old beer , tired muscle and autumn rain . it is the sound of indifference . could have been mark knopfler . could have been leonard cohen . could have been the soundtrack of just about any ageing musician whose spirit is fading and the only thing left is to get done with the job . ha lucinda finally lost it ? have all the year of boozing and shorting finally taken it toll ? this is supposed to be a concept album of the highway 20 , and maybe it wa just an idea gone wrong , something she felt strongly to make although the idea wa better than the song that came out of it ? i liked her previous album , where she had more than enough song to make it a double . i liked little honey and i liked sweet old world better than car wheel . ( although i might be accused of blasphemy for saying so ) . and in a world where good and original songwriter are few and far between , i still hope and believe that lucinda ha it in her . this one , however , wa just a big yawn to me .
1	i heard this on kjzz , my favorite for jazz music , and liked it well enough to get the mp3 version .
1	wonderful !
0	advertised a the explicit , non edited version and it is not , it is the radio version . waste of $ 0.99 . i need more word .
1	i am jockin on these hater , man . this song is a euphoric mix of culture + party . five star .
0	not able to listen the cd is blank
1	this music relaxes and soothes . i am anxiously awaiting the next damien escobar cd .
0	this song wither did not load on the player correctly or is only weekday the sample is . either way , i am not pleased with it at alp
0	it is just a preference . it is not my cup of tea that is all . too heavy going for young child i think .
1	great group !
1	i love this song , waiting for more from oaktowns 3-5-7. this song pump me up everttime . let do it my friend
1	anything that patti labelle sings can not be bad ! i loved this song when she and michael mcdonald first recorded it , on separate coast , and i still love it ! wonderful album ! maryg
1	this is a awesome cd . full of cruchy guitar , dual solo , thumping bass and pounding drum . everything tou would expect from stryper and more !
1	it wa amazing !
0	i only heard 1 song off the album but sometimes i wait i do not want something i cant give back , i like to give but i do not want to give back better save your money , i heard a song i did not like , i only heard 1 song off the album , better save your money
0	sound quality very low ! but a great classic song !
1	some awesome song here .
1	phenomenal 1974 recording on 20th century record from the great pianist ahmad jamal with the other two member of his trio , jamil nasser on bass and frank gant on drum , along with azzedin weston in a very prominent role on conga , and a beautiful string and horn section arranged by richard evans . all six selection on the album were written by ahmad and he produced it a well . jamal play jamal is a classic that ha yet to be officially released on cd . it command premium $ in the collector market , and ha been sampled over the year by many other musician . i remember when i had the 8-track ( ! ) of this back in the 70 that i played to death - still have a mint condition vinyl copy ( and cover ) that i guard with my life . if it doe not come out on cd soon , i will get it professionally transferred over to the cd format , which i have done with many out-of-print vinyl album still unavailable on cd . this one is long overdue and certainly deserves it . the writing , arranging , and playing on jamal play jamal is superb , with ahmad alternating between steinway grand piano and fender rhodes with the marvelous background horn and string by evans . two of the piece , pasture and death & resurrection , are particularly sub- lime with brilliant interplay between jamal and the orchestra . eclipse , dialogue , and spanish interlude are all stellar example of ahmads exemplary composing and arranging skill , a well . my favorite piece on the album , swahililand , is also the longest at almost ten minute and is an extended , magnificent opus featuring a gorgeous three minute introductory setup by jamal on his steinway with the background horn and string before he kick in with the main section on fender rhodes . weston is astounding on conga al- ternating from left channel to right . jamal then finish the piece back on the steinway after it wind down from the tour-de-force . it is the final track on the album and close it out in fine fashion - extraordinary and fabulous work from all involved . the whole recording is a masterpiece of writing , arranging , and playing that wa beautifully recorded by engineer tony may and paul serrano . i have an extensive collection of jamals output over the year and dearly love his early impulse work , but jamal play jamal is my favorite of his . a stellar work of art that , once again , is long overdue for cd release . another desert island disc . p.s . had my vinyl copy of jamal play jamal professionally converted to cd including the front and back album cover . sound better than ever !
0	by far the worst s * i have heard in a long time . poser wan na be should just give it up . fail .
1	it is great , i love the whole cd
1	i think this is a great album . there is not one song i dislike on this cd . i defiantly recommend buying this album .
1	i have listened to this over and over and love it every time . it is a wonderful song , especially for easter . thanks
1	this review is for the vinyl lp version . definitely not disappointed with this pressing , first off it is heavy , it feel even heavier than 180 gram . the mastering also seems pretty good , drum are tight and high are bright , the saxophone especially shine . the stereophonics are just a good and the sound stage feel quite broad even with my closed back headphone . my favorite part about this gatefold is that while all the song could have likely been compressed onto one lp , they were not . this leaf a good third or so empty space on each side , which really minimizes inner-groove distortion . on my setup the last song louder than word ( the only with vocal ) there did seem to be a bit of sibilance but that fault may lie with my cartridge alignment . a far a the actual music , i have only listened through it once so far , spoiler alert : the first vocal are a stephen hawking solo on the track talkin hawkin about 2/3rds of the way through . the energy throughout is very calm and soothing , there are no power rift like are present in momentary lapse , this is more like obscured by cloud . there is really nothing on this album that would be suited towards being played on the radio , and that is because it is one of those album that is obviously meant to be listened to a a whole , it is really hard to tell where one song end and the next begin through almost the whole album . overall it is nothing spectacular , but it is a well put together album and very easy on the ear , a great choice if you are looking to wind down after a long day . a must have for any big floyd fan or collector . i feel i will appreciate it even more after additional listening .
0	zorro is ok - the rest is quirky but poor .
0	i can not imagine why i would order this . my wife must have done this . the song is trite . the lyric are predictable . if you love mope rock , this song is for you !
1	i wanted a song that reminded me of our different cruise and this song doe it for me , it brings back all the memory
1	have one thing to say , i love this song and listen to it every day . this song is a must have . very relaxing .
0	this guy is terrific . however , this cd and his other solo album ramin are exactly the same in content . every song on one is on the other in the exact order . and i bought both thinking they would be different . really disappointed that i bought the same cd twice with separate title . great performer . probably a decent guy . but let u take one of those off the market ! it make this extraordinary artist look like either a business amateur or sneaky .
1	i absolutely love this song . they sound awesome together . being a woman with a busy job and a husband with the same this song make complete sense to me .
0	if you are a big fan of trivium style on their first two cd , then do not even bother with this album . not too long before this cd came out , trivium covered metallicas master of puppet . in all honesty , the song rock ! but it is my suspicion that recording the cover song gave trivium some abhorrent notion to make an album entirely in the vein of metallica . this new album is a complete letdown . trivium ha such an awesome sound on ascendancy , and for them to abandon that completely to attempt to fulfill their childhood dream of playing in metallica is , frankly , depressing . from a fan whole absolutely love their first two effort , i give this album two thumb down ! please , for the love of ( insert your chosen deity or spiritual force here ) , revert back to your original sound , trivium !
1	i like it . just what we expected .
1	all of phyllis hymans song made me cry . even this one . beautifully sung . www.k-mille.net
0	this make no sense . note to god is not an original song from charice . the song is from jojos album the highroad that came out in 2006. for charice to say this is her song and not expect people to know it not make no sense . i am a very big fan of jojo but not so much of charice anymore .
0	this cd wa bought by mistake by me , doh ! so you know , this is a different guy . i guess if you like cheesy r & b/rap lite , it is ok. could not get through the 2nd song myself- sure he look different , but thought it wa early & a bad pic , haha- oh well . buy both of the real sean rowe cd or lp , they are killer !
0	a disappointment compared to other beegie adair performance . i felt so woosie i could not even listen to it .
1	doe anyone remember larry gowan ? fan do . this collection of song span his early career with all the best music . gowan is a canadian singer and songwriter . never one for ballad , his music is quite original and thought provoking . this album doe have a few song that would be considered ballad . i guess gowan ha mellowed a bit . since 1999 gowan is still performing . now with the band styx . never-the-less it is his early year i remember with fondness . this album is the best of gowan .
1	love it !
1	this song is musically beautiful , and the lyric seem to speak to me far too often . cyndi laupers voice is expressive and this song is so touching .
0	this album wa a huge letdown . it is way too melodic and popish / commercial light rock . being a huge fan of all that remains , owning all of their other album & having gone to their show , this album wa a major disappointment . melodic can be cool if it is still heavy like on their older album but this album wa not nearly heavy enough for me . i do not like the direction they have gone in . i liked the first single they released which prompted me to purchase this album but the rest of it wa dissatisfactory . i do not recommend this album to hardcore and metalcore fan .
0	stanley climbfall had some big shoe to fill , a job that it failed to accomplish . this is nowhere near the lifehouse quality that wa shown on no name face . talk about a sophmore slump ! the first singe spin is pretty good , a is the title track . the best track on the record is take me away , it is beautiful ! unfortunately i can not say the same for the rest of this cd . that is junk !
0	the 2014 remaster is terrible . like so much music remastered these day for mp3 player , it is completely oversaturated , so that the sound is compressed and distorted , and there is almost no dynamic range . the sound file look like a brick . this type of remaster is what give digital sound a bad name and make people long for vinyl . it is perfectly possible to make a great digital remaster , but this is not one of them . boo !
1	i agree with the other reviewer that this is a very warm recording , which is often far from modern convention . i personally think this is one of the best that i have heard of . the sound is tonally beautiful and lyrical . maybe martzy is a bit on the same page with haendel and grumiaux . quite far from heifetz , milstein and younger violinist . if you like more objective style , this is not the best option . stay with szeryng or milstein .
1	how can you go wrong with music by earth wind & fire . this phenomenal band ha a unique sound that make everyone - young and old - get up a move .
0	i have ordered 2 time the same product from amazon and the 5th track had a problem on both .
0	derosa wa never funny but road the coattail of opie and anthony to mediocre success . with that gone , my guess is he will be doing open mike night and selling dime bag in 2 year while staying with andy kindler in his studio
0	she can not even do a soft song without it being at the schubert or oneil theater . i would suggest you get the ala carte from her massive library here at itunes . there are some great thing .
1	i love this song !
1	this brings me back to my younger year - my college day when ll wa still my boo : - ) i have grown up since then but i still love this song .
0	i am sure he ha other good cd , but i have not found it yet .
0	the two song i really wanted to hear are not on it ; what a waste of money ; is the other music good ? sure , but the missing song make it a big disappointment .
1	this item exceeded expectation ! bought a a gift for a family member for enjoyment and daily use . recommend this item .
1	this band ha a great sound & this is a very unique , fun christmas song . love the stringed instrument & old big band feel .
1	i am very happy with this cd .
0	never received it ! had previous review for other song but only noticed 17 at that time . now i see all these . just copy and paste the other review for everything cuz same comment apply : - ( - had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh ! close to $ 100 worth of music never received !
1	i use to hear that song without knowing the title . i finally found it and i am enjoying it . thanks to amazon for making purchase so easy and good quality music .
0	a big disappointment . purchased based on the high praise it received in a recent aarp magazine publication .
0	i am all for freedom of speech , but this song is just shock value . not impressed .
0	my own throat feel strained listening to mr. dylan struggle through this genre . it is not for him . the sweet backup singer just do not help , and almost seem comical a counterpart to the raspy/harsh voice of this rebel-icon . if i were a little kid , i would run and hide my head under the pillow rather than listen . actually , i may do that myself .
0	i really do not appreciate amazon not allowing u to use our reward dollar available on our credit card when we buy mp3s . i do not accrue that many reward credit on my credit card , it would be much more fair if we could use those towards mp3 purchase .
0	could not get it to play . tried on every player i could find .
1	i am not sure a i can recommend this title any more than my fellow enthusiast , but herere my thought . in the trend of cd re-releases of classic gospel amazing grace , the complete recording offer more than one take on many tune . and that is a good thing ! the best way to enjoy good gospel more is to listen to it again . and since these are live recording , the spirit move and move . i love aretha , especially here . her voice and spirit soar and we are taken with them . the reverend move u in the way only he can . and let me take a moment here to offer a hallelujah and amen ! for the 1972 southern california community choir . they are with the leader at every turn and their love for our lord come shining through . and that is what a good gospel choir is , my friend . thank you , lord . praise jesus .
0	ton of scratch and record skip .
1	best version of one of my favorite song that i have ever heard . watch it with video on youtube to take in the whole scenario , visually stunning a well a a joy to listen to .
1	it is hard to single out the best pop album that most people have never heard . there are so many worthy candidate . big star radio city get mentioned a lot . t.rexs electric warrior come to mind . but the frontrunner from the 90 ha got to be mezzanine , a genre-bending goldmine that both elevated trip hop to a new level and destroyed it in the same instant . destroyed it for the simple reason that no one could follow this without paling in comparison . each track shine in turn . whether it is the single , teardrop , with elizabeth frasers ethereal vocal , or the heavy-rock inflected angel and dissolved girl , or the epic show-stopper group four , massive seems a a group with no limitation . and even rap-haters can appreciate 3-d low key , almost whispered rhyme on inertia creep and risingson . i would particularly recommend this album to rock fan who have considered dipping a toe into the pool of electronic music , but were not sure where to start . this one is can not -miss .
0	a vile song from a vile album that glorifies adultery and a family destroyed . leanns action during and after her affair ha cost her many fans-me being one of them .
1	great song
0	dissapointed with this one . love johnny cash but the sound on this one is not good . sorry that i downloaded it to my kindle .
0	this wa a single cd and if i would have known that i would have not ever purchased it . thanks
1	i recommend this product to anyone who enjoys barbra streisand and the movie , the way we were . i chose this because i love her voice and i like the song .
0	a ha been mentioned in other review , these are not the original hit recording . most , if not all , of the original are available elsewhere .
1	thank you wilco !
1	the disc came shortly after i ordered it , and ha been very impressive ever since . this young british maestro definitely ha this score well under his skin . the vienna philharmonic play splendedly , especially the lovely ending in the final movement .
0	i expected more musical growth from the band .
0	ok , jason moran is a piano virtuoso . if you still did not know , this is a reason to listen to this work . the problem come when you are looking for something else . this album is a jazz trio , but what about the other two ? well , overshadowed by the soloist . although better that way , and i would be pleased if they would not try to make so much noise : the truth is that if one is attentive to the bass and the drum will soon be disappointed . to top it off , the theme included in this album are dull and flat .
1	very good album
0	van halen were never great nor prolific songwriter , mostly a good cover band with a livewire , athletic showman up front and one of the best speed merchant guitar player in the history of rock . probably a great bar band when they started out . i saw them twice in their early day , when i wa a teenager who did not care that dlr wa a mediocre singer at best . loved his energy and the musical chop of the rest of the band . unfortunately , whatever vocal talent he ever possessed , ha long since evaporated . david lee roth is not merely bad in the way that many so called rock vocalist of the 70 were bad , nor in the way that many older rock icon like springsteen and dylan lose their limited vocal appeal a they get older - he is the type of absolutely horrible singer who should never be permitted within 10 foot of a microphone . worse still , he clearly know it , and rather than try harder , he doe not even try to get the lyric or his phrasing correct . lazier vocal than jagger or steve tyler ever attempted even at their nadir . inexcusable that van halen have released this on the unsuspecting public !
1	an excellent series with a theme that really capture the feel of the series . definately recommend especially to lover of the series
1	the piano is very subtle and haunting almost i love the pause in between and the beat . it all gel together . i love the song , buy in !
0	it sound like she wa making it up a she went along .
0	6 star for the song , zero star for amazon help ( or lack of : ) in locating it on my computer . what can i say ? i like this tune a lot . buying it here wasnt that smart because i still have not found it on my computer and amazon help could not help me find it . shrug ? i ended up getting it from another website so it doenst really matter i guess .
0	awful . doe not sound right at all . i would love my.money back if i could figure out how
0	i downloaded this song twice and both time the lead singer channel had much le volume than the version i reviewed . almost like the right-left channel were not set the same . somebody need to have a look at the setting on this download .
1	ignoring her ridiculous behavior and wardrobe , this song is not only catchy , but powerful and sang really well . i absolutely love it and can listen to it over and over . excited for the full album !
1	yes ! yes ! yes !
1	awesome reminder of the love of god !
0	i bought this version before i saw that the u.s. navy band had also recorded the irish national anthem . the navy band version , in my opinion , is much better . more upbeat .
1	another great song by matthew west ! this song can reach so many people , because everyone ha felt regret and despair .
1	excellent album , prompt delivery .
1	why do not we see this chick on tv ? i have heard her only occasionally on the radio , and her rendition are so smooth and sentimental . so well-done that she should be way on top !
1	okay , after using that annoying pun , allow me to elaborate a little bit : lee greenwood is one hell of a performer ! i have to admit , this is the first album of his i have bought ; and no , in case you are wondering , the inclusion of god bless the usa had no effect on my choosing to purchase this cd ( it did not hurt thing , though ) . i will get right to the album , save yall any more small talk . i wa expecting some more of greenwood songwriting ; after all , usa is a superbly written song . i wasnt expecting these sleek number from mainstream nasvhille songwriter . that is the bad thing . the good thing is , greenwood voice is rich and pure . he take these songs- absolutely meaningless and trivial in the hand of any other singer- and turn them into something memorable . most of em deal with love , of course ; it almost make me glad is a heartbreaker , while one life to love barely avoids the cliche and when a woman in love is a fun look at how woman feel when their heart get all fluttery ( at least , from a man perspective ) . rock that you can not move is about getting on with life through the hardship ; round here take a look at small town . and the new excellent , emotional version of god bless the usa is a patriotic and moving a ever . lee greenwood is not trying anything new here . this is territory that is been traversed before , to be sure . but his voice is unique ; his sense of timing and style is un-matched . aside from the excess photography ( not badly done , but unnecessary ) , this album is a musical gem . it may not be stronger than time , but it is definitely the album of the moment . so , to continue on with the cliche : seize the moment , and along with it , lee greenwood stronger than time !
1	another one my mom got to enjoy for awhile before it wa passed back to me because mom and she ha now gone home herself yo heaven
1	these remixes are slammin ! you will dance and laugh outloud . warning ! this stuff is explicit . headphone at work , and in public , are reccommended . jonny mcgovern is genious . the remix of do not fall in love with a homo took his already riotous , totally barry white inspired , slow jam and made it a dance club classic . check it out . you must .
1	excellent song and very spirited .
0	what can i say ? it is absolutely maddening to learn that the super deluxe edition of this cd doe not contain all of the song released for this album . apparently , there is another regular deluxe version containing three song not available here . what complete jibberish . how can you ask someone to pay an extraordinary premium for the super deluxe version and then not provide all planned content for release ? while i would love to say i am shocked mr. taylor would sanction this , it is apparently one of the many new , le than desirable trend the record company have espoused lately to get those few of u left who support physical medium to shell out more dough . disgusting .
1	play it all time . love it
1	this is nice song from my day of growing up in the 70 and still is a good song .
0	heard this on a movie and really dug the lyric . have not really listened to it since i downloaded it . the intro wa too long for me , and i do not like the vocal they are shaky like there is hardly any talent . once i heard the whole song the lyric are not a impressive a when i heard it on the movie .
0	ok relaxation music - but it just doe not do it for me a a go to sleep cd climb into bed and nod off
0	i just came here to read the description , trying to figure out why this showed up on a prime search for christian music . three is nothing christian about it . if anything it is new age .
0	i did not like any of this music . terrible selection . i am going to try and get a refund for this purchase .
0	this is the worst description on the south i have ever heard my recommendation to any true southern is do not by this disgusting garbage i can not package it up fast enough to get it out of my house .
0	i purchased this remastered lp to replace my worn out 30 year old mobile fidelity vinyl copy of from the mar hotel and have to say that while i am a fan of most of friday music reissue this remaster sound like it wa transferred directly from a digital source such a a cd straight to lp . it sound bright and forward from the very start to end and i have an warm sounding all tube preamp . my old mobile fidelity japan pressed 30 year old copy sound much more natural and is superior in almost every way . in fact i panicked and bought a used mint copy on amazon from a wonderful seller a few day later . earlier last year mofi wa supposed to re-release this album on lp but decided not to at the last minute and friday music picked up the licensing right instead . this reissue is not all bad though , a i found phil leshs bass guitar sounded very full and rich throughout the recording and the lp is indeed a very quiet pressing at 180 gram . it wa pressed at rti in california and very good quality control standard were obviously taken by the staff that produced this recording .
1	this album is dope . wasnt really a fan of j. cole until his last album , this album will have me purchasing all of his album from now on . excellent lyric , production is outstanding . definitely one of the year best hip hop release .
0	doe a self-inflicted hole in the head make one a better musician ? i thought not , so let u drop the charade that kurt cobain is a legend . if nirvana and kurt cobain were the be-all , end-all of the music scene , it would not have continued to evolve much le thrive after cobain took the cowardly way out of life ten year ago . this prof that cobain wa unimportant to the music world . look for yourself and try to find any contribution he brought to music . when you see it in it totality , his mark on the rock music scene wa minimal , and his mark the music scene a a whole wa detrimental . most music in general is stagnant because it continues to include kurt cobain a an essential influence , but rock is regressing because cobain is the man who allowed nu-metal and hate-rock to be bore from nirvana . nirvana had none of the passion , drive , and true grit that make honest musician stand out . nirvana fan confuse laziness and sloppy musicianship with pure honesty just because kurt say that is what it is . that is how easily-duped they are . when i see kurt cobain compared alongside jimi hendrix , bob dylan , and john lennon , i find it sickening because cobain , a he is been anointed by his fan and critic alike , is king of the slacker . he wa a lazy opportunist who fed off his legend status to finance his heroine habit . a modern musician and artist i have stumbled upon recently is tracey chapman . unlike cobain , she truly could lend her voice for the persecuted because she herself ha been persecuted . she spoke of all the desolation kurt cobain never faced but claimed he had . she spoke of inciting a revolution for the poor to rise and gain what they had been denied ; kurt cobain just wanted to incite a revolution for spoiled middle-class kid from divorced parent to gain what they never were entitled to . traceys wail could both move people to tear and prove injustice of the downtrodden all at once . could kurt cobain honesty do any of those thing ? no . when getting into music , i suggest anything besides whiny nasal band , nirvana , pop-punk , and any form of metal , especially for younger people getting into the music scene . if you read that and ask , what else is there to choose from , i think the you have given in to the medium already . once teen discover kurt cobain , they think that just because the medium and stuffy critic say so , that there is nothing beyond him , which is a lie . i saw bypass him and nirvana altogether . i recommend : tracey chapman , the cranberry , the b-52 , the beatles , john lennon , bob dylan , the moody blue , and anything else experimental or strange . nirvana wa just lazy .
0	i read some sterling review and finaly tracked down this rare cd . no idea why the review were so impressive . someone mentioned srv and hendrix in the same breath - pure insult . his vocal are very poor , but are still better than the frantic noodling that pass for solo on this poor offering . how you can butcher something a basic a roadhouse blue is beyond me . his guitar playing ha absolutely no direction and his tone is a 60isch fuzztone that sound ancient . all the solo are pointless finger exercise . there are about 800 or so better player in my collection and this one ha not one redeeming feature . try rhett tyler or michael katon for some sizzling blue guitar .
1	exceptional album , amazing video .
0	not even going to bother with this unless they are 320kb quality . why even bother with something low quality ? seriously .
1	beautiful song ! worship worship worship ! amen .
0	the sound quality is poor . youtube ha a version by beecham and the royal philharmonic with much better quality .
0	i am very disappointed i thought this wa posted be a regular size cd i had no idea this wa a mini cd and i do not have a mini cd player at all so i could not even use this i am very disappointed on my purchase them to keep u posted on line i had the right to if i give it a one star rating i thought this wa post be a regular size cd i waste my money nobody should not buy this because you are gon na be disappointed when you receive it
1	christina and blake sound wonderful together ! who would have guessed it . : )
0	not a great a his previous cd , some great tune but mostly a disappointment . i enjoyed his first cd and maybe an mp3 would best suit you .
1	the legend is back ! best bluegrass ever ! doyle lawson & quicksilver know how bluegrass must be performed ! this album make fun of more from these group .
1	jonathan sprout performed at my school when i wa six , and my mother bought me a cassette tape of on the radio . i listened to that tape until it finally broke after year and year of rewinding and replaying , so i wa delighted to come across the digital version of this album on amazon .
1	love this corney song i play for anyones birthday
1	this is a great song . worth having in your collection . fast and easy download . able to sample before you buy . i love this about amazon
1	nice
0	honestly this album is really disappointing . i will say to you just go back to alaska and explore your root again ! take care !
1	great remix of one of the key song of the show give a great feeling to a strong show number
0	acck ! michael allen harrison is a wonderful pianist but with saw . run and hide ! it sound like . sorta like weird whistling . if the sawing wa taken out it would have been an o.k album . i rated it 1 star because there wa no -200 star . : ( . all of the song sound the same and all of them are terrible . i think the person that is sawing or whatever made a good effort to actually make the saw or whatever sound a note but it wa still bad . if you are wondering , this cd wa free at the michael allen harrison christmas concert and i thought it would be decent . the one we paid for were very good though . i guess i found out the purpose of free cd .
0	first off , i would like to say that i commend jewel with trying something a little different and experimenting with a new sound . it must get quite boring with recording the same type of music all the time , i imagine it would have been pretty easy for her to record an album consiting of spirit type folky song . on the other hand , i do not really like this album . a few song i do like and i do enjoy listening to , but i do not get far in when i have to skip track . stand intuition and haunted are worth listening to , but the other song are sub standard . they consist of poor lyric , dodgy music and ridiculous spelling . this way is by far jewel best album , i thought it signified a new rockier edge to her music but she seems to have abandoned that route . i hope on the next album jewel is back playing instrument , writing thoughtful music and singing her heart out . this album would be a fantastic album for a young new teeny bopper to record and release but i expect something different from jewel , something which is actually credible . leave this to britney , mandy and jessica . oh and jewel , keep your clothes on . it not big , and it not clever ! you do not need to sell your body to sell record .
1	just about everything this man writes is better than the last .
0	lame , anyone who buy this is clearly an idiot . nigg * over and over and over to annoying craptastic beat . rap suck .
1	air return with love 2 - their best work , in my opinion , since 1998s moon safari . the french duo have taken a more experimental approach to this album - often delving amongst walls-of-sound ( do the joy ) and synth-driven scope ( be a bee ) . alternatively , the album offer perhaps air more accessible pop-tune to date with sing sang sung . with this type of contrast ( notable from quite an early stage on the album ) one ha to expect some surprise along the way . do the joy - an odd track to start the album with . nonetheless , a good indicator of the album flow and overall feel . the song sound like something from 10,000 hz legend , with it is multi-layered synth forefront and distorted voice effect . not the album strongest but interesting and innovative at the very least . 7/10 love - once again , not your typical second song . it hold a sense of simplicity though , and a the song progress it turn from a basic loop into a nice , soft-like piece with a great chord progression and melody ( the glockenspiel add an awesome feel ) . sound like something you would hear at the end of moon safari - especially the later half of the piece . it wasnt my favourite at first , but after a few listens it grew on me . 7/10 so light is her football - the first song to really feature lyrical dynamic . the music sound pocket symphony era , with the song being driven by piano and hovering string . i heard ( or read ) somewhere that this will be the second single off the album . an odd decision i believe , but who know - maybe it need more listens . the song seems a little bland at some point , but hold suspense from an instrumentation point of view . 6/10 be a bee - definitely not a song you would think air would produce . with it is western-like feel , the song sound like something off a surfing documentary . it is fun but also lack differentiation ( on all front ) . it could have done with some structuring overhauling . not the greatest song on the album but hey - that is something you will probably be use to at this stage , right ? 6/10 missing the light of the day - an interesting tune with some rather unique sound . if you have ever seen air live you would know what i am talking about . they seem to produce some pretty funky patch throughout their set , and this song is a pretty good indicator of that . if you have heard any of brian enos earlier album you could make a comparison with this song psuedo-alternatuve twist . nothing overly exciting , but a worthwhile listen . 7/10 tropical disease - the album longest tune and one of the best , in my opinion . contrary to what i have mention so far with regard to lyrical absence , i have always been one to fancy air instrumental track . i believe it take a higher-level degree of musical integrity to produce a track that satisfies your audience , depending entirely on instrumentation and dynamical-presence . the song sound like two turned into one . the first half is up beat and ha a similar essence to be a bee . a it progress it slows down into an ambient plateau , reminiscent of something off talkie walkie . 8/10 heaven light - definitely one of the album standout track . itd be right at home with the like of la femme dargent and ce matin la . probably the album most chill-out number , with it is swirling progression ( especially towards the middle half ) and heavenly vocal scene . my personal favorite and a seamlessly perfect ambient tune . 10/10 night hunter - another instrumental track with a great beat to it . cross the electronica soundscapes of 10,000 hz legend and add the piano-driven feel of ( the majority of ) pocket symphony and you have this great combination of ambience and almost down-tempo-like rhythm . a great addition to the second half of the album and an homage to the lighter side of air . 9/10 sing sang sung - well what can we say about this ! easily air most accessible pop-song to date with an amazing effort from the boy and their female vocalist . with a musical infusion that sound like something from a tlpopmusik album , this number is easily one of the best on the entire album . simple yet so effective in it delivery . there is just enough contrast between chorus , verse and so on to give the tune a refreshing feel . if you are going to get someone into this album , nay , air themselves , this might be a good starting point ! 10/10 eat my beat - one of the shortest on the album . the song is a good break from the ambient/instrumental-driven latter half of the album . with it is brewing crescendo mid day through the piece , it introduces an awesome little synth melody line which is bound to engage further interest . 8/10 you can tell it to everybody - an awesome chill-out track to begin the closing stage of the album . once again , i find myself being reminded of the later half of moon safari with this one . ` new star in the sky ( chanson pour solal ) would have this a it is little sister . acoustic and laid-back in it is approach , this tune is a near perfect night song . with it is distorted harmonica interlude , it is bound to sooth whatever sorrow you are experiencing and take you to a calmer place . 9/10 african velvet - whilst at first this may not seem like your average album closer , african velvet is probably one of the most interesting track on the album . with it is hand-picked guitar segment , and it is front-line horn melody , it is a perfect way to close of this special album . with a smooth bass line , hinting the like of la femme dargent , velvet will undoubtedly spark interest and keep you listening to the last note . a great way to close off love 2 . 8/10 i gave this effort from air four star in the end . but i am not ruing out a higher score . it is definitely an album that need a few listens for it to really soak in . not a accessible a their earlier album , but for anyone who is been hanging for a different approach fomr these french ambient-masters , your wait is over . if i could relate it to any album previously released , i would say 10,000 hz legend . on one hand this album may be sour for fan of air more chill-out tune , but on the other ` love 2 ha the making of attracting a whole new market/denomination of listener from all corner of the music globe . give it a go and do not give up after a few listens . itll grow on you . trust me !
1	outstanding , bluish .
0	i did not realize that i had this song available to me until i saw it in the list of item that i supposedly bought and then when i read the other review and found out it is a free download i decided to listen to it . i listened for about 20 second , clicked it off and laughed out loud at how amateurish and awful this song is . yes , that is why it is free !
1	love love love
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	another stellar album from the awesome jenny ! beautiful and finely crafter all the way through !
1	love it
0	did not work , not one song . will not buy here ahain
0	wow , what a load of garbage . if you watch the movie , the music might make sense . a a stand-alone experience without the visual side to accompany it , the album is an epic fail . the cellist , dave eggar , might be accomplished and all , but that doe not really come across on this album . and if you are a fan of amy lee or evanescence , there is nothing to see here . amys vocal appear on maybe 5 % of the whopping 30 minute the album play for . the one song amy wrote for the album , push the button , is easily the effort worst track . sounding like a weird techno piece that someone forgot behind the dj in ibiza , it is completely out of place on the album a a whole . stay clear of this piece of crap .
1	great song ! i have always liked crow , so that is no surprise . you would think ! but believe me , i wa surprised to hear sheryls voice accompanying this music during the end credit to the film k-pax . it wa so unlike the many other hit she ha released over the year . the music itself is no different from the beautiful and spacy score that enveloped the movie nicely . the only other song in the movie is elton john rocket man , a classic . unfortunately these two track were excluded from the soundtrack . it is just the score . so look elsewhere for this great song ! trust me , you will not be disappointed .
0	i saw this song and artist on octane from sirius xm . whatever i bought is not it . these guy seem very angry .
1	i heard this song on the radio and loved it . it really make you think if jesus wa never born we would not have christmas . jesus is the reason for the season and this song reminds u all of that .
1	good 1st lp . each song is good and it is quite enjoyable .
0	dear fireflight , please release electro-pop under another name or a side project . this will , i believe , alienate your current fan , i know it ha me . if i wanted christian katy perry , then i would listen to , uh , old katy perry .
0	i thought that the song wa going to be adam singing it and once i heard a clip of it on itunes . i realized that it wasnt him a all ( from the very beginning of it ) . i did not like the song just from the clip i heard . if you ask me , this group or singer sin synthetic , are just trying to make money off of adam lambert name and his fame . i almost bought the cd here from amazon . i am so glad that i did not .
1	very good quality , price & delivery , well done !
0	do not buy this particular version if you are looking for the explicit version . this version is an edited or radio version .
1	what can i say , a massively favorite song . to get the favorite recording of this i had to purchase instead of use amazon prime streaming , but . it lead my mellowing out playlist . it also is that song from the famous volvo split commercial .
1	for my mp3 player
1	excellent
1	nice mellow song about reminiscing about day gone by what could have been if feeling between two people had been in sync .
1	this is a great song to start off your friday . i listen to it on the way to the office every friday morning . set the day to be a positive experience no matter how your day end . great song .
0	this is a very superb piece of worship music ! except that it is cut at the end . tragic end for such a fine piece of music . this music is on a par with heilig , by schubert , sung by the choir of trinity college , cambridge . these two are in a class by themselves a beyond superb . however , this one is ruined by being cut short at the end , before the music is finished .
0	heard him singing with his mom on her album and had to hear what else he had to offer . not much ! he gave it his all when singing with her , but he sounded a little bored with the whole thing on his own album . did not sound a though he wa giving it his all ! sorry !
0	what is it with this guy ? will he ever have the gut to release another album without a greatest hit package tagged onto this new material . this guy for 10 year ha re-released the same old music ! the one time he did not with a $ 70 million budget , invincible only sold 2 million copy in the usa . even though his $ 70 million budget wa directed to only marketing in the usa . why doe not everyone go to cnet.com , go to the downloads section & get yourself a free mp3 cd ripper ! then get jackson first 4 solo album or really any of his album , make copy of them & then burn your own cd of your own personal choice of song ! that in a nutshell is what michael jackson ha done for 10 year ! he know his new stuff cant stand on it own so then we need greatest hit package tagged on or just release : box set , number one , etc , etc . i have never seen another guy live off his past more then him ! word to the wise , get yourself a free mp3/cd ripper , rip your already owned old material and make your own cd with different selection . because that is all he is doing !
0	frankly , i have no idea what the other review is trying to say . however , i will issue a caution to anyone considering purchasing this track : notice that this is a remix of level , and not the version you probably know from the radio . if you are a dj , this could be a great addition to your collection . if not , well , this might be what you are looking for anyway : just be warned that this remix is pretty mind-numbingly repetitive .
1	love this and keep it on my kindle and play over and over again . have this on a cd also in my car . quite beautiful !
0	not my type of music .
1	i am so in love with this song . clay vocal surpass in this beautifully written song . if you have not bought it yet , go buy it . you will love it also !
1	very smooth ! keep the music going brother , do not sellout to the usher , rkelleys r & b of mainstream etc . stay pure .
0	a a fan of tso . we were looking forward to this new 2 cd set with great anticipation . when it arrived , we immediately slid it into the cd player and were very surprised and disappointed . although we realize it is the latest in a stream of concept release by tso , this concept left u very cool . there is very little that is melodic and a lot of it seems like just so much noise . we are pretty sophisticated listener with extremely diverse musical taste , but i must say this one wa a bust . we never listen to it and had we previewed it , would definitely never have purchased it .
0	this is an original artist remake . if you want the original version of this song click here > & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/one-more-try/dp/b002sz2z80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > one more try < /a >
1	thank you
0	disappointing ; very much mor type music . not what i had hoped for , sadly .
0	i am not sure what those who gave this 4 or 5 star are thinking . this is awful ! i realize there will always be sycophant of certain band who are so enamored with them they will always rate 5 star when it is painfully obvious 5 star are not in order . this is certainly one of those time . this cd is horrific , and that is being charitable . i love old van halen - they are among my all-time faves . but this ? who , in their right mind , can give this crap 3 star , much le 4 or 5 ? dlr sound terrible ! reprehensible . i will not even go into the sammy v david argument since i never really cared for the hagar year . i love sammy a a solo artist , but did not care for his work with van halen , but i prefer his mediocre work with them to roth garbage now .
1	old school music . the best from puerto rico . isla del encanto . bonita perla bonito san juan buenos recuerdos del pasado
0	very disappointed did not even have the star spangled banner
0	pop
0	i downloaded the amazon player and everything and it will not play . waste of my 0.89 ! i will stick with itunes from now on .
0	not the best stuff from either artist
1	a great classic from curtis mayfield . grew up listening to his musical creation and have always been in awe . fantastic
0	actually , to say , i do not like it is not totally accurate . it is more than just tolerable , but i guess i wa expecting something more than i got .
1	i can listen to this one over and over again .
0	clicked on this too quickly before noticing it is not the original .
1	one of my lil boy favorite !
1	love it .
0	after i had heard david gilmore talk about this project , i have to admit , i wa excited to get my hand on this box set , from one of my fav . band . i could not even get through 12 song before i realized , what a collection of cutting room floor garbage this crap is . david and nick are banking on the popularity of floyd , to sell this garbage , and will probably do well with their past image . i find nothing new or even the slightest bit interesting about the music on this disc . the two song done on the dvd disc , ( which i have not watched yet ) might be the only good thing about this disc collection . the booklet is kind of ok , but even that is not worth the price you pay . if you feel you must have this , i suggest you wait a couple of year , and you can get a used copy ( only played once ) for very cheap . in fact , you can have mine for 3 dollar . lol
1	love ryan adam . and now i love taylor swift . i bought both cd !

1	great cd at bargain price .
0	after an adequate if a little bland debut album , i expected and anticipated great thing from lifehouse . although second album are known to be difficult , i beleived the band to have promise . how wrong wa i. there is not a single song on here that life up to the standard of any of those on no name face . it all highly irritating , mediocre and thoughroughly tuneless . i have a very varied taste in music and i do know a melody when it come my way , but there is no melody on this album worth writing about . i write this to stop others making the same mistake i did , and if you like lifehouse because of no name face , trust me stay away from this so you still have some love for the band . switchfoot , vertical horizon , jimmy eat world even the calling ( whose album i also think suffers from having only one good song on it but is still better than this drivel ) are in a class of their own when compared to lifehouse im afraid . spend your money and time elsewhere .
1	1968 wa a year filled with social unrest , and the music in this hour-long cd reflects that . from the blaring guitar and driving beat of the opening selection , born to be wild by steppenwolf , to the angry soulful cloud nine by the temptation , on through the mournful abraham , martin , and john by dion , this cd will place you in the midst of vietnam protest , and dismay over the death of bobby kennedy and martin luther king jr. but even in the uneasy social climate of 1968 , respite wa found in music . there is the sunny feathery beautiful morning by the rascal , the bubble gum hit valerie by the monkees , and the gorgeous slow-dance soul ballad lalah mean i love you by the delfonics . this cd focus on the hit , so if you are looking to delve deeper into the music of 1968 , look elsewhere . but it is an essential cd for anyone who wish to build a thorough music collection from the 1960s .
0	although a nice album musically , these mp3 track i downloaded were of poor quality , probably recorded from an old vinyl record . all track had click and pop , while some had actual hiss and skip ! i know there are better quality album out there because i have one of them .
0	thought the song would pick up but it doe not - we were looking for something a little more dramatic but it is kind of bland .
0	i thought karaoke lyric came with the music . i would buy more if i knew the lyric came with it a in other karoake music
1	this is my pick if you need a song to get you started on a long road trip to fight vampire , demon and werewolf .
1	beautiful . thank you !
1	this is some great playing here . the tone and rhythm are perfect . this is excellent to study along with the actual 32 etude . i am giving it a 4 star because i do not like how he interprets some of the music . i know this music is difficult and there are many way to interpret it . however , some part just have to sound right
1	this is a great album no doubt . the call of ktulu is musically one of the best metal song i have ever heard . fade to black is an absolute classic . maybe missing a little ball though in this one .
0	bought this for a client
1	got ta love it !
0	music is terrible to boot .
0	i do not know what this album is going to sound like for katy perry ! , but i know for sure i am not going to hear the rest of katy ! quit writing song about split and divorce with russell brand ! get on with life and write some better tune . roar and walking on air is definitely keeper ! if you do not improve i will not buy one more thing from you ! sorry sweetheart ! lady gaga # 1 ! so there ! slut !
0	this product did not download properly . a a result i had to download a second time - incurring a second charge ! i wa robbed !
1	love it !
0	the jewel case wa badly damaged in shipment , and i despaired of having a flawless product . the cd came through in perfect condition however . i have used the cassette version of this product for many year to keep me on pace during my walk . when i played the cd , i noticed that the producer have considerably increased the pace of many of the selection , so i will not be able to use it any longer for my walk . unfortunately , i had to open the package in order to determine this , so i am out of luck a far a returning it is concerned ! too bad they did not leave a great product a it wa . sadly , it is not going to be my favorite any more .
1	love it !
0	im a big cornell fan but this is total garbage and an insult to cornell , soundgarden , audioslave , and totg fan everywhere . this should be a justin timbercrap song .
1	love it
1	great song about god
0	this cd is heavy duty sad . if you are a heroin addict , this cd may cheer you up . i only liked one song on the cd and i am a lucinda fan . this is not a feel-good cd .
0	it is an okay song , but the whole reason i downloaded it , wa i wa looking for a kelli glover song . maybe she is in the background , but not worth the $ .99 . sorry folk . i wish kelli would put up a website and let u download some song of hers . she can sing .
0	i do not know where else to complain about this but every time this song come on , i cringe and die a little inside . it is got to be the most annoying song playing today and one of the most annoying song of all time . aside from the fact that the song consists of 4 line of lyric with no substance , they borrow the can-can song and make it even more irritating .
1	critic have called this the best soul album ever . they are right . this is the best non-greatest hit soul album one can buy . outstanding singing , precision producing make this a can not miss album . the album look like a greatest hit package with ghetto child , one of a kind love affair , how could i let you get away , i will be around and others . the first track , just can not get you out of my mind get you going and you will not be able to turn it off .
1	beautiful , male you cry
0	it is advertised a the explicit version , it is not
1	cabaret still shine well after decade . in her day , nobody could deliver like liza and cabaret illustrates why . you have to hear it again to understand .
1	i have not heard anything of his since the crossover that i did not like . i can listen to him all day .
0	racist
1	one of my favorite song
0	this is my favorite cd however , the vinyl arrived scratched and i have yet to be able to actually play it without it skipping through most the song . i wa extremely disappointed .
0	bad , eddy voice is shot .
0	i heard this song in my church and the band wa great . it wa soooooo much better at my church than this slow jamz soul version .
0	honest face by liam finn and eliza jane sounded like an honest attempt to portray the shadowy side of human behavior . however , the instrument had so much of a screechy sound and the song wa just too depressing ( about a person who is scandalous but ha an attractive and innocent face ) . i accidently got stuck with this song when i wa attempting to download the amazon mp3 feature for another musical track . honest face is more for those who can look past the screeching sound and listen to an indie rock anthem for womanizer and maneaters .
1	the grandkids love it . thanks !
1	loving this song so much
1	a few of the song are out of show order , but glad to see they put all the big song on it this season . wish a cd version wa offered , though .
1	i love how her music let you create your own imaginative scenario or remember special thing . sometimes no word are necessary and her music allows you to go to a quiet place and not be distracted by lyric and allows you to be with your own thought .
1	thanks for getting it to me on time and a described . got ta love doing this dance !
1	i like this song a i know it wa meant for his father tug mcgraw . it is a great song and tim doe a good job singing it but i am not a fan of tims .
0	almost no metal behind this cd .
0	given guitarist emil perry thielhelm wa still a member of the band ( the only original holdover at this point ) , i guess this outfit had every right to bill themselves a the blue magoos . that said , like the predecessor set ( 1969s never going back to georgia ) , anyone expecting to hear a set of garage and psych-influenced number wa going to be in for a rude awakening when they slapped 1970s gulf coast bound on their turntable . working with original blue magoos producer bob wyld , these six track featured most of the line up found on the first abc album . added to the lineup this time out were sax player alfred elli and bassist cooker loprestit replacing roger eaton and second drummer jim payne . a a result the collection featured the same general sound a the earlier lp , leading to speculation at least some of these track were recorded during the earlier session and left off that album because they were longer and le commercial . regardless of their history , i have always been a big blue magoos fan , but their final two album have always reminded me of the way the rascal got away from their creative strength . like that other band , this collection found thielhelm and company throwing their artistic career at the foot of a strange mixture of jazz and soul influence . with three percussionist in the mix , track like slow down sundown , can not get enough of you , and the instrumental magoos blue were simply buried in layer of latin-flavored percussion and soul-jazz ramblings leading much of the collection to suffer from dreaded sounds-the-same disease . the combination of latin percussion and pseudo-jazzy move ( flatulent horn and aimless vibe ) , may have sounded good on paper , but i dare anyone to try sitting through the 12 minute can not get enough of you . simply horrible . adding to their problem , neither ka ( shown a kaz on the writing credit ) , nor theilhelm had a particularly good voice . they may have sounded okay in a live setting , but in the studio the result proved harsh and irritating to the point where the instrumental break provided some of the album highlight . - propelled by alfred elli on sax , the title track found the band taking a stab at a blue number . in the positive column , this wa the album shortest and most focused performance . in the negative column , the song wa a mess . sporting a forgettable melody , crappy vocal , and an overabundance of mindless latin percussion , elli endless sax solo just made thing worse . rating : * star - slow down sundown could have actually been a pretty good performance . the song had kind of a nifty adult contemporary groove , but the harsh , strained lead vocal , the jazzy touch ( discordance sax solo ( apparently meant to sound like jungle animal ) , vibe and heavy percussion ) ultimately killed it . okay , the fart sound at the end of the song always make me smile . rating : * star - and then there wa the 12 plus minute epic can not get enough of you . the song actually started out sounding pretty good - nice , funky groove and some tasty thielman fuzz guitar . and then thing turned horribly wrong . hideous group vocal ( i think kaz had the lead on this one ) , a meandering melody , and endless and pointless solo . imagine a crappy song out of the lee oskar and war catalog and you will know what this one sounded like . rating : * star - penned by newcomer elli , the instrumental magoos blue showcased an okay adult contemporary jazz vibe ( think about mid-1990s elevator music and you will get a feel for this one ) . technically it wa quite impressive with lot of space for individual solo , but it wa also sort of soulless . rating : * star - tonight the sky about to cry wa a bland , vocally painful , and instantly forgettable ballad . rating : * star - the lone group composition , the instrumental sea breeze express wa best describe a a meandering piece of jazz-rock fusion . their are some folk that go bonkers for this kind of free form stuff , but to my ear it is basically noise . rating : * star the album wa also tapped for a single ( their last 45 ) : - 1970s gulf coast bound b/w sea breeze express ( abc catalog 11238 ) sporting one of the year ugliest cover ( blame designer ron lieberman ) certainly did not help sale . all told , a sad footnote to their recording legacy . gulf coast bound track listing : ( side 1 ) 1 . ) gulf coast bound ( eric kaz - emil thielhelm ) - 3:51 2 . ) slow down sundown ( eric kaz - j. andreolli - emil thielhelm ) - 6:09 3 . ) can not get enough of you ( eric kaz ) - 12:21 ( side 2 ) 1 . ) magoos blue ( instrumental ) ( alfred elli ) - 7:54 2 . ) tonight the sky about to cry ( eric kaz - j. andreolli ) - 5:14 3 . ) sea breeze express ( instrumental ) ( eric kaz - j. andreolli - emil thielhelm - alfred elli - richie dickon - jim payne - john liello - j. lopresti - 4:13 for anyone interested , the blue magoos are still active and have a web presence at : [ . ]
1	i really like the song , but it wa the toyota commercial she wa in , with the song , that had me . this is the first kelly clarkson song i have bought . look forward to trying more of her style of music . she doe sing the national anthem very well too . thanks !
0	sound quality is so low . you have to turn the volume up almost to peak to hear it . it is a nice song though .
0	not good
0	a musical artist mega immortal heavyweight can do anything they want . but i hate it when they try to join the bing crosby holiday hit parade . at least elvis wa able to produce some brilliance in this area , like blue christmas . this is tweedily dumb .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	ala this wa not the original recording . nostalgia aint what it used to be .
0	in general i dislike live recording , for two reason . in an actual concert , audience are often ill-behaved and unforeseeable issue always come into play that affect the performance of the day . no artist should ever be nailed down to an interpretation made under circumstance over which he or she had only partial control - a if that wa the artist last word on the music . this is grossly unfair , and review rarely acknowledge the difference , but treat live and studio recording even a rival for a vision of a work . let me put it this way : if i audition a work and read the score , i can be annoyed and distracted by traffic noise , dog barking and child screaming if they impinge on my hearing , and it is no different with all the extraneous noise that a live performance may enshrine . so my purpose is defeated . it is a different matter if i wish to be an indirect witness at a unique occasion , an opera performance which i have to miss out and can view or hear in my home , when indeed i would fully expect to put with anything for that period of time . exceptio probat regulam ! it can happen that a performance captured in a live session is free of all these chance and disturbance . call it lucky , if you will , but such recording exist . the album under review is one such . moreover it competes head on with another recording of the same force made in the studio , and it come off the better . schubert no . 9 ( or 7 or 8 , depending on which momentary academic fashion is in force ) wa recorded by davis in the context of a complete schubert issue . it ha several defect : ( 1 ) the sound is boxy and dull , painting an overall grey over the sound made by this otherwise magnificent orchestra . ( 2 ) davis play all the repeat in every movement . for a studio reading , this is idiotic , since it make all the movement much longer than their natural content would warrant , without adding anything other than the same music again . ( 3 ) the performance is routine all the way through , davis having one of his most uninspired day . all 3 point conduce to an unutterably boring account , saved only by the splendid playing of the orchestra . another time , h & auml ; nsslers engineer were on hand to open the mike during a live performance . on that day , davis produced something entirely different . he wa alive and alert , judged tempo judiciously and ( i suspect ) played to the audience instead of the microphone . moreover he cut the repeat down and suddenly the whole architecture of the work make sense . event played out inside of the work acquire deeper meaning because climax are not repeated , but make their point in the unfolding of the drama once and for all ( mvmts 1 , 4 ) , melody are not trundled along mindlessly a dozen time ( mvmts 3 , 4 ) , and most importantly the vivacity of most of mvmts 1 and 4 is not sacrificed to academic criterion , but to a situation of living music making . even the sound is an improvement on the studio recording . the question remains in the end where to place these recording . but i think i have answered that question implicitly . the studio recording might be located in an arbitrary place near all the other indifferently conceived , but well played recording - e.g . in the vicinity of muti , karajan , ormandy , steinberg ( boston ) et al . the live recording move up a considerable number of slot . it is not top class , a defined by the classic recording of krips , b & ouml ; hm and wand ( berlin ) , but in the company of otherwise excellent issue such a blomstedt ( dresden ) , bernstein ( concertgebouw ) , giulini ( chicago ) , tennstedt and solti . an honourable place , even if the last ounce of conviction is lacking . ( p the album you are contemplating at the moment is the studio recording ) .
1	it is prince ! plain and simply a legend ! # rip
1	if you have watched the tv show , then you already know how catchy the song are . the only difference between tv and the cd , is probably length . i have not actually verified this , but it seems some of the song on the cd are longer , and due to time constraint they shortened them on the show ? either way , a good time with good music .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 2 other cd this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	such a great tune and could listen to it all day . blake clean version is just a good . make all redneck proud .
0	this is not mine !
0	far too sappy . vastly overproduced . where is the rawness and fire of the earlier day ? a tremendous dissapointment . the only good thing about it is i do not own it . a friend let me listen to it after i let him borrow some widespread panic . boy did i ever get the short end .
0	. but this is a poorly produced cd . both the computer-enhanced chorus that overwhelms the solo , and the overuse of vibrato in the solo make this a definite disappointment .
1	love every aspect of this ! great film ! great soundtrack ! top notch stuff . if you have not seen or heard this , your missing out !
1	love this music . voice are amazing . beautiful in every way . loved it from the very first time i heatd it .
0	hello e.c . fan , just want to let fan know that this is not the full set . it is still missing the encore played that evening with nick lowe ! if they are going to re-release this yet again , it would have been nice to finally have the whole gig . just wanted to let people know , for an archive release that is a pretty shabby thing to do . besides the fact , that the encore are really fun and feature some rare tune . hey maybe for the super deluxe release next time . : )
1	barb still ha it
1	just a great love song
0	didnt order
0	i bought this for my brother , and wa dumb enough to listen to it before i gave it too him . i have heard a thousand country song that say the same thing , just with different word . somebody stole my truck , some guy ran off with my girlfriend , somebody shot my dog , and i am too drunk to do anything about any of it . do not waste your time and money . just go listen to some 50 year old country music and speed up the beat a little . you will get the same result . tear in your beer .
0	so . now you do not pay to download an actual file , you pay to listen to one song at a time in yet another music playing app ? i already pay for spotify , i only wanted an mp3 to make into a ringtone . this is 100 % useless to me .
1	what else can i say ? another great album by a great artist . like another review it different than his last album but just a good all the same . i highly recommend this album .
1	i listen to this cd every day . all day . i absolutely love this group . i get inspired and motivated . feel good music by a family-group that can really sing !
0	loved his songwriting his voice real strong excellent country music highly recommend this alum have recently bought two more album of his from amz
1	good music throughout . always favor original song . mix up tempos/styles- appeal to all age . she is a really good singer . glad to see her doing so well and overcoming a rough time with positive forward sailing .
1	i discovered amazon cloud and the first piece i downloaded wa der teufel and the sound fill the room . i recommend the cloud and the schubert for .89 , how can you go wrong .
0	crap for idiot
1	bought this one when it wa new . a great double album of a neglected band . just listen to budd johnson for a start . the great drummer alvin burroughs , shorty baker and the young mr. b , are also on hand . grab it quickly .
1	i love the new cd .
0	this album is horrible . the rest of van halen are doing a terrific job , but david lee roth should be put out to pasture . i can not believe they would put their name on such a crappy performance . problem : 1. david lee roth think he is david lee roth circa 1978. a such , he feel free to take liberty and sing the song incorrectly . 2. he only sings half of the lyric , the rest are spoken . 3. he add all kind of lame embellishment to the lyric . 4. he change up the tempo of the lyric by coming in late and finishing quickly ( i.e . not singing ) . 5. he say a lot of stupid stuff to the audience during the song that are just awkward . 6. he us completely different lyric when a song break down quiet- think hot for teacher , panama , mean streats , etc . 7. while they made him sound good in the studio , david voice live is not good at all , he can barely sing . 8. if you saw them perform panama on jimmy kimmel right before this album wa released , you will know what i am talking about . that wa the most horrible rendition of panama that i have ever heard . 9. he flubbs the lyric on beautiful girl and even say right before the next verse : i will sing it for you right this time . in other word , dave ruined almost every song except for woman in love and i will wait which are the main reason i bought the album . horrible , horrible , and horrible . what they should do is ditch dave and go on tour with the lead singer of atomic punks- at least he doe a perfect rendition of david lee roth in his prime . do not buy this album unless you love disappointment .
0	just not what i expected .
0	i am not normally a fan of remixes , and in this case there is no exception . if you have not bought the original onerepublic album ( dreaming out loud ) that ha this song on it , you are missing out . i understand timbaland helped onerepublic get started , but there is no reason for taking credit for someone el song . i feel that timbalands contribution to the sound/mix of the song could easily have been left out . i much prefer the original mix to this version .
1	chris tomlin never disappoints , his worshipful heart is evident in this album . his music touch every generation , my grandchild , my child and i , all find something to like in burning light .
0	i would rather insert a sea urchin into my urethra than listen to this again
1	this is a wonderful soundtrack for a beautiful and thoughtful show . highly recommended that you see the show . currently playing in lahaina , maui , hawaii .
0	barefootin wa on there , which is not the song we were after . we wanted let go baby , which wa supposed to the b side , but instead it wa mountain of love by harold something or another . it came from a series of collectible .
0	this is a bootleg release from dubious source . i have no idea why amazon even allows this to be listed , but do yourself a favor and save your money . there is no legitimate issue of this 2-fer . if you see this release , it is a bootleg .
1	great song from a great band that will no doubt turn out many more terrific song in the future . so far demon is my favorite song from this group .
0	bought this a a gift for a family member who love musical . the song title do not appear on screen when they are playing . very frustrating !
0	stupid song
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
1	obviously a classic !
1	al stewart did some good work , only a few song had airplay . peter white wa the guitarist . a must for any 70s-80s playlist .
0	i hate not having a portable mp # file . i either own the music or i do not ? i do not listen to these tune on my computer !
0	sum 41 ha always been a band i looked down upon , their cd chuck really anti-impressed me except for welcome to hell which is the only reason i would like it , and this album is very similar in that aspect . the only reason i would ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear nothing on my back which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually . at least close to punk . but besides that nothing really appeal to me , rhythm is an ok song but the rest sound the same pick up some rancid or nofx if you want punk . i do not suggest you buy it maybe just download nothing on my back .
0	this song becomes more and more depressing a time go along so i deleted it .
1	get hype
1	great album ! thank you !
0	this is not the the acapella , and it heavily distorted . amazon music fail -_-
1	i would ask people to purchase beyonce if they like this artist . music is an individual choice and should be treated a such .
0	this is not music , it a cry for help . oh my gosh this is awful . not worth 1 star .
1	best alternative/pop-rock album of the last time . best parallel project by matt berninger of the national , and brent knopf of menomena .
1	he is sings about the love he ha for jesus ! i have always loved his m music . i love this cd !
0	i listened to the sample of this recording and wa struck by how overwrought and melodramatic ms. crowe had made her interpretation . i personally can not see this a a song about histrionics but about reflection on love and loss . mr. cohen illustrates what it is to lose a love later in life after a long relationship , mr. buckleys interpretation is of a young man who ha lost the love of his life and will never love that way again . both of these recording are looking back from a place of acceptance and reflection . ms. voegele ha recorded a version which capture what it feel like to have just lost that love and the wound have not had time to scab over . like job she is not willing to accept that her suffering is just , nor is she willing to curse god and die .
0	the novelty wear off very quickly . a couple of listens and i wa done with it .
0	i can not figure out why this song wa so popular in the first place ? only thing i can tell you is stay away from this one . worst song in the 90 period .
0	i have been a dylan fan from way back . and , i am also a big sinatra fan . i write this review from that perspective . what ha happened to american culture , that a piece of unmitigated garbage like this cd is getting such praise from reviewer ? are we in such a time that the katy perry and justin biebers are our standard for excellence ? anyone who praise this cd necessarily ha an insufficient knowledge of sinatra , and how he did these song . and i am tired of performer who have no voice at all , getting by , because they are supposedly emoting . frankly , this cd is strictly emperor new clothes . to put it bluntly , it is awful , no matter what critic , with clearly a le than familiar knowledge of sinatra , are saying . and no , dylan doe not make these song his own . such rationalization for lousy singing ! . dylan ha taken some of sinatra best - i am a fool to want you , where are you ? why try to change me now ? and trivialized them . not recommended for dylan fan , and certainly not recommended for sinatra fan !
0	did not purchase this book either or whatever it is - did not purchase this one . can not rate it . sorry .
0	home for christmas . sound innocent enough . but you would be well advised to stay away from this home . it is a horrible place . you will be asking santa for some ear plug if you purchase this cd . alternately , you can buy it for people on your christmas list that you do not like or just plain hate . how bad is it ? some say that the cia used it to torture hardened terrorist suspect in guantanamo . it had them babbling like baby in minute . but if you are a fan of kenneth copeland , go ahead and buy it if you must . after all , the man ha a private jet and he is got ta pay for that jet fuel somehow !
0	not great
1	wont go wrong , and enjoyed every second of eric claptons music . other downloaded mp3 music lacked clarity . you will not regret getting/purchasing these music .
0	rip off , not the song it claim to be . it is someone speaking in another language .
1	i wanted more of their debut album and got it . oh , of course it is not just rehash , but it is more of -and improvement on- their excellent sound , voice , beat , lyric . loved it upon first listen .
0	be warned she went creative # pose # 7 # iscreative . i first had 4 star but went to two lol
1	you either get it or you do not . but if you do get it then you will love it . unique , spacey , cosmic , trippy , technical and melodic . overall it is a great solid album . recommended to fan of voivod , toxik , watchtower , rush , vector , atheist , cynic or any other technical/prog band
0	csn , deja vu , after the gold rush . these were the album that helped to define an era for some of u . csn never supassed that first album , either collectively or individually though they did have some good song on some album . neil young wa able to transcend the era , that is why he still is a vital recording artist . nostalgia make me sad . i do not need it .
0	i wish i could give this album le than a star . the charlatan of a husband begged for people to give good review on this garbage . snake oil salesman josh feuerstein is now pimping out his own wife in his never ending scheme to make money off of poor lost sheeple . josh will soon have his child do kid bop christian album for sure . if i were amazon or any other business i would block josh from all other future endeavor .
0	i managed to listen to this entire album without buying it . that wa one of the best thing i have done . let me say up front that i do not care a whit about ms. winehouses personal life . and i have no problem with odd voice ( or even weak voice when the music is right , ala eric clapton ) . here , i just do not see what all the fuss is about . the voice is pedestrian , the style is borrowed , the arrangement are second rate , the song are , in my view , incredibly boring , and the overall product quality is nil . i have a wide range of taste , from bob dylan to janis joplin to antonio carlos jobim to classical . i see or hear no reason to purchase ms. winehouses warblings because they just are not good enough . they are boring !
1	it is a great cd ! i enjoy every song . you need to be aware , though , that there are 3 song that would not be considered christmas song . they are amazing musician . good quality sound .
1	will put you in the mood !
1	this is one of the best various artist thing on the market . blur , frank black , cranberry , the posy , jellyfish and others-what is not to like ? the album is a solid collection of exclusive acoustic performance ( guitar mostly ) of a quality so good you will be amazed . too bad that , in the end , suede with my insatiable one just ruin the whole picture of otherwise acoustic masterpiece by great artist .
1	it sound great and the price wa right
1	i play this to help rock my baby to sleep and she must find it so calming because it work every time : )
0	poor sound quality .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
1	this is ep loosely based on love in different form . my favorite track on it is and then therell be a light . also feature crash , body , self-knowledge , dependence and corp d amour .
1	10 year is one of my favorite band . you can really tell they put a lot of effort into their work . while i still prefer autumn effect , this album is solid , but that is not surprising at all . i really do not think 10 year is capable of producing crap . their music and the vocal are just too good . : )
1	beautiful , meaningful song ! god speaks through this song and encourages those who listen .
0	i wa pretty disappointed with this album . i wa expecting to hear the energy and killer guitar work i would been seeing on her video . it just wasnt there for me . i will still play it but it will not be one of my favorite . my advice would be get a new producer .
1	this is a very good cd for the price . i bought this cd just for that one song that i did not have but wanted .
0	i bought this for my aunt because she remembered it from she wa a kid and she claim she is happy with it . i do not care for this type of grade school music
0	lost and alone
0	it kept me in shape reaching for the next tune button . the dodo have 2 song that i listened to all the way to the end , all the rest were just too pathetic .
0	did not have the intro music .
1	i do not know why this song wasnt a bigger hit . it ha always been one of my favorite . it is very evocative .
0	this song wa purchased my mistake by my son . i have never really been into it . i have to learn to lock my phone . lol
1	i have followed lea since she first appeared on glee . she ha a voice that so powerful . and i am happy to see her career continues to climb .
1	i love this song because it is really catchy and fun and ha cute lyric . david archuleta win again . : )
1	i love this song . anything featuring david byrne is going to be brilliant , never heard of this band/group before .
0	i wa watching a bowl game and saw a commercial for this and thought i wa watching snl . i had to listen to it later because it seemed so bad . it is horrible . next song will be blue solo cup . then motor oil . then oral-b toothbrush . this is the promotional song for the album . how bad are the other song ?
0	surely this is a joke ? this music is terrible . save your money folk , this is not worth 9 buck . nobody should be paying money for somebody youtube music
0	i must have been one of the unlucky one that got a flawed cd . it skip like crazy . also , the plastic cd case came apart when opening . needle to say it wasnt a stress-free experience .
1	his father is known a high caliber musician , and his son is confirming the line of great and amazing artistic work . great cd for music collection . r .
1	this album is definitely worth buying ! wonderful song from start to finish , no skipping necessary . amanda shire fiddling skill , creative lyric , and sweet voice will have you listening to this album on repeat .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna and kanye west , their song have honestly been more jaded than strong from the heart . but when i had heard they were going to make a song with paul mccartney , i thought this wa going to be a bigger crash and burn with their voice . only one for kanye wa absolutely awful , and not even worth the time and the effort in regard to the love of his daughter with kim kardashian . rihanna and kanye west collaboration with paul mccartney , four five second is absolutely very low for both of them . they have absolutely no chemistry with sir paul classic rhythm and classic songwriting . for rihanna , it is one of the worst song she ha came out with , and she need to really find her voice all over again , and for kanye , it is the most rogue thing he ha simply done , and lost his own voice at the same time . for rihanna fan , she need much stronger for her next work , and she wasted her own time with low gimmick . song : d
0	the worst of billy joel . he should stick to studio album and even retire . his voice is not holding up .
0	i picked up this cd after listening to some sample . very good , i enjoyed most every song , except carried by the wind . when i first heard it seemed disconcertingly familier , a if i would heard it before . i listened a few more time , and yes , i had heard it before . it is a reworked version of yannis on sacred ground from his if i could tell you album ! i listened to yannis version and farishs version most definitely copy from that song ! but not only that , farish also inserted the same clip of child laughing that amethystium us in their song avalon from their odonata album . what is up with that ? unless there is good explanation for this copying , the song carried by the wind ha ruined ryan farish for me .
1	sound clear and no disappointment in quality . i am very happy with it and love the song . go for it !
1	love it
1	mixing deathcore with coheed and cambria , periphery may just be the next big thing in the metal world . the world of screaming mixed with clean vocal ha become increasingly crowded over the past few year . the style that once saw band ostracized from the metal world for not being hard enough ha finally found a niche of it is own , albeit one that is being beaten into the ground by a lot of me toos . periphery brings enough fresh idea , along with a solid understanding of their root , to craft an album well worth owning . while certainly not for everyone , a the screaming can get pretty brutal , the quality is high from beginning to end . if you are into the deftones then periphery will be right at home in your collection .
1	when i first heard this song i thought for sure that it wa an old school throwback . robin thicke , pharrell and t.i . definitly hit the nail on the head with one . it reminded me of something you would hear from earth , wind and fire . i hope these three collaborate again .
1	it is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste summary : buy of simply find it on you tube
0	i tried numerous time and it would not play on my kindle . then when i heard it on my sister it turned out to be really short and end with an ad . not worth the dl
0	i got this because it supposed to be a classic but this book is so out dated it loses a lot of credibility . many of the example or story drag on waaaaaay to long .
1	this song is a true testimony for me , with god i do have the victory
0	dear sir or madam , i have had some difficulty in enjoying this cd . however , it must be good to use the right half of our brain , which is usually not used .
0	seriously another generic radio rock band that fall in the theory of a deaman my darkest day popevil buckcherry just straight up generic rock that sound like bon jovi meet nickelback that will be in roatation at rock station for the next 3 month then no one will remember who this band is seriously can we be a little more originally please !
0	wow . do not know what happened here . usually i have no problem with amazon downloads , but this one suck . not crisp . instead it is got a fuzzy , dull quality . doe terrible justice to this excellent tune .
0	there ha been an unfortunate trend in the music business a of recent , in which sound engineer over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder , but damaging the dynamic range . this ha become known to many a the dreaded loudness war . it ha plagued many remasters including nine inch nail 2010 remaster of pretty hate machine , and subsequent release of classic beatles record . the compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency . god forbid little joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his ipod ( a note here : the normalization function would do this just fine ) . unfortunately , this is damaging the overall quality of sound . the first time i had heard anything by tame impala wa on youtube , and i enjoyed it quite a bit . i purchased the cd after hearing the truly excellent music to walk home by , and wa pleasantly surprised . it came in a very nice shrink wrapped digipak case , with truly gorgeous album art . in a fold on the cover , you have the liner note which list the lyric . everything package wise is very good , and i must say again that the album art - at least for me - is one of the best that ha come in quite a while . but once i ripped it to my pc using eac , my ear had started to hurt after the sixth song . i decided to affirm my notion that the cd had been overly compressed , by going on the dynamic range database . to my dismay , i saw that lonerism ha indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression . before i end the review , i must state that this album , music wise , is absolutely fantastic . if not for the poor mastering , i would have easily given the product a 4.5. i can only hope that in the year to come , lonerism will get an actual remaster , so that the dynamic will remain intact on the retail release . feel free to disagree/ask me anything in the comment . edit : a of recent , i have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around . it is essentially the same mix without the volume level turned up to the point of over compression and distortion . drum in particular sound much better . buy the cd and/or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version . great album , problem solved ! the two star still stand though , a this is a product review of the cd and not the unmastered mix floating around out there .
0	the trail hear did not sound like a mix- i do not like downloading any mixes- i like original music- these were all for my prom birthday party in november . still will play the tune but not what i originally wanted .
0	this film exemplifies everything i dislike ( and try to avoid ) about hollywood production . terrible .
0	i love dt & i respect them for taking a chance but this album doe not work for me . i suspect that i would enjoy it more if i give it more time but i am just not interested in investing the time right now .
0	not what i expected . it is kind of dreary and depressing . i love iris but not this one .
0	i expected to get the song i heard on youtube , not this one with half of the lyric deleted . not what i wanted at all .
1	cute
0	i did not realize that zappa had more than one recorded version of peach en regalia . the version on hot rat merit 5 star . this version left me greatly dissapointed .
0	it is rare to hear a cd that is so perfectly awful a this . this is the kind of cd you give to your girlfriend just before you break up with her . this is the cd you give to the neighbor who continually let his dog use your back yard a a toilet . molly jean wa 19 when this wa recorded . it wa produced by a member of the volebeats , which enticed me to buy it . it is rare to hear a singer so dreadfully off pitch , occasionally flat , frequently sharp but only about 5 % of the time doe she actually come close to hitting a note , even when she writes the song . this music is like the first american idol show of the season where simon laugh at how bad you are and find funny insult . oxycontin denim whore is one of molly original song . not only is she a very poor singer ; she also is not much of a songwriter . she doe a cover of a song called needle in a haystack that i believe wa done by a motown band called the velvelettes . it ha a nice bass line , which is the nicest thing i can find to say about this cd . if you had a cat with their tail in the vacuum cleaner , you might get an idea of the sound . this is an independent release . molly jean ha made her cd . for reason now clear to me , very few have bought it . this is one to avoid at all cost unless you are of a perverse musical nature that delight in the banal . i have not found a cd this dreadful since ramblin jack eliotts & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/the-long-ride/dp/b00000jzau/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > the long ride < /a > ; and this is actually worse than that . molly jean is pretty young girl . i am sure she will find something she can do well . taxi !
0	this track doe not work ! played once and that wa it ! gave one star because i received a prompt refund . hope this help .
1	it doe not disappoint . at all . not even a little bit . i am beginning to believe that hozier can do no wrong . brilliant !
1	if your a fratellis fan like me you will love this album .
0	george carlin wa a man who wa talented in many different aspect . he wa creative and every time i listened to his other show , i laughed so hard i had to stop the recording before i choked . his unique way of looking at the world combined with his mastery of language made george carlin stand out from others in his field . this album is not creative nor funny . it is just hateful . mostly it is just ranting about how evil cop , fireman and snitch are , a well a fart and enema joke . go listen to something else from his career if you want amazing comedy , because you will not find it here .
1	love this song !
0	i am truly a j-hud fan and have waited for this cd forever . it wa a truly let down for me with a few exception if it is not love , my heart , i am his only woman , invisible and naturally spotlight best song on the cd ! i am shocked that this is what clive davis had in mind for her . even though kelly clarksons my december had one hit on it and davis told her to start over and she said no . i would rather jennifer to of done it her way then his . but i still love ya jenn hopefully better next time ! for now i will be listening to her solo off of the dreamgirls soundtrack simply because love you i do is more like stuff she should be doing .
0	this band is not original . they sound like everybody else . they are nothing new . i liked this band when they were called new found glory . brainwashed people . go listen to some real music , like refused or thursday .
1	wonderful contemporary arrangement by gary bonner of these wonderful old standby hymn !
0	this is a waste of money i got a cd with no book and no talk on cd they sell something new now which is the same old thing with new cover very disappointing sorry ed sueta
1	great cd
1	beautiful , haunting and take me back in time . ani williams is the best when it come to doing her version of egyptian music . her music just feel right
1	great tune .
0	this is radio friendly garbage these people giving this five star im not sure if they are real people or work for three door down
1	this is perfect rendition . i found this song because it wa written about in a book i wa reading and i wanted it . i had also heard it on the radio and wa looking for the perfect rendition and this is it .
1	product delivered a described . ship time wa expected .
0	i am a vocal man , so i have always admired christinas vocal but somewhere down the line she lost sight of fun music , why is it that everyone today is putting together album that you have to listen to a hundred time and say what the hell doe this song mean , during my era of music it wa pretty simple . journey . lovin , touchin , squeezin , pretty simple huh . def leppard . pour some sugar on me , no college class to figure out what any of those song were about ! and i guess it is a necessity to have explicit language on every album now .
1	a very soulful john anderson song . fantastic download . cloud is so nice for all my music . thanks amazon for providing such a great service and great selection of music .
1	great metal song
1	. then you will love this . if you enjoy autotunes and song about being an independant woman who married for status , then what are you doing here ?
0	3 of the song on the cd are scratched : - (
1	the majestic song dead or alive open this 1981 album on which cale is backed by sturgis nikides , jim goodwin , peter muny & robert medici . alone worth the price of the album , this song portrays the destructive nature of the pornographic underground and is driven by the shimmering trumpet line of john gatchell . a live version with a significantly different feel appears on & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/comes-alive/dp/b001ijz188/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > come alive < /a > . fighter pilot is another frenzied track where the bomberettes provide frisky background vocal whilst cales voice & viola rule on the multi-layered wilson joliet . eerie & gothic , street of laredo is a slow brooding piece with strange percussive sound effect that would not seem out-of-place in the work of edgar varese . equally downtempo , strange time in casablanca ha surrealistic lyric and a psychedelic texture . the highly experimental title track is a strange atonal affair dominated by the french chant of honi soit qui mal y pense , stab of high-pitched backing vocal and the weird wailing of dissonant synths & guitar . normality return with the mournful & melodious riverbank that reach a crescendo before fading out on enchanting instrumentation ; it recall the gentler side of & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/wrong-way-up/dp/b000002lnb/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > wrong way up < /a > , cales 1990 collaboration with brian eno . russian roulette rock hard in the & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/slow-dazzle/dp/b0013n47n4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > slow dazzle < /a > & nbsp ; manner and the album concludes with magic & lie , a striking blend of classical and rock that expires on the last gasp of shuddering drum pattern . honi soit is an uneven album and not amongst cales most accessible .
1	it wa what i wa after .
0	this is a very average song and cook scream in some place instead of singing . hard to believe that chris cornell wrote it .
1	i wa at these show . to have a physical piece of history that i wa apart of is priceless . y & t never fails to put on a phenomenal show . they sound a good today a when i saw them in 85 .
0	where is the banjo ? where is the awesome make me live music ? there is not one song on this album that compare to anything or any one song you have done in the past . whoevers encouraging you guy to change is terribly wrong . do what you love , not what other people want . this is definitely not what i expected . i just got this today , on your release day and could not skip through it fast enough . very disappointed .
1	a advertised .
1	i really wish they would do more cover . this turned into an amazing project for their fan . thank you shinedown !
0	a few day ago i bought the sister album festival , and loved every single song . based on that , i sampled all the song on this album to see if i should download it . after hearing these song , i definitely will not be purchasing this album . the girl are definitely beautiful , all right . it is easy to see why they are so well-loved because of it . but on this album , their voice have not matured enough to enjoy listening to , no matter how pretty they are . skip this album and move onto their later work , where they do not sing with little girl voice and their song selection is a little more mature .
1	nice song - i am not a big fan of old school country but this one not bad . a couple time in the song the lead vocal is a bit wobbly but she recovers well .
0	it sad to see him going down the same path a brad paisley and putting out this type of garbage . i can not not help but laugh at how bad this song is when i hear it . sound like something that an 18 year old should be singing not someone nearly 40. i try not to be that fan but his newer stuff doe not compare to his first 3 album .
1	i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio station coming out of chicago . when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which a far a im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever
1	always love to listen to waylon and jessi .
0	defective disc
1	it is pretty good . had it playing outside the front door halloween night . good mood maker .
1	adele ha a wonderful way of arranging and singing song . this one is a great example
1	i heard this gentleman sing on huckabee one night and i loved his voice . i immediately went to amazon to find the song and get it .
1	i have to admit that i know very little about the cover of a cover of a cover of a song genre , but in my opinion this is the best one since britney spear cover of madonna cover of marilyn monroe covering happy birthday for jfk . it is even above that silent night one that wa re-covered one hundred and eighty time by nashville artist alone ! i know how proud and happy glee must be to have become an integral link in the chain of this infinite artistic loop of admiring immense posterior through song .
1	this wa one of my favorite song from the 60 . i have been putting together a playlist of all my favorite 60 song and this one had to be included .
1	mint condition is an excellent group . they sing song that touch your heart and that you can let your parent or others listen to . the music is wholesome and meaningful .
0	too short
1	you will not be sorry , the song is enchanting- carefully moving from beginning to end , and taking u on a smooth ride through a sweet melody .
0	seriously ? no wonder black people laugh at u . i think it is time white people ( and all musician for that matter ) start bringing actual musician ( for the generation who may not know what that is , it is people with rhythm and who pick up these funny thing called instrument ) back into the recording studio . this synthesized stuff is too tacky for word . it give me elevator and walmart sense-memory . i do not even think this is good enough for a musak award .
1	this is spontaneously inspired piano music that evokes wonderful memory and stir up the dreamer in the listener ! the whole project , fingerpaintings : serenity is like peace on a disc !
1	except for a kiss a long a eternity , which is a lovely ballad that ha it share of vitas famous upper register , and is a very successful song , most of the track on this 2004 release tend to have a heavier beat and are great dance song , with vitas singing usually in a middle register . track 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 were co-written by vitas , track 8 , 10 and 11 written by him alone . total playing time is 36:15. i simply adore this cd . it is hard to imagine hearing it without being energized by it abundance of joy , enthusiasm and love . vitas music is a light that leaf no room for sadness and negativity . it is impossible to pick a favorite vitas cd , but this one hovers somewhere around the top for me . a warning must be said to be careful who you buy cd from . always chose a reputable seller with the highest rating ( a minimum of 98 % ) , a vitas , like many performer , especially those from distant land , is plagued with pirated disc . play list : 1 : a kiss a long a eternity . beautiful , melodic ballad . 2 : where is you , there is me . kuda ti , tuda ya ! get on your dancing shoe . 3 : do not keep silence so loudly . fabulous ! with some exotic techno sound . 4 : unlucky . a tune that will make you feel most fortunate and happy . 5 : half night half day . absolutely irresistible . 6 : heartbeat . try not dancing to this one . i dare you ! 7 : in short and a t shirt . keep those dancing shoe on ! 8 : mantra . nice techno flavor in this one . 9 : street of the capital . a cheerful , bouncy song , with a hint of that upper register . 10 : i believe in love . with sweet gentleness , this is all love . 11 : internet mood . no lyric in this one , just techno sound and the voice a instrument .
0	on this cd you will only find side a of the original album skin diver suite , side b is not included . too bad . plus : it is taken from vinyl , not from the mastertape . i guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip .
1	my 3.5 year old fell in love with this song when it came on our tv cable-channel music station . it is now a frequent player . he here is dozen of song a day , but this one wa a sticky one .
0	i wa really hoping for that sound they make . loved other album of theirs . but this one is different . it good . but i do not care for it . it wa a great buy .
1	lot of good song to listen to and put you in a very mellow mood . the only thing i did not like wa the volume on some low note of some of the song . it got so low at time i could not really make out the note . but i liked most of the song and the fact that earl had several guest playing with him on some song . all i have to do is dream is a duet with vince gill who even sings a little , the eagle hotel california ha jake shimabukuro on ukelele and blue moon is a duet with bill frisell . all well done . really enjoyed earl version of going out of my head and the old beatles song if i fell in love with you . very listenable and very relaxing .
0	i did not order this item and it appeared on my computer one day . some may like it , but i did not . thanks .
0	this version of the song doe not sound quite right to me . make sure you listen to it perhaps in itunes which ha a longer sample time to make sure it is the one you want .
1	what can i say , great song from my teenage year . now i have my teenager liking it . lol
0	i wa very excited for this album to come out . i have been a fan of river and the =w= since childhood . i am only on my first day of listening , but am in shock at the quality . big hype over this album and all it is is random , jammy song put into an album . plus i have heard half of these song in the past with the same quality or better . not too impressed . but i will always purchase weezer related album for support , but after the green album , make believe , and now this . i am a bit turned off . lover in the snow , blast off , & who you callin bitch are the only worthy song . again , i have heard these before this album . go buy the blue deluxe album . it is a way better buy !
1	top of my list . do you like to dance , to get your groove moving . elle king , where is she on the chart ? she should be ranking up there .
0	not the best song she ha done ! you got ta love the ministry to really enjoy this song . maybe there is more to come !
0	please do not waste your money on this recording . it sound a though it were input to the computer sequencer without any regard to tempo on continuity . a very un-musical album .
1	xawesomehave heard this song done a number of way this by far is one of the best
1	love dangelo and this song . this one of those song you can enjoy anywhere , sitting with your special someone thinking this is about u or sitting on the porch with a cool drink just enjoying it melody , doe not matter it just a great song . d angelos style of music is so refreshing because we hear so much crap on the radio now that hearing a truly talented person make just a beautiful laid back song that anyone from any generation can enjoy make me happy . five star from me .
1	love this song so much . reminds u to pray , give it to god , move on and trust ! great song of encouragement !
1	fun , upbeat song to put you in a good mood and make you want to dance .
0	i am not a fan of the vocal being redone . i liked the original much more . listen before you buy !
0	it a great song but the quality of the file is low . it not even 128bit . sound like it wa recorded on audio tape
1	i love these song !
1	excellent
0	i wa really excited to get this cd a i already had had a copy but lost it a long time ago and wanted to replace it . it arrived soon enough , however when i listened to it hardly any of the song listed on the back are actually on the cd . this is really disappointing . i do not know if it is a manufacturing error but it really a shame that they did not check it . the song are not a good a the original list on the disc and it is also very poor quality to have one track list on the cd and another on the cd cover . now i will have to look for it next time i go to mexico and will not be ordering it again .
1	the good morning song is what i bought this for , but love the cd a well . the good morning song can take a drabby day and put pep in your step , brighten your face a you sing along & dance with her . thank you mandisa for blessing u with your god given talent !
0	can not say that there is anything particularly memorable on this cd . i am a big van morrison fan but this is not my favortie album by far
0	boring
0	wa not aware that they were not the original track
1	first of all we have to clear one thing up . 0304 mean 2003-2004 this is her music for those year . although i am not absolutely sure if that is what it mean that is the best guess i can give you . another thing many people have said that jewel ha sold out . i understand their point of view . if you are a die-hard jewel fan and do not like dance , pop , or very upbeat music then this cd is not for you . i am a diehard jewel fan and love those kind music a well . so i wa very very pleased with this cd . this cd wa all about fun , experimentation , dancing , and just having a good time . so if you love any kind of dance music or pop or most of all a good time this cd is definitey for you . my overview of the track . 1. stand : one of my favorite . i love the lyric , the chorus is really catchy and the music is awesome . put together really well 5/5 2. run 2 u : i love this song . it is a sort of sweet love song . the lyric remind me a bit of older jewel . but the music and the overall song is so new and fresh . 5/5 3. intuition : everyone in the world ha got to know this song . love it . the french accordian and the urban sound together fit really well . love the lyric a well 4.5/5 4. leave the light on : woohoo . jazzy . i love jewel and jazz together it go well . remember the song i will not walk away . from her album this way . this reminds me of that only way way more upbeat . 4/5 5 . 2 find u : wow . great , great lyric . i am sure they will touch anyone who ha been in a rocky relationship and is trying to save it . really heart-felt verse and angst driven chorus . 4.5/5 6. fragile heart : at first i wasnt feeling this song and wa like err ick . but after a couple listens i wa really impressed . really cute and simple song . reminiscent of i am sensitive from piece of you 4.5/5 7. doin fine : another one of my favorite . love it ! it is just about being free , having fun , and takng chance . i love the beat how jewel sound . everything . great summer anthem . 5/5 8 . 2 become 1 : i am not to fond of this . my least favorite track on the album . i just think it is like every other love song . nothing really special . and not very catchy in my eye at least . 2/5 9. haunted : the absolute best song ever ! i love this song . it is so cool jewel sings from stalker point of view . it is creepy , raw , and emotional . she sound so awesome . almost rock and roll . totally different from rest of album . i love it ! 10/5 10. sweet temptation : good song . if light and dark can be represented altogether in one song this is it . awesome beat . good stuff ! 4.5/5 11. yes u can : great dance song . i love how she sings it not cheap to buy your dream . i am not suprised santana who she wrote this for rejected it . he is not cool enough to pull it off . go jewel ! 5/5 12. u + me= love : another awesome song . reminds me a bit of run 2 u. however the lyric are so much better . like a girl anthem . just listen . great beat a well . 5/5 13. america : great message . i love controversial jewel . even if this wa a she sad a bit of a watered down version . i would pay big buck to see what the record label cut . get a little repetitive but the awesome lyric save it . 4/5 14. becoming : good song . not my favorite though . it ha good lyric however . not very catchy though . 3/5 . well . and wow ! another great piece from jewel . she sound great , she herself love this album . same old jewel writing the mst awesome lyric . just different sound . she is doing her thing and you are going to love it . it is light and dark but catchy and upbeat . however like i said before if you are a fan of jewel at all and do not like pop/dance music . then skip it . although i do miss the old jewel a bit . that is what the older album are for . i appreciate her keen sense of evolution . i can not even wait to see what she put out there next . buy this ! buy this ! buy this ! you will not regret it !
0	love bernie worrells contribution but this should have never came out you think a track featuring garry shider , skeet curtis , and tyrone lampkin they would have made something funkier .
1	great cd and great series . i own all of them . steve boalt
1	beautiful music to enjoy
0	i guess the best way to describe my listening experience is by analogy . i think i wa spoiled on the old chicago . kind of like the 72/73 miami dolphin . i expected them to dominate for many year but wound up playing it safe year after year and never winning another super bowl . same here with chicago . 60 and 70 with their intense musical and political statement . and then 80 and 90 mega wimpy commercial hit . chicago is no longer relevant like they were in the 60 and 70 . such a shame ! it is also sad they sold out once again ! i thought they were inspired again after touring last couple year with earth wind and fire and that they wanted to do an album of significance . in many interview during their 15 year musical hiatus , robert lamm ha said that the band wa adamant about doing an album of relevance and that they would not be pigeonholed into a being ballad band . the band doe not seem very interested in their legacy . they are more concerned about funding their retirement year with this moldy drek . i also think that wea ( now and former label ) had creative control for this project . well . i am certain they will get some hit from this . 3 minute pop song for the ipod are the name of the game today . the song are marginal with a couple of exception like feel , 90 degree , already gone , better . if there wa no champlin , i would give it 0 star . since champlin wa coerced to do this cd , i give it 2 star for bill voice and songwriting talent . the rest of the guy need to think about the next record whether it is solo or chicago 31. ooops ! i will not hold my breath a this ha been rumoured to be their swan song . too bad !
1	i love this song . i sing it all day every dayyy !
0	do not care if it your birthday or not . the song is awful . she need to be banned from radio completely . hide your wallet so you can make her go away .
0	ok
1	another solid release ! this cd fit in well with the rest of the music ty ha put out over the year .
0	they used to be cool . every song on this album sound the same . this record could not be more boring , and redundant . they should drop an n , because there is no point in listening to it . it blow . do not buy this !
0	this cd contains the censored version . when cash say the son of bitch you will hear beeeeep instead . what are we , 10 year old ? the at san quentin original version is uncensored . i am not sure what other version are uncensored , but definitely this one is . when this song is not censored , it is a 5-star song that put a smile on your face .
0	it reminded me of jimi with an srv twist , wonderful .
1	some good music from the past that get only light current radio play ( i have not heard the knack since they burned brightly and faded just a quickly ) . and most of these will not get much play 30 year from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality song not heard much today .
0	i like the beat & the tune , but could do without the lyric . where al word crime ha similar beat & tune but happier , fun lyric .
1	ahhh ! that sweet voice of anne murray , this lady pours her heart in to all of her song , an extremely pleasing voice for your listening pleasure , buy it youll be glad you did .
0	0304 see jewel cross-over from her folk-country root to pop . laced with heavy beat and keyboard , this album fails to ignite and feel labored and intense . whereas , jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling , this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her . her beautiful voice get lost in production with only the moderately successful intuition making any mark on the listener . i love jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me . a disappointing affair overall . i think that she will look back on this one with regret .
0	well i see now it doe say this is a cd . but i am so dissatisfied . i thought richard would be stretching with me . he is not at all . i went to his website to let them know how upset i am the email came back undeliverable .
1	this is one of the best new band out there at the moment and this album and song are a must have !
1	love anything that elvis sings
1	johnny cash . enough said .
0	there are many release of the world of nat king cole ( others with 27 to 52 song ) which importantly include the brilliantly done unforgettable duet where natalie sings along with his original version . this is a chopped down version of the album with the same title and if you are going to spend your hard earned dollar , you are better off skipping this one for one of the others .
1	it more than met my expectation . barbra did it again .
0	the song is great the mp3 stink amazon ha it tagged so you have to use their player to get it to work . it is not a stand alone mp3 . i do not think i will be buying anymore mp3s from amazon .
1	if you are an adopted child who feel that empty space in your heart or someone who want to understand then listen to this song .
0	i like to pick out 3 song on an album that i would play on my fantasy aor radio program . i can not find 1 here . just when i think i like what i am hearing they find a way to blow the deal . almost every song is overplayed . talented guitar but little feel for restraint and focus which sends most song off the road . recalculating ! weak lyric and vocal and unfocused arrangement dominate the cd . they can surely play but need some serious direction . will jennings greatest advice for peter wolf wa to keep it simple stupid . these guy could use his help , and get a singer . could end up being somebody .
0	do not appreciate any nudity openly on amazon
0	would it kill amazon to get the original version of this song ? this remix is pure dreck , avoid like the plague .
0	started out very slow , just could not feel it !
1	from one of my favorite movie , this song can bring out so much emotion and feeling . love love love it .
1	sarah mclachlan ha such a beautiful voice . make it sound a if an angel is singing the song . one of many tremendous song released by sarah mclachlan .
0	i received a discount on this product for my honest feedback . good item
0	there is a reason this recording is dirt cheap - it is a live recording with somebody coughing all through it . you would think they would have chosen a better performance to try to sell .
1	brilliant ! i have not seen the show ( hope to , some day ) but the music alone is phenomenonal !
1	very sexy cool
1	one of the best compilation ; a great way to meet and learn about yes . when most people think of rock music , the general conception is that of boisterous , noisy , unruly dope . then group like yes , pink floyd and the who demonstrate a mix of genuine talent and sophistication . these tune are not only enjoyable , they also nurture one synphonic appreciation . thus rock and roll grew up to become plain rock , which evolved to the level of classical masterpiece .
0	it is terrible when fm radio play out a song that wa average to begin with . it make it even more lackluster to the discerning listener
1	i do not think mozart purist would want a collection that consists in large part of excerpt or single movement from various work , but i bought this for my kid and it really is an entertaining , first-rate , diverse introduction to the endless repertoire of mozart . perfect for someone who is only a casual fan of classical music , or kid who need memorable tune to sustain their interest in classical music , or i suppose for someone who just want beautiful music in the background .
1	a good mix of common song from merry england ! - i particularly enjoyed the sound of a man from the 16th century bemoaning all of the progress and newfangled fashion that were destroying the heart of the england he knew .
0	this album is trash , this band completely copy and try to be gun n rose of the 1985-1989 era with the leather , boot and aviator . the lead singer of faster pussy in one video try to be axl in jungle with the hair sprayed up and bengal bracelet and leather pant . dont buy this imposter junk , go get appetite for destruction by gnr and rock out . no one can ever be axl . the song try frail out too due to the rhythem guitar [ being bad ] . also the lyric try to be like brett michael of poison and [ are awful ] . rock on
1	i have also been waiting for this cd for about 3 year now , and now that it is finally out . the anticipation is deffinatly worth it . i love this cd , it is just a amazing a i had expected . it is awsome . it is good no matter what type of music you usually listen to . it is a combinaiton or hip hop , and metal . it is an awsome combination . it is funny , adn serious . so nomatter wht your mood is you will enjoy it . i think that this cd ha just made my month . i got it the day it came out , and wouldnt have it any other way . go pick it up ! now !
0	used a directed and noticed no change in behavor , my food shopping did not change , eating did not change . but will keep using to see if there will be any change .
1	beautiful ! song .
1	it is not the original version , but he get close to it . i had heard this song back in 1993 and wa very moved by the lyric . i inquired at several record store and could never find out who song it . i finally wa able to google it ( 2010 ) and found the exact song by eddy grant . the song speaks about the political and ethnic treatment of people of color . great song and powerful message , a must listen for the cultural sensitive person .
1	this is ideal music for easy listening . it play well a background , or for intent listening . eleanor mccain ha a beautiful voice that she employ well . her song are well-chosen & have depth & meaning . fortunately , she doe not try to showcase her entire range in each song , like some other talented singer such a celine dion , whitney houston & mariah carey . this make eleanor far more pallitable for extended listening . she outshines almost all other female vocalist . her cd are hard to find , so if you see one , buy it . you will not regret it ! i would love to see more from this artist , including original work !
0	i noticed seventy seven people also did not order this and it showed up in their order . not a way to promote a band .
0	the file i downloaded wa corrupted . the amazon downloader would not allow a second try . i asked for and received a refund .
1	love it , best vocal on history , oh my gosh , unbelievable .
0	i really wanted to like this album a i bought it the first day it came out . i bought it . and also got two bonus track butterfly and christmas song ( for a total of 18 ) on this version . i am very sorry to say that india sophomore effort is jinxed . i have listened to it carefully about five time and nothing really stand out . the track become monotonous because the production is weak and the lyric are extraordinarily sappy and preachy . the best song india ha done aside from her first album is butterfly . this song stood out on the red star sound compilation album . sadly , this song is rehashed on this album but this version completely destroyed the beauty of the original . instead of a strong , punctuating beat to accompany some good lyric from the original , the new version slows to a crawl and never build the momentum of the original . the christmas song with stevie wonder is nothing more than filler . india message just do not resonate with me on this album . she actually seemed more mature and realistic on her first album , while this album is very idealistic and overly positive . hopefully she will make more classic like brown skin , back to the middle , video , and nature in the future .
0	it is a typical contemporary song . it make a great high school reunion song . for me it is john mayer debut song . you will know what all this time wa for , indicates his confidence in his song .
0	received wrong cd !
0	not at all what i expected . kind of insipid .
1	i first heard this on pandora so i quickly looked it up on amazon and purchased it . this is a great acoustic version of iron bar by stephen marley !
1	it is a fantastic mp3 that i can blast into my ear via my mp3 player=what is not to love ? i love how easy it is to purchase great sounding mp3s through amazon .
1	this is the hottest song i believe i have ever heard . a must for those who collect this type music .
1	she is amazing singer and she is even better live . i wish i could find all of her song live !
1	i love barbra streisand . the duet are great . another gift from my daughter for christmas .
0	no one need evil
1	awesome cd
0	the instrumentation is amazing , the vocal are very good but when i first heard the lyric i just thought wtf . this ha got to be a joke . why waste such a good riff on such a lyrically poor song . i wa extremely let down . it still give me hope for the sound of this upcoming album . if the lyric were any better this would be one the most badass song ever .
1	my favorite recording of my favorite classical piece . played by the master himself . it long but worth it . everyone should hear it at least once .
1	this album is a must have for anyone looking to hear some very creative rock tune with a pop edge to it . with a very high level of musicianship , dale will take you anywhere from an experimental and psychedelic rock tune to some more modern acoustic folky song . amazing songwriting musically and lyrically !
1	cripple creek by harvey reid is sensational the thing he doe with a six string banjo make you want to get up and dance . keltic flavor to his music which only make it more appealing .
0	deleted
1	i would heard this song for a while on the radio and decided to purchase it . the price wa right so i bought it .
0	thought the artist were the original singer . they were community theatre caliber . ok , but off broadway . best song from the best musical , but not the best singer . come on man !
1	this song is truly inspiring . i first heard it during a worship session at a church i wa visiting . i quickly found it on amazon .
1	david broza is an amazing talent . loved seeing him live and wa thrilled to purchase this cd .
0	i bought this for my grandparent who requested it . not my taste on music but it doe remind me of them .
1	i wa too guilty to like this song . i mean , the beibs ? but once i learned that ed sheeran co-wrote it , i could live with myself . all is again right with the world .
0	disk skipped in place
1	i used to hear this song a lot on the radio the first year after it came out . it wa really good , but sadly airplay seemed to be almost nonexistent since then . i got this , because i had a $ 1 amazon mp3 credit awarded for a purchased cd . after skimming through a few other artist , i remembered this song and picked it up . the acoustic version is clearer and sound more energetic than the original , which is a noticeably good thing and i would recommend this track .
0	if you are looking for bruce with his acoustic guitar and no band , this cd is for you . it will remind you of tom goad , which i actually own but have not seen since the first and only time i played it . though , i have listened to springsteen for twenty year , i am not a fan of his pre dark side of town work . i never cared for dylan and i do not like any of springsteens solo work . if you like busa , etc , you will not like this cd . some of this material could have been interesting if they had been recorded a rock song . i gave the cd two star because it wa made by springsteen .
0	ok
0	i downloded this song to listen to new music , but it is not my preference . it is a very experimental music for my preference .
0	this wa a gift for a friend , i never listened to it , but she loved the music .
0	when i gave this album 3 star at one time ? ! after listening to az , then listening to this , a thought hit me in the head like a mike tyson punch , this album is a bad a it get . first off this guy bite off everything in his site ! the album title get rich or die tryin is a similar sound to az doe or die , just longer . the only reason why he is famus is because he got shot 9 time , and he is a fool on stereroids . he is all over the medium , and is an annoyment on mtv and bet ! anyway on the album , his lyric are childish , and nursery rhyme , along with a lame horrible flow , with good beat , but putting him on the track made em sound bad . he is a million mile away from being pac , and ja rule ha a good chance of beating him . if you like pop rap , odds are you brought it , and after reading this review , you hate me . but for those who like real hip hop , understand this is garbage , and is doe not even to deserve to be called a rapper from queen ( na , az , and , mobb deep hold true to the queensbridge name ) it is not even worth 50 cent itself . it doesnt even deserve to be on the shelf ! interesting fact : this fool dissin ja rule , yet he is copying jas style ! i mean he ha a fake gangsta image , and club song , love song , and he acually sings song , imitating ja rule . and also , he used pac rhyme on the hail mary remix from tupacs song hail mary , and against all odds , to dis ja while using tupacs rhyme for exploitation . what a joke , a discrace , and a cancer to hip-hop . ( just like chingy , juelz santana ( he ha good beat , but his rhyme are completly senseless , ludacris , g-unit , j-kwon , bow wow , and u know who else ) peace
0	100 % agree with other reviewer , these mp3s are censored and should be labeled a such
0	love cyndi lauper but it suck big time that my ipad 1 can not use this prime music which i am paying for
1	michael john poirier ha a soothing voice that match his sublime lyric . i love two song on this album especially : forgiven and the maiden and the messenger . forgiven is a beautiful duet between michael john and a young girl who ha an angelic voice . i actually may have been one of the first people to ever hear the maiden and the messenger . michael john played it for me in a chapel after he wrote it , asking what i thought of the song . i loved it the first time i heard it and have loved it ever since . the refrain is something that will stay with you always if you hear it . i still find myself singing that refrain in the back of my head . the album is worth it for just these two song . the art on the cover reflects the blood and water that flowed from the heart of christ- drawn by a mutual friend .
1	it is awesome ! so glad a cd came out .
1	great song . the live version i think is better an the album version . i do not think this song got played alot .
1	much better than i had hoped for ; the basic reason i purchased two additional cd of joes . can not go wrong here !
1	one of his best to date
1	i recently went on a tour of hearst castle in central california . there is a grand dining room where invited hollywood celebrity and others dined in the 1930s - 1950s . our tour guide told u that he liked tumbling tumbleweed so much that he would have the band in the grand dining room play this song , tumbling tumbleweed , over and over ! -
0	they do not pay me to lie / i am a wayne fan but not a fan of this album ? what happen
1	great music ! loved it ! thanks a lot !
0	lately it seems like rob zombie ha lost alot of his grit , this album sound a lot like a black sabbath album or something of that nature . i absolutely loved hellbilly delux , and sinister urge wa all right , but rob ha really gone downhill in my opinion . a lot of the track on here are boring and uninspired , let it all bleed out is all right , but i would take any track from hellbilly over it . bring back the old rob zombie !
1	took his course up at the conference center . amazing ! changed my life . increased my biblical understanding by 1000 % ! you simply can not go wrong with this . and dan ha been teaching this method to student of all type , culture , country , and language for generation . it work , and you will understand it . all material , not a lot of added unnecessary b.s . ( sorry ) . in other word the focus is the lesson , not dan ! if i could buy it for you , i would . if i could put it online for free , i would . but i can not . but it is le than $ 10 , so just get it .
1	it would be hard not to like this effort even if one were not a huge fan of jennis father geoff and an admired of her mother , maria . so . those question are answered . a for the cd and jenni on her own , this is a well thought out , highly listenable and original album . it ha been playing on my equipment for several year now , and wear well . enjoy .
0	i love the classic moonglows recording . so i wa delighted to see that i could purchase them on amazon and not have to take the time to digitize vinyl . oops - i downloaded i wa wrong and it wa completely not the original doo wop version of the song . this version ha a strong background track , it is highly produced , it is just off . this is just my taste , but the new version of the tune wa awful and not what i wa looking for at all . anyone interested in classic moonglows track should beware before buying these .
1	love love love !
0	too pop , baby sounding .
0	i did not appreciate his bit about joining isi .
0	god imagine dragon are a one hit wonder that have not gone away .
1	i purchased this album a part of a workshop we presented in my art fraternity , gamma xi phi . listening to it will help the listener to make the connection from the harlem renaissance through the black art movement to the modern era . ms. sanchez present a work that is smart , bold , witty , and deep . this wa my first time hearing her perform a opposed to reading her work in a book . a a gay person , i must admit i wa taken aback by some of the language in one of the poem , but i had to realize that this wa recorded during the black art movement , a different era and a different consciousness among the reigning black poet of the time . in spite of that language and those idea , this is a solid piece of work .
0	horrible . sings through his nose and steal all of his guitar lick from others . do not bother with this one .
0	i love these song but the quality of the album wa awful . every song clip horribly , especially demon . please release a better version .
1	just a great a their first !
0	while i love the cd , it would not play on our cd player for some reason . i tried it on my son player and it worked . the reason i wanted it wa so we could go to sleep listening to it . maybe it wa a problem with how it wa pressed ? i do not know . disappointed ! : (
1	a fun and lovely song to sing along to . i bought this version to play in the car for the little one . this is a classic must for child !
1	granddaughter love t
0	no heart , no feeling just strumming on his oud . i do not know what he wa improvising but it felt more like koord than hijaz
0	take some no-doze before you listen to this one .
1	i like these guy , they kind of blur the line between pop and rock but somehow still come off a being heavy . they just kind of have a nice old-school feel good rock vibe .
1	magic
1	love her and her music !
1	this came out in the 80 and wa a record of rerecordings of their hit . it is for completists like me . i think the new version are great ! but there is no cd for this one . i wish they would put out the rest of their early stuff . but this one will do if you want the band doing great version of their song . with mark l too .
0	bernie the buffoon is an even bigger joke than i thought . bahaaaaa !
0	i love this song i.accually searched for two week to find it then i had a brainstorm and used shazzam , and got it that way my 15 month old dance evrytime it come on . luv it .
1	i have seen it written that great art divide , and that is certainly the case with the astonishing based on fan review all over the interwebs . for me , this is something decidedly different for the band , yet unmistakably dream theater . the shift in focus from shredding to melody , long drawn out piece with little direction to tight well thought out piece is very refreshing . while it certainly a 5 star effort from the band , for my taste it a little samey . and i completely get why , a this ha been billed all along a a rock opera . for me , this may be a top 5 effort from them . it grows on me with each listen . strong 4 star rating from me .
0	cd no good , no refund
1	welcome back missy !
0	too expensive
0	her music is horrible and she support , endorses , and sleep with lilo brancato , a cop killer . if you buy or even listen to her crap then you are spitting on the grave of a brave nypd detective , daniel enchautegui and telling his lovely family and every active and retired law enforcement officer that you do not care and are not part of a civilized society .
1	no one play this song any better than conductor and violinist . andre rieu . i first saw him on public television and wa so appreciative of his playing and conduting style . he truly ha feeling in each note he play on his violin . i know you will enjoy his music !
1	this is a fantastic album layered with dynamic lyric , interesting production and musicianship . it blur the genre of electronica and rock and infuses it with a psychedelic intelligence . for fan of progressive , emotional and electronic music , this is album is for you . check adam . 01 at [ . ]
1	beautiful music
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
1	i just discovered rosi golan . o lucky me ! she sings song of the heart from her heart and doe so with a depth of feeling that is rare . such longing so beautifully expressed . innocent . she us the minor mode in a way that express this longing and this innocence perfectly . with rosi golan there is no cynicism and she understands that love is the solution to everything , that it must be real and true love , and that such love doe exist . all the song are wonderful but i especially recommend come around , think of me , and yesteryear if you want to be transported to a place in the heart of real love . thank you rosi
0	oops , bought by mistake . do not waste your money
1	i just really like this song .
1	manakin moon is a great song from the mostly-overlooked band waxing poetics , who were a regional favorite in the norfolk , virginia , area . it is a mellow and evocative song about a state of mind . highly recommended . wannabe singer , just try to learn the lyric on this one !
0	i just heard light on for the first time . my first thought wa oh no ! this can not be your first real single . so i played it again and again . and again . nothing changed . no chill of excitement . nothing ! i wa a huge fan of this guy on idol and i loved how creative and original he wa . he made every song he sang sound like a modern hit . only to get a run of the mill , very basic , cliche , almost 80ish sounding rock song . complete with screaming and barely hitting the highest note ? let u just hope the rest of the album is much better . it ha to be !
1	country continues to turn out song with lyric that other format just can not hope to approach . adkins baritone is a perfect fit for this amazing song , which is sung from the viewpoint of soldier who lost their life in various war . this is a poignant and important recording , and is heartily recommended for listener who still appreciate meaningful lyric .
1	this song sound great on my kindle and roku ! i am so glad that i purchased it ! it wa definitely a great find !
0	lee morgan , quit mastbaum tech in philly and went on the road , and then rethought his decision and enrolled at julliard for a year . when he completed that year he went back on the road and this album is one of his first recording after his schooling . the brilliance of his tone is there , but his idea have not yet been fully developed . plus , cliff jordan playing , the senior side man on this cut leaf a lot to be desired for a youngster to look up to . altogether , a a maiden voyage , this is just a mediocre record . lee wa to make his mark later . one saving grace of the recording is the expressive expoodent , written by bassist eddie higgins . otherwise , there is little to recommend here . two star
1	love slipknot new album , i am a huge fan aka maggot , highly recommend to all the maggot out there
1	this is a great song that effectively satirizes maudlin garbage like the christmas shoe . if your fed up with a steady stream of artificial christmas cheer , and need something different , this song might be good for you .
0	very disappointed . the song i really want it are not on here . but it is still a good cd . if i had known my song were not here i would not have purchased it .
0	sound quality is poor - probably original . it would be better if the track had been remastered . at least you get to hear the way the music sounded by the original band at the time they were produced .
1	i love this song . the melody and musicianship are great . i listen to this song when i lift weight and in the morning a i am getting ready for work .
1	i like this version of the song . it is very smooth and sweet . the harmony is gentle and it lyric are thoughtful .
0	ha that garage/grunge band sound . just one of 5000 plus holiday mp3s i have collected , and forgettable . nice cover though .
0	i am trying to award this zero star but am forced to give it one . careful - most of the review here are for the 1994 broadway revival - which give high mark . this mp3 recording is for the 2008/9 london revival . the london recording is dreadful - truly awful . carousel in a cockney accent and badly sung . give this one a miss . try any of the others you find here instead . in fact this is so badly misrepresented by amazon by using the wrong review i am going to ask for my money back . - amazon duly issued a refund within a day of my request and agreed the wrong review are linked to this album . they are working on correcting the link ! if you arrived here from the link on the broadway cast revival cd page - this is not the mp3 album you are looking for . at least on july 3rd 2010 .
0	the recording ha a very low volume . when mixing with other recording , song from this cd are recognizably low in volume , can hardly hear it . good song , bad volume on the cd . anyone know how to turn up the recording volume of mp3s ?
1	found this song looking for the perfect backdrop music for my mexican vacation folder on my personal website . it fit the bill perfectly a it is an excellent instrumental spanish guitar peace that doe not overwhelm the web browsing experience , but wa a delightful addition instead . i have since listened to some more from this artist , and liked most of them , but this particular song is my favorite .
1	fun music . make you feel lighthearted and free . and it wa free . music ha a mix of jazzy , to indie to rap .
1	i love this album ! it is my new favorite .
1	a ok
0	this is terribly , embarrassingly boring . i know that phil spector is not dead yet , but even he must be practicing spinning in his grave if he is been subjected to this rebel-biker jagoff bupkis . if you thought garbage wa garage , you just might possibly mistake the raveonettes latest stinker for an entire landfill . in either case , take my advice and head in the opposite direction . in & out of control is nothing more than disney music for the cutting set . the stuffed toy market most definitely also extends to the suicidal-fantasy demographic . cotton candy noose and jelly has-been . oh , i buried you today indeed .
0	unfortunately this album doe not contain all of the shanty which is a shame , since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since i am in the military and these are very similar to our cadence . since this album doe not contain all of them , here is the youtube video with 35 of the 36 shanty . [ . ]
0	probably the worst excuse i have heard for a musical . no actual music or story and the lyric are just juvenile at best . doe not give me much hope for the future of broadway if this is what people consider music or art .
1	good
1	possibly the best soundtrack ever to this genre and kind of movie . this soundtrack is a perfect example of how important music is to the overall feeling of a movie . nothing fancy . just simple organic fiddle and guitar along with tim mcintires great voice fit perfectly with the time period . a perfect example of how le can be far more effective .
0	love the cd but no booklet .
0	horrible annoying sound . i disliked this tremendously . i kept hoping the sound would change but wa just the same 10 second sound over and over .
0	it bother me that the name last in line is used here . i remember seeing an interview of the newest ( at the time ) leppard making devil horn and mocking his former bos . sure we are entitled to forgiveness , but it bother me ronnie went to his grave despising vc and here he is trying to reclaim a piece of former glory . after rjd ha passed no le . onto the music . the vocal are merely adequate and border on generic/nondescript and while some of the song are decent they never rise above his lack of range and fire . he reminds of a better contestant on american idol . vivian of coarse rock but i question the bland guitar amp sound , just doe not have any punch . everything else is just by the number . for a band that ha taken such an amazing album and title a it name sake they just do not even begin to break new ground , do nothing special with it , and just generally disappoints on every level ronnie excelled in . this time they called in vocalist andrew freeman , a guy who ha the vocal power to complete the original powerhouse sound of the dio band . what a joke .
1	this downloaded to amazon cloud player and i had to install the app . i do not want the app . i wanted to be able to play song thru the music player already installed on my ipad . if i am listening to music on my ipad i will not be able to listen to this song without switching to the amazon app . that would b a pain . i thought this wa going to download to my ipad with all my other music . i have not looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over . i honestly do not think u can . this is why i gave it a 4. the song is great !
1	they just do not make song like this anymore . very good song . recived in great condition .
0	wondering why i wa charged for a song that wa on amazon prime music . what happened to free ?
0	depression is what you will slip into when attempting to listen to this comedy album
0	great
1	a landmark album .
0	not what i expected . not my type of music but it wa free .
1	few band have given me more pleasure over the past 30 year than dokken . even without george , without jeff , and a weakened ( and at time embarrassing ) don , this band is still one-of-a-kind . no matter the lineup , dokken is still capable of delivering a little magic on every release . jon levin is incredible . never thought i would say this but i almost do not miss george . the ultimate complement a dokken fan can pay . levin is that good . the first and last 3 song on broken bone are up to the dokkens best standard and the 5 tune in the middle are all still totally enjoyable . don vox are not a strained a on lightning strike again - he seems to have found a register where he can still sound smooth . ( of course , mark boals in the background doe not hurt but cheating is allowed at this age ) keep it going , don - we are still out there .
1	excellent new music
0	there are a lot of four or five star review saying that if you can get over the drastic change in instrumentation , this album is just a good or better . what ? ! if metallica decided to drop the electric guitar and start playing the synthesizer and flute it would no longer be metallica . if a bluegrass band switched to trombone and tuba it would not be bluegrass . when u2 decided to go electronica on their pop album it sucked . that is what this is . they did not just slightly switch the sound of the instrument . they dropped the authentic , folk , real-sounding instrument ( keep in mind . i hate hipster ) , and went with what can only be described a a fake sounding electronic drum set , a synthesizer keyboard ? , and electric guitar without any unique pedal sound or anything . it sound like untalented drivel sadly coming from a band that ha proven that they are anything but untalented . doe the lead singer voice still sound unique and awesome ? yes . doe this album have a few ok melody ? yes . if this wa their first album would they ever have made it beyond their local bar scene ? absolutely not . you can defend this disappointing decision to completely change their signature sound all you want , but the fact is that we all loved their signature sound . they could have simply tweeked the sound here and there to get something new and cool , like u2 did from joshua tree to achtung baby . but like i said before , this is like going from joshua tree to pop . they should have learned from u2 .
0	this soundtrack wa downloaded on a whim , after i came across it while looking for another music title . i remember hearing other similar flowing water/creek soundtrack , and thought that this would be similar ; but wa disappointed . i thought that this recording seemed fake , a if made by a synthesizer ( or in a bathroom ) . the track also seemed to be a 10-12 second recording on a continuous loop . like you , i base my purchase decision on the experience of others . if you liked my review , or felt that it wa helpful to you , then please let me know by clicking yes below . i would also be happy to answer any question that you may have about this product . thanks ! my review are real , and typically based on week of actual product usage . my opinion are not copied from other review , and are from my own personal experience .
0	bob dylan should know better - he no longer ha a voice . moral of the story - do not get old and think you can still sing . this also applies to harry nilson , paul mccartney , etc .
0	uggg , another christmas cd from leann rime . you are watching the decline of what used to be a great country voice . it is sad to watch all her project fail and then she trot herself out for any publicity she can get for another christmas album . people put out christmas music when their career are failing . leann used to have a great voice and wa a likable talent . not anymore . i can not understand the word she is singing and the album is not very good . i used to be a big fan but she seems so unaware of what she ha done to her career lately . too bad . career over .
0	not my purchase
1	r kelly by far ha left the r & b wanta be in the dark . r kelly ha produced hit for some of the biggest name in the musinc industry . to come out with a album that totally switch up the game and provide relevance to what is needed in music today is completly mind blowing . this album is a classic and is a must for anyone who really want to hear ( music ) . again , go get it !
0	not what i wa looking for- i wanted a reading of the sanskrit , the word for word definition and the translation . the subject matter is beyond proase and the quality of the recording is well done and is best for a first time listening of this great literature , so the 3 star only express my disappointment in what wa lacking . also , i personally find the music distracting from the serious meditation this work requires . the sanskrit mantra , when they are present and accurately read , are music enough .
1	wow ! these guy just get better and better and they work together so very well beautiful irish sound sing on
1	this might be the best product big bad voodoo daddy ha ever released . every song is fantastic . in this cd they mixed new orleans style jazz with big band to create a fantastic set that , though it is clearly big bad voodoo daddy , give it a fresh sound . the lyric are creative and the instrumentals are wonderful . in addition , the duet it only took a kiss is gorgeous . i had vision of fred astaire and ginger rogers dancing during it .
1	this is my favorite mark knopfler song . i can not say it is typical , but it is soooo beautiful ! randy travis also recorded it , but i prefer mks version .
0	sound like he just woke up 2 second earlier . the voice is no american idol or american trash . it is worse . and a squeaky guitar string top the annoyance .
0	this wa a free download for amazon cloud . the voice were not very good . i could see the supposedly funny side but wa not impressed ! i got le than what free should be !
0	the music is well layed out and engineered extremely well but the lyric make me want to slap this guy for being a whining as . his voice bore the crap out of me .
1	enjoyed this album very much .
1	beautiful song by leonard cohen .
0	it wa a cassette useless .
1	how can your toe not tap to this one . mar knock it out of the stratosphere again .
1	great worship this song is everything
1	this is a lovely piece of music and very affordable at the price it is offered . i have no regret about this purchase .
0	i heard a lot of good thing about this album so i bought it only to become disappointed . many of the song seem forced and repetitive if other hit they have had . i have it an honest listen several time before actually returning it-for me , it wa that bad . about the only good thing i can say is that blink 182 ha an awesome drummer .
0	this song wa absolutely horrible ! it wa very distasteful and lacked structure . i do not recommend this song for anyone . in fact , if every cd nick lowe made exploded , i would not have a problem ! it is terrible . do not buy or get this song ! warning warning do not buy !
0	it skipped many time . i wa given a full refund .
0	the tune wa a repeat of past have fun teaching song and too advance for my 4/5 year old . i am able to a adjust most of three other song i have purchased . the other song like water cycle were great
1	i love this song and group ! it brings back memory of my youth . thanks for having this song for me to purchase .
0	on 12.29 , i am waiting out in the colorado cold until about 2 am to see if i could get jim heath ( the reverend horton heat ) signature on a poster . first , he said , do you have a pen ? i said i did , and pulled out a blue sharpie . he next said , is it blue ? i said it wa . he proceeded to tell me he doe not do blue pen , and boarded his luxury motorhome . please do not support jim heath . jimbo and scott churilla signed the poster without hesitation , and are good guy . jimbo even took the time to take a picture with u .
1	fan !
1	beautiful love song . beautiful voice . i became a johnny hartman fan a a result of hearing this song .
1	a beautiful song , a hymn of earlier day , and who better to do it than fernando ortega ? the one-star review really should not be included a it is not a review of a song ordered on purpose , but rather an accident on someone part . this song deserves 5 star .
0	so bad and not in a good way .
0	unfortunately i have to say that i hate this cd . she promised a come back to her earlier work , but she just mixed everything that it sound like a soundtrack for a low budget movie . i love the thalia that gave u amarillo azul , en la intimidad , love , saliva , sudor , sangre ; too bad she had to meet emilio estefan and then everything changed , she left her record label , sign up with emi and they changed her style to latina bombshell . every single efort from emi is wierd , i hate the fact that is always the same latinada sound , like en tu y yo , en la fiesta mando yo , la loca ( what a waste of song , for cry out loud ! ) . the only one that is good ( and the only reason i gave her 1 star is no me enseaste , that reminds of the cd mundo de cristal , but the rest if bad , really bad . besides , the fact that she hired estefano to work with her , i wa expecting a very new sound , very cool , taking in consideration that he made paulina rubio shine again with her 5 star paulina , but no , i guess the chemistry between thalia and estefano wa just not there . and also , i agree with the one who said that she need to wait to speak english fluently to do the crossover , that will save her some embarrasment .
1	sent to a friend and now they love to hear him sing also . hope he recovers from his operation . thanks
0	only a soulless piece of trash would support a band that justifies and support rape of a helpless innocent woman . and for good measure , their music suck !
1	k. 482 is the most visionary , musically-expressively complex , and difficult-to-bring-off of mozart piano concerto , a true concerto for wind instrument , piano and orchestra . fischer , a conductor , extract unusually well-balanced , articulate , expressive performance from this minor orchestra ( in itself a remarkable feat ) , while searching out virtually every pianistic nuance of this unique work . some might question whether this is mozart-styled performance ; no , but it should be . ( i am often an admirer of period performance ; but there is a difference between period and fundamentally eternal - forgive the old-fashioned rhetoric . ) this review is based on another company lp issue of the same 1954 performance . fischer unrecorded earlier performance of this concerto with furtwangler are legend ; now one can imagine why .
1	it help when thing on the mind and just encourages to let go and let god handle all the problem
0	ordered the wrong one but i listened it it too late to return for an exchange
0	this is frank sinatra singing this song , not bing crosby . it is still a good verison , it is just not bing crosby .
1	two icon making great music together .
0	i love the soundtrack to psycho . it is one of my favorite of all time , so you can imagine how delighted i wa to see this release wa available . i bought it a soon a i saw it and wa excited when it showed up on my doorstep . i put it on my turntable and wa horrified to hear how absolutely terrible the sound quality wa . it wa like someone had held a tape recorder up to an old tv and pulled the audio from a beat up vhs . i could not believe how dreadful it sounded . and absolute insult to bernard herman classic score . so , if you are like me and collect and enjoy listening to soundtrack on vinyl , do yourself a favor and do not make the same mistake i did .
1	ramsey lewis ha been a favorite of mine for a long time . if you like jazz buy this track and sit back and enjoy
1	even if you do not dance , you can not help but move to this music .
0	they chopped the song off ! the original song is 4:30. the edited song , which appears here , wa chopped off at around 3:33. huge disappointment . and it fade out during they part where they are actually singing .
0	for all the good music i heard in the first season i thought for sure it would be included on this first release like drip drop and a few others , but this wa just a lure and missed a lot of flare .
1	what a great song ! gwen stefani is an awesome lead singer . i have always been a fan ! this song never get old .
1	they keep getting better and better , every song is talking directly to me ! your side of the bed , listen to the word - amazing !
0	i am constantly amazed that today musical group have such little imagination that they have to cop the name of yesteryear band who have already earned their niche in the music world history . . and that they do it so very badly . band like the people , touch , white witch , armageddon , ( and the list go on and on ) were extraordinary one-of-a-kinds . and yet , modern band continue to take those name for themseles , then release inferior , common , boring music , and expect no one to notice the difference while they attempt to suck in $ on the name of others . pathetic !
0	i have been a fan of buffy and james marsters for year , but wa not thrilled with this at all . the music wa boring and not a exciting a his brief singing spot on buffy . i would pas on this one .
1	liked it when i wa a kid . cool .her version of michael jackson . almost exact . now i am blown by it . she ha such a way about her . no wonder prince and quincy jones and whitney houston and all the rest admire her talent .
1	a very strong set of song , both lyrically and melodically . and robin is in good voice throughout .
1	okay , i bought this for one one song . jesus savior , it s a great song and i love the message behind it . my family just sigh when i pull out my kindle and start to play the song on it . they know no matter the season that song will be played . haha
0	music did not download .
0	it would not download properly . cant hear it !
0	did not download . pissed
1	awesome brings back many memory of good time , i am a sucker for the oldie
0	there wa only one song . i wa ripped off . i felt cheated . amazon please let customer know how many song are on a cd !
1	a great song , i love it .
0	warped upon arrival and water mark all over . doe not play correctly and unable to return . do not recommend .
0	mary poppins soundtrack wa the best purchase i have made so far . i bought it for my granddaughter birthday because she love mary poppins . she can sing all the song in the soundtrack and i love hearing her
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	thank you
1	one of the best sweet romantic song of all-time i think , true love wait and true love never grows old or give up and grows sweeter over time
1	great mix !
1	worth it !
0	mac milliers getting lazy with his writing . hip hop is more then just refurring to every woman a a b * or a ho and making million and that is all this guy think it is about . it get redundant real fast .
0	this album suck . like the other 1 star reviewer wrote , it is all commercial radio garbage . it is so overproduced , it is hard to listen to . i have been listening to the band since the late 90 and if you want to hear good o.a.r . you have to see them live or buy their first live cd . if you like this album , you are probably a new o.a.r . fan , or maybe you started listening 2 or 3 album back . which is not a criticism , but for people who remember them when they first started , their change to this is definitely a shock . sorry , but it is what it is .
0	i owned the original music from i spy album done by hagen and this cut is not that cut ! this is a bluesy , brassy ala david rose stripper sounding , slow paced arrangement . some of you will like it . i am biased , however . the original use string for the main line ( this us brass ) and brass for the aside or counterpoint . it had a faster beat with a drummer who drove the tune and gave distinct accent . this aint that cut ! for those who relish soundtrack music this , to me , is like the hugo montenegro version ( arrangement ) of the man from uncle theme . i do not even like the lalo shiffren version of the man from uncle theme . i like jerry goldsmith original version . everything else is pale . the i spy album are available but at $ 22 that is out of my budget for nostalgia and there are no track listing and if i were to buy it , it would be for the original i spy theme and a track called the international set , which is a lovely accordion and string based song . this is spy track would be to me like the fishing hole song from andy griffith done with a kazzoo instead of hagen whistling .
0	i am sorry . i have not been able to listen to this all the way through twice . love come to life wa amazing . i suppose this may be a worship album , but it lack all of the dynamic variety of come to life , which ha had me in tear many time . i will be selling it .
0	i like to think internally .
1	this worship ( my season personally ) wa awesome .
1	here we have another prime example of dmb doing what they do best : live show . this show is special for quite a few reason , one being only one of a few band to play the historic wrigley field and this being their last show of the summer 2010 tour . this release is the 2nd night of a two-night run , if you were a member of the warehouse , you could have gotten both night . anyways , this show is incredible , for those who complained about the last release sound issue ( live in new york ) , this release sound amazing , and on a side note , i could not really hear any problem with the new york release , but i digress . the show start with an explosive you might die trying , a great way to start thing off . dave then slip in the always wonderful stay or leave and even bt the second song , you can tell this is a special night for the band and the fan . dave doe a partial good good time , a nice surprise for the fan that go straight into yet another incredible # 41 , and like every fan know , dave and the band always re-invent the song . there is so much energy in this show , it really feel like you are there in the crowd . after the incredible two step , dave surprise yet again with the beautiful christmas song and end the show with none other than the last stop . if you are a fan , just buy because you know it is good , if you are new , still buy it and see the magic that is dmb live . dave and the boy still prove that after 20 year , they have no sign of slowing down or stopping what they do best . and if you are lucky enough to catch the caravan this summer , i am sure itll be the concert of a lifetime !
0	i like to download the free song and album to find artist that are different within their genre . sister hazel is not one .
0	not so much . only one or two song i enjoy . too all over the place a far a music go .
0	yee haw , wen de music biziniss iz filled with kommy fashist amerikah hater like de dixy chiks and sistum uf a down . dese fokes dun come out and dun speke to u tru amerikans , the 20 % uf u dat are left . we do not nede yur bush-bashin you 70 % + uf amerkah , you dun just git out of amerkah and dun moov to kuba ! yee haw ! i dun tell yu wut , this musik iz a breth uf fresh air to all de bush bashers ! just dun git , ither you dun support a prezident ( only if he repubilikan of course ) or you dun leave ! unless the prezident iz a kommy fashist demokrat , than it is okay to bash him becuss hez demokrat ! yee haw ! jeezus approovs of dis war , why on de sermon on de mount he dun said blessed are de pecemakers , an inturpretashion of dat meant that blessed are those who dun start unnessessary war to fin out peeplez numberz so dat so few left hav no choise but be peceful ! fredtowntard out !
1	i bought this album because i like the god bless the child track . i have been a fan of joe augustine for several year . will buy more .
0	those that have followed grace and the noc , this is a disappointment . grace is much to talented a songwriter for this . this is an artist like picaso doing a paint by number . if you liked never going back v song with meaning like apology or big white gate , this is for you . gone are song with meaning , soul , truth , blue , replaced by techno . i ms the guitar riff between scott and benny . i miss a piano solo like star . i miss a rocker like ah mary or stop the bus . the influence of neil young , zep , steve miller , stone , and janis are replaced by pop singer . yes every artist ha the choice to pursue and grow . every fan ha the choice to buy . my prediction will be a nocturnals reunion in the near future . i waited week to post a review to give it a chance to grow . it ha not .
0	this is not the ep version . : (
1	excelent damn donna u did it again u came through with a very empowering and inspirational song without being cheesy or to religious something i needed at this point in my life thank you i love you a life long fan
1	beautiful music . perfect for the holiday season !
0	wow i wish they stop playing this garbage on the radio by now ! even for a 8 minute song ? this guy is just desperate to keep his career going . he need to look himself in a mirror cause the music flatout suck .
0	crap
0	it ok , not what i expected .
0	i buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different picture of the eight doctor . they should have name it dr. who and daleks calendar . almost all the picture are from the peter crushing movie or comic book-like picture . there is only one of tom baker and one of john petwee . this calendar should be only for major dr. who and dalek fan .
0	01-06- making memory of us.mp3 could not be imported . the selected file is not valid or is corrupted this is my error message so the file is no good to me . .
0	the bad news is that even though this album transported me back to 1986 , the music wa just a awful a i remembered it . serious hair metal , here . i listened to the whole album through prime music ( thanks , amazon ) and decided that even though this is getting glowing review , stryper just is not for everyone .
1	here is a frank sinatra single that for some reason i did not discover until a just a few year ago . ol blue eye recorded can i steal a lilttle love with the nelson riddle orchestra during his heyday at capitol record . released in january of 1957 the tune spent 19 week on the chart and peaked at # 15. the song appeared in the largely forgotten motion picture rock pretty baby starring sal mineo . this is a pretty good tune and i remain baffled why i had never heard it before . this is the original hit recording .
1	the title explains the song . it inspires a person to keep going and that they have value . keep it on !
1	fun song
1	while the use of something other than xylophone and toy piano in a few track took me back to dylan juda moment , i still recommend this wonderful series . my baby fell asleep within 20 minute of first firing it up , and hopefully ha planted some subliminal love for the pixy to share with me in the future . the stone one is good too . but mike , please remove the electric from monkey go to heaven , for u purist .
1	i did not grow up with this kind of music in the predominantly african american church that i grew up in but listening to it now make me wish i heard stuff like this earlier . beautiful lyric and it is all lifting up the name of jesus christ .
0	i am a huge stevie fan , and this one wa rather disappointing . i actually bought 2 of these , one for me , and one for a friend of mine . the friend listened to it first and said not the best work i have heard from her , but thanks for the cd ! so on a long road trip , i played mine . boo ! so disappointed . possible 2 song at best were steve quality , the rest were rather well , boring . sorry stevie . : (
1	this song ha just enough of a mix of pop and funk to sound very enjoyable for everyone who hears it . it is just simple and fun to listen to !
1	the 80 relived
0	my favrit josh groban ever . i play it every few day . wish he would do more showtunes and le opera
1	it is been a while since i have really listened to tegan and sara , but when in heard i could not be your friend i immediately had to buy the album . i am so glad i did because i had forgotten how much i loved them ! i love this album - it is a bit different than what their old stuff wa like , but it is still awesome !
1	great quality . super fast download !
0	this is one of my all time favorite song ~ i got a new phone and wanted this a my ring tone like i had on my android . i down loaded the song and attempted to listen to it and got nothing but static . it wa a waste of my time and money !
1	i enjoyed the music ; however , would prefer to be able to purchase a cd rather than just a download . would give five star if i could have purchased an actual cd .
1	this song wa written by todd rundgren . hall and oat are good but todd the best , i think he produced them along with patti smith ( here come the night ) and lot of other artist . most of their big hit were written by todd .
0	i bought this song on itunes trying to respecect the copyright law however the import processing is confusing and i still have no idea how to put this on my computer . i thiink the system should be more user friendly because if i can not figure it out normal folk that use this service everyday ( like my parent ) who are le computer savy also will not be ablle to figure out how to import this music to their computer .
1	this group , especially this album , ha ruined me . i literally can not listen to any other music for more than a couple song before playing babel from start to finish . these guy are in a league of their own . i am fairly certain i will never enjoy a group music more than i enjoy mumford & son .
1	this cd ha made it possible for me to breathe easily for the first time it year . kudos to mr fredricksen for bringing buteykos method to light !
1	love it
1	this is a very nice rendition of this song . many different version of this song but so far this is probably my favorite version .
1	great product great seller
0	usually when you see a cd of little known tune from the classic era of r & b , you are in for some rare treasure . this is not one of those kind of cd . the tune are almost to a one poorly recorded , poorly performed , and lacking in appealing hook . this is one collection of lost soul that should have stayed lost .
1	midwest rock band pay homage to long tradition of not-quite-live live album . high energy song punctuated by strong harmony . fun record if you like old school rock and are looking for something new .
1	i use to play this over & over again when i wa in college . i so loved this song .
0	nice
0	i do not understand , how serious yes fan can consider this fly from here to be a real yes album . step back to the real world , dude : this is nothing else than an album that could be better titled a drama , vol 2. . but this time , the performing band name is maybe . . hey , but . what can you really expect when there is no more jon anderson and rick ( or even his so-talented son adam ) wakeman , back in the full gang ? in addition , trevor horn ha buggles-ed the music once again . this fly from here , definitely , only ha the cover art ( another excellent work of the maestro roger dean ) of a yes album . the music , really performed by the band maybe . and zero star .
1	exellent
1	wy i like all the cd because she wa the best of the best a a wife and a mother .
0	not what i expected
0	i will start off by saying i like blink 182 and also alkaline trio . when i heard skiba joined the band i figured we would get a awesome mesh , we did not . i thought tom wa the problem with the band but it seems to be mark , very mediocre effort . there are two song that are very short and initially funny but after further listening are very lazy . i get that the album is named california but how many time do we need that forced down our throat . and you guy are too old to be singing about being teenager anymore , let u grow a little .
1	fantastic !
0	one song that is listenable but they changed from it is original composition . shame .
1	i love this song !
1	great song !
0	garbage . joe derosa is not a funny man .
0	why do artist forget what really made them famous in the first place . if your expecting to hear the violin and banjo like i wa you will be very disappointed . at time the electric and slide guitar completely drown out the singing . other time the music fade in and out like a record on a turntable that is starting to go bad . i did not want to hear another piece of pop garbage like their last album . i thought we were going to have something with a little more bluegrass or country flavor . girl , you have the talent so please get back to your root . gary w. hill
1	very good
1	very good song !
1	love it
1	my daughter love carrie underwood and ha all of her cd .
0	ooh , an electronica pop christmas song ! no , wait . it is another lady gaga song about sex where she turn everything into innuendo . guess what the christmas tree is . yep . at least it wa free and i did not waste any money on it .
0	i hate the song sweet home alabama . kid rock combined this song with that now i can not get it out of my head . not that sweet home alabama is a bad song but i have heard way too many time . i grew up in mississippi and i wa worn out on the song by time i wa five .
0	clean version ,
1	my niece love it !
1	excellent to listen and relax or utilize for meditation into the salvation of christ for u all . help you with your time speaking to god one on one . perfect for catholic or any other follower of jesus .
0	the item wa ( it ) broken
0	im not sure if i like it or not - i finally listened to it by having my car record it to it harddrive and i have the wrong cd it is jeremy camp with the following 5 song : trust in you , enough , empty me , i wait for the lord and revive me . not even the chainsmokers . weird . the cd case and the artwork on the cd are all chainsmokers : bouquet . none of the music is chainsmokers . again weird !
0	i do not hate the music , i bought this piece because i loved it for year , and wanted to hear it reformatted . but the recording i purchased is somehow scrambled , like different track are playing out of order in some place . not what i remembered at all ! i hope amazon can fix it .
0	this wa given to me from my daughter and son-in-law a a joke . because it is . all the 4 & 5 star review crack me up ! especially the one from the holier-than-thou hard core dylan fan . particularly the one who are snubbing their nose down at u critical one who just do not get it . lolololol ! the review are about a entertaining a the cd itself . the 5 star review are so serious ! unbelievable . ( same thing on itunes- if you want some great entertainment , read the review there for both camp . hilarious ! ) i do not care if you are a bob dylan connoisseur , you have got to know horrible singing when you hear it and a total mismatch of voice to genre . though i find this cd of immensely more entertainment value than listening to say , some opera singer like domingo trying to convince u that he can sing pop , it is horrible in the worse way ! more horrible than rod stewart trying to sing jazz standard , even . it is so horrible it is so * entertaining * ! i am going to share this with all my fellow conductor and music grad student . a well a non-musical friend . i know they will howl with either delight or pain or both ! one of the best thing about this cd is the juxtapositioning of the very lovely backup singer who are almost angelic . with them contrasted against dylan singing it is almost like he hired them to totally mock him ! oh man , i am listening to this a i type . it hurt my throat so much just listening to him . a one die-hard fan said , this will indeed become a landmark album- much in the same way that william shatners the transformed man is . thank you , bob dylan , for this wonderful christmas present . we will listen to it , or a portion of it , every christmas just for a tear-producing laugh . it is a good thing that christmas is in [ his ] heart because it definitely aint in his voice !
0	pay atttention . from a mix tape and doe not have the whole song ( pointless )
1	terry kath in his heyday jamming over a funky vamp before transitioning into bobby lamms bluesy ballad . loud , raw , and improvisational gibson s-g handiwork make this tune my favorite early chicago piece of work , circa , 1969 .
1	the first cut is the deepest is a 1967 song written by cat stevens , originally released by p. p. arnold in may 1967. stevens own version originally appeared on his album new master in december 1967. this one is ok , but cat version is the best .
1	this is the music from the opening scene of the movie , layer cake , wherein daniel craig play a fascinating , vulnerable role a a middle man for a recreational medication group in the uk . interesting concept for a movie , and the music grab your attention , also .
1	i can relate to this song all the way around because my father passed away in 2011 and he including my mother and i knew it wa his time to let go . i listen to this song in memory of him .
0	i swear this is a very good parody of bob dylan singing of christmas song . it is , is not it ? please tell me it is . please .
1	brandi is one of my all time favorite artist and this album doe not disappoint . i definitely recommend it to anyone who love great music .
0	to begin i do not pretend to be recording/sound engineer of any kind once so ever , however , this album a stated by other fellow disenchanted listener sound rather empty . the sheer sound of each song along resembles something up and coming artist from the late 90 would have have submitted to company a a demo . i understand being an artist and expanding the bounardies , but with this album i fail to see that expansion , and if anything , the feel appears to be reflecting the mood , not neccessairly the word , of the so-called economic recovery of the united state . overall , if this were his first album , it would receive a higher rating , but it is not . i truly find it amazing that jack johnson insists on using renewable source of energy to power his recording session ; i just find it hard to believe what with all the recording software out there that this dry , hollow , and virtually flat sound wa the best he and his engineer could come up with . if this is supposed to sell people on the green movement and it approach to recording , i suggest finding someone else .
1	amazon make purchasing song really easy and is unmatched in quality when it come to the ease of purchase and the quality of it all .
0	i have been a jewel fan for a long long time . i saw jewel before she became famous for piece of you and instantly fell in love . i loved her style , her voice , her word - everything . while piece of you will always be my favorite album , i still found solice in all the others - until now ! what wa she thinking . i fell in love with the girl sitting on the stage with her guitar , speaking to the crowd with her song . her concert were intimate . when spirit came out , she added a band to her act , and while i wasnt thrilled , i could deal with it because at least she wa still writing those deep lyric that made me shiver at time . then about 8 mo . ago i went to see jewel play and i wa so happy to see that she had ditched the band and wa back to playing with just her and her guitar ! so now , 8 mo . later , i fear that girl is gone completely ! i never thought jewel would sell out and write such bland , on the surface lyric and pimp herself to an audience that love the poppy meaningless song of britney spear ! at first when i saw the video for intuition , i could not believe it wa jewel ! then i thought well this song seems to be putting down those who sell out . so i thought that maybe this song wa the only one of it kind on the album , but it wasnt . with the song intuition - jewel is a hyprocrit because she ha sold herself to just cash in .
0	he tried something new , but it did not work .
1	excellent
0	this album count only in too deep and fat lip a decent song . the rest is , well , all filler . and the record is only half an hour long , so there are only about another five complete song ( track one is a reminder of maiden ` s number of the beast and track three is 50 second long ) . it make you wonder if the guy that wrote the two hit single wrote the rest of the album a well . piece of advice , tape or download the single and spend your money on something else .
0	it did nothing for me , i lost not one pound .
1	might be my favorite radiohead album ever . the instrumentation is gorgeous . thom yorkes voice is at it best .
0	absolutely horrible pressing . save your money and just go with the 2016 remaster . i got this on a daily deal , but even at that price , it wasnt worth it . sound distant and there is absolutely no dynamic range . the bass is nonexistent , and wa quieter than most of my other record . i have listened to it about 3 time now , just to see if it needed to break in a bit . nope ! just horrible .
1	prince . wa . one . of . the . greatest . of . all . time . and . i. love . his . music
1	it is a song , you either like it or you do not . i like it and therefore am recommending it to you . : )
0	this is a rather strange compilation . the individual track have little in common , other than that they were made for movie . this is a mix of monophonic and stereo track a well a of instrumentals and vocal . it contains fairly new music a well a some very old music . the audio quality is quite good though some of the older track do have that narrow band sound that mark many sound track . this mixed bag ha very little going for it . it would have been far better is they would selected the track in some manner . it would have been far better a a collection of music from early film or of more recent film . a it is , it is a hodge podge that i really can not recommend to anyone .
0	i must have ordered this by mistake because i do not remember it . wa i supposed to download it or what ? i would like my money back please
1	i love anything royalty free . this album ha everything in 30 sec , 60 sec , and full track . these track range from movie track to high energy rock . with this album you get over 50 track . i will use this high quality music and in my independent film project .
1	little and ashley harmonize very well in this recording . the lyric bring vision of a beautiful winter night outdoors with a smattering of bell . who doe not like sleigh bell ? i like it !
0	i am not sure when this cd wa released but it certainly is doe not contain the original version . in fact , i am not even sure it is really buck fizz ( it is that bad. ) . if you have never heard anything by them before , do not buy this cd . if you have heard them before , do not buy this cd . ick .
0	i am confused a to how to listen to this track . where do i go ? my review ha nothing to do about rihanna , she is great and i love this song . that is why i bought it ! i wa just disappointed when i went to listen to the song and i had no idea where to go . why can not it just download straight to itunes ? it would have been so much easier !
0	i heard a live performance of the imagine dragon and really enjoyed the music , so i ordered the album . the album unfortunately is a huge disappointment . the mastering of this album is terrible . a number of the song on this album have an over-driven/distortion sound effect . when you hear the song live , the effect is compelling and the sound pressure add to the performance . but on the album version the distortion/effect is overwhelming and absolutely crush the music . i ran the album through a live music audio enhancer ( claesson edward live audio enhancer ) and it helped quite a bit . normally when looking at the oscilloscope the before is narrow and the after is open . not with song like radioactive , the before is scattered and full of clipping . which help to explain why the song sound better on the radio then on your stereo ; because they have been processed and helped ( not fixed ) . the end result is an album that sound progressively worse the better your audio playback is .
1	this is a very pleasant disc to listen to . excellent arrangement of many standard , each with an excellent combination of voice . well worhgt adding to your collection .
1	perfect for reminiscing . affordable price esay download and i can carry this part of my past with me for whenever i need a blast from the past .
1	group 1 crew is an amazing band , and this album doe not disappoint ! i bought it for my sister and she love it . came in excellent packaging and we are enjoying it very much .
1	brilliant a always !
1	my husband loved it !
1	the first time i heard this song , it wa during a time where i wa sad almost every day . thing were not looking good for me . but the song , the lyric spoke to me and helped me to cheer up . very inspirational for me .
0	so why are you asking me to review it ? this is a stupid automated review process controlled by software clearly written by some idiot programmer . stop pestering your customer to work for you without compensation by writing review !
0	ac/dc fan will love to rock out with the master of rock . the recording are great , the hit keep coming song after song .
1	beautiful . great acoustic . great ballad
0	i paid for the song because i wanted the mp3 . after i paid for it , it will only let me listen to it through amazon . that doe me no good . i want the mp3 that i paid for .
0	i received the album and it looked great except for the dint in the sleeve and when i opened it it had a dint in the record !
0	this review is about the quality of the vinyl , not the quality of the music . my copy of this album skipped several time , most notably on the song deck dark . always in the exact same spot . a this is unacceptable , i had to send it back .
1	top gun
1	i think it a different side of beyonce , i feel she is confessing her love for jay z and how they compliment each other by saying that she isdrunk in love , great record and very sexy video
1	i wa suprised that this song wa good . i wasnt expecting much from an american idol person , but this song proved me wrong . hopefully the rest of his music is a good a this song
0	i downloaded this on accident . gave it a listen and turned it off . saw the video and almost threw up in my mouth . this is not hiphop . probably some kind of wierd rap music
1	sublime .
1	it is light hearted and happy . it fit in nicely a background for a slideshow i did .
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she ha honestly been one of the most severely overexposed artist of the past decade , and sadly the quality of her voice ha slowly withered away . kanye west ha not been musically better with his frill , from marrying kim kardashian , to making his stage antic on taylor swift and recently beck on his grammy-winning album of the year . now , for the two of them to team up with paul mccartney , the question is have they have better in their art , well the answer is absolutely no . kanye showed it badly on only one , now with fourfive second , the two of them do not ignite in the heart , instead they have shown to be a whimper of themselves in voice , and in chemistry with sir paul . overall , i wasnt even impressed with the song , and honestly much worse than what the two of them have done in song before . if you are a die hard paul mccartney fan , i would sincerely pas this one up , because four and five second , feel more like wasted time overall . song : f
0	with no doubt in my mind this is the worst unplugged album i have seen . katty perry simply is a studio artist . doe not worth to see her live singing . bad bad bad
1	great album !
0	only 3 good song .
1	i lost my cd of the manhattan so i picked up my hit here . great love song .
1	a perfect guide for a lasting relationship . instruction on how to make a marriage be happy for 75 year and more .
0	i am a huge floyd fan . i love everything since dark side , and much from before dark side . i love post-waters floyd , floyd with roger water , and i love a lot of the solo song from water , from gilmour , and from wright . i did not enjoy this album . i heard it once through and that wa enough . i do not think it is a money grab , it just suck . edit : perhaps floyd , or at least those that remain , deserve an album retrospect , in whatever way they desire . that is what i consider this . i just would not have bought it if i had heard it first .
1	love this song . it is truly magic ! my fave coldplay song in a while . looking forward to the rest of the album .
1	mc flepp ( roman flepp ) from liricas analas rap in romansh ( sursilvan ? ) and graubnden swiss-german . i am not a romansh speaker . i will say i am a student of german so i find it really cool whenever i can make out small bit of the swiss-german : ) . i think romansh is a very lovely , musical language , very pleasing to the ear , and flepp work wonder with his mothertongue . the beat are planned really well , flepp ha a voice that ( imho ) is perfect for his music , and every track on this album is laid out with sensibility . he go through a lot of different style , from mellow to jazzy . very refreshing . guest include liricas analas on mettavon and mc spoon on musica .
0	first off . i am a big fan of hln which is why i bought this cd . this cd ha once again proved that music is a business and this wa just that . business . huey wa quoted recently that he ha employee and want to keep them employed , with benefit . interview with ew : so there is got to be a market out there . but how you get to them , i have no idea . and you know what ? i am not interested . - huey lewis on cd sale . aside from jumping on the yesterday bandwagon with the like of rod stewart , sheryl crow and others , the news a usual delivers a great polished performance worthy of one of the best backing band in the history of music . hueys voice however lack enthusiasm and sound forced to say the least . most of the positive 4 and 5 star review on here are from hlns website . huey singing about a turd in a toilet would be 5 star to them ! i strongly encourage you to skip this one and purchase another cd from hln from their heyday ( 1980 - 1999 ) . on that note , if huey want to secure his employee , why not release a dvd box set or original material ?
0	i had no idea that 9 out of 10 song were not original recording and 5 out of those 9 were flat out horrible . do not waste your money if you want original . i had forgotten how bad k-tell recording were
0	a lot of people have praised this disc - but i am not one of them . this recording is many thing , but the soundtrack it is not ! despicable me ha a very good film score composed by pharrell williams with the addition of a number of song also written by him . this disc ha the song that appeared in the film - but not one note of the score ! despicable is the word for this disc - because it only delivers a small sample of the film background music . and the score is a significant element in any film . without the score , all this disc doe is deliver the icing on the cake without the cake . if , like me , you enjoy film score , then this disc is one you should skip .
0	sounded like pure dog poo . his career is finished for suing h3h3 , go to hell
0	i wa disappointed with this purchase . the song were not the kind i enjoy . i believe it sold by jakes name .
0	lucinda williams , the finest songwriter of the century , need to return to the great song she wrote in the beginning of her career . the only song on west that i really liked wa west . i will continue to buy all her album anyway , i think she is great !
1	good song
0	i wanted to buy this song but when i tried to preview it , the song is just not the one . please check it .
1	the used cd came from library-by the-lake , and wa exactly a discribed . it wa in perfect condition and arrived quickly , without damage . the life action singer produce great music and this cd is one of their best .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
1	a beautiful song . i created a cd to use in my work a a massage therapist , and included this song . lovely !
0	not a favorite . i prefer a more celtic sounding version of this song . i wa disappointed in this version . sorry .
1	this is a very good album . saw him perform some of these song at sacramento , ca in 1971 .
1	very happy with our purchase and delivery .
1	it is a very fun song that encourages you to keep your head up and enjoy life . you will turn out fine . : )
1	who would not like jb ? he is excellent- what is priceless ? amazon prime- gave a whole of his music free .
1	love it
0	when i purchased this product it would not download . i could get no help from amazon . it wasnt worth pursuing it for 99 cent .
0	a much a i can scream out expletive about the grrrrrreatness of qaf the show , the soundtrack fall sadly mediocre . it tout itself a almost like being in babylon ( a dancejoint that doe not exist in real life ) , well i guess it doe in a way , but it doe not capture the whole feel of babylon . i wa expecting remixes and stuff ! where is it ? on the whole i guess it an o.k . compilation . a lot of you will not really get what i am saying but , that is okay too . the british soundtrack is actually better .
0	not good . at all .
0	this is an absolutely horrible copy of one of the finest performance ever recorded . the cracking noise make it almost unlistenable , completely unworthy of the quality of gmos fine session . you can hear the crackle in the preview - yes , it is that bad and worse all the way through . i am surprised anyone bothered to release such a bad copy ; sound like it wa made with a 40-year-old turntable on cheap equipment . this recording of the same performance is much cleaner : http : / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0013arzcm/
0	whoever told this person that she could sing is a cruel heartless individual . not only is she tone deaf not talented and annoying , she actually sound like she is trying . id hate to hear what she sound like on an off day . i think this music wa meant for prisoner of war that are meant to go through psychological torture . please , do yourself a favor do not listen to this album or anything else by this artist . i guarantee that you will lose some respect for where music is heading in our time if you do . i am forced to give this only one star and that in my opinion is very generous a i do not even think it is worthy of review . i only do this to warn my fellow music lover .
1	fresh worshipper leader that will help you enter into the presence of the lord .
1	my new favorite song .
1	man i wish i wa on the us missouri when cher wa there getting her sing on
1	a good song you don t hear everyday . a great song for those who are in love for the first time !
1	at first i thought this wa a keith urban but i wa surprised that it wa jason mraz , but i still love it .
1	there are really only a few thing in life we can count on . one is that we will die . another is that motorhead is going to release a pulse pounding , heavy , jam filled album and once again , they do not disappoint at all . mikkey dee sound amazing and purely flawless on the drum while campbell play his guitar masterfully busting out memorable and furious solo . despite all the health problem lemmy ha had this year , he still sings powerfully and captivates with an angry , heavy snarling vocal performance . the song are a catchy a ever and shoot out all the light contains a great call and response section . motorhead have always been capable of busting out a great ballad and this doe not change with the infectious til the end . every song is a riveting and heavy performance by this trio and then we hit the grand finale , a cover of the rolling stone sympathy for the devil . not very many band could pull off a stone cover , but holy crap doe motorhead slay this song ! i wa smiling from ear to ear . lemmy doe not try to mimic jagger but instead put his own unique snarling spin on the vocal while phil play a couple of perfect solo to compliment dees tight and fluid drumming . this album is pretty much perfect and this band need a # 1 in the u.s. so i urge you , if you want some talented classic metal in your life , pick this album up .
1	how could you go wrong with live zepp at any price !
0	it is great to hear an artist expand their horizon . i just wish jewel would have went more to the woman horizon than the teenager horizon if you know what i mean . can not get in to this pop deluxe stuff . some of the rave review puzzle me . this cd almost embarrasses me to listen to it . not trying to say jewel should stay confined but , just because record sale are lagging a bit , doe that mean an artist ha to tap in to the pre-teen money machine for the sake of pleasing everything jewel seemed to want to tell u to rise above ? i believe some call that particular horizon selling out . did jewel sell out here ? i try not to think about how this album cast a shadow on all the anti-estblishment and human point of view jewel seemed to be telling u she felt in her heart . i know everyones got bill to pay , but some thing are more important than having mound and mound of money and making record just to sell and satisfy fat record company . we have one britney spear . we do not need anything resembling anther one . i hope jewel find a way to put a bit more spirit in her next album . i would hate to think jewel feel she need to serve her ego .
0	this album is 1 star because most of the song are unlistenable . i do not enjoy listening to this album . i do not recommend this album . addy .
1	i have given a few copy of the cd and guide to family and friend because it brings one closer to the blessed mother and in touch with the lord . i listen to it driving , working out or when i feel i need to quiet myself . susan ha really done a great job with this and it is worth the purchase .
1	it is thrice
0	wtf is this trash . this album suck . the weekend killin you
0	i like the song very much . my copy skip . the gifted copy i sent to my girlfriend , turn up on her phone , but she must purchase . how do i get a refund ?
0	the absolutely worst song ever made . if you like screaming through the whole song , then you will love it . me , i like some melody and rhythm and not a bunch of woooo aaaaaa eeeeaaaaaaa .
0	the creedence clearwater revival album mardi gras is often hailed a the all time worst album by a major rock group . i strongly believe this t.j. & s album ha it way beat . at least the john fogerty song on mardi gras are classic a usual , it is just the rest of the group really ruined that album . i could not find one worthy song on this messterpiece . do not get me wrong , i love most of t.j. & s other song but this album is just so bad . tommy james & the shondells were not in the same class a ccr but they were a major rock group with only one le hit than ccr . if you count the tommy james solo hit draggin the line then they are tied . bottom line is ccr wa a classic album group and t.j. & s were strictly a single group .
1	my little boy will listen to this song over and over . great way for memorizing scripture .
1	beautiful
0	this cd is absolute garbage . sellout britny spears/green day clone pop for public consumption . avoid everything from descendent and all in the 90 and later !
0	i wa told this wa happy music . i find it boring & depressing . i am tossing it .
0	this title is mangled - disco beat , sputtering word that are incomprehesible , then dead silence .
1	this is grammy award material .
0	i gave this a listen . a friend of mine know i am a big fan of frank , etc , so he thought i would like this . but , like so many young guy out there trying to sing like sinatra ( i am looking at you , mike buble ! ) , they fail because they have no heart . now , technically , seth is a good singer . i do not particularly care for his singing voice , but obviously he is got some talent there . i almost appreciate the 1958-era style of the album cover . i would like it more if they were not trying so hard to invoke the image of frank old lp cover . but seth singing ha absolutely no heart , no soul , whatsoever . and this is what is missing in the singing of today ; anyone who think they can pull off singing , doe , and we are left with a glut of talented singer , very few of whom i ever care to hear . this is one of them . i just can not take it . it is empty singing . no heart . - not to mention , it is frickin brian griffin singing ! ? impossible to listen to .
0	this type of music doe not follow the rule . whatever happened to good old-fashioned church music ? i am serious . this type of music , known by most in the ward a rock or metal must be burned and flushed down the toilet . i had to whip my son with my leather belt because he wa playing this kind of music rather than playing gospel music on the piano . nirvana wa not a good band . the lead yeller committed suicide , which is a direct pathway to hell and a guaranteed dance with the horrible satan . if you are like me , you will not even think about this album and try to convince others to burn this album and get rid of it forever . i hate rock and roll and i have taken it upon myself a my duty to get rid of modern music and bring back the gospel music of the holy mormon church .
1	always love josh groban . in perfect condition !
1	help is another great album recorded by the beatles . few other artist had their rate of consistency . song like help , the night before , ticket to ride , and tell me what you see are true true rock song . act naturally is almost country . you have got to hide your love away , it is only love and i have just seen a face are very much like folk song . yesterday and i need you are classic ballad . no le essential than any of the other beatles album . buy it .
1	the sound is rich , the harmony are deep , the arrangement are original . i have played it many time and recommended it to friend .
1	i love this song . it is exactly the same a what i had heard from the dvd . great quality sound . i stored the sound in my amazon cloud .
0	i am a huge manowar fan since 1982. i have a tattoo of manowar on my right arm . i have seen the band live probably 12 time both in the u and in europe , and have met them personally on occasion . it pain me to say it but this album is horrid . yes , the production is poor but that is not the main problem . the song themselves would not have made any of teh previous album . ( i liked god of war ) . this is the first manowar album i have heard ( and i have heard them all - many time ) that lay totally flat , sound bad , and doe not have a single song that i find worthy . i would not expect many , or any , of these track to make it to a live show . i am still a fan of the band , i always will be , but i need to call it what it is ; horrid .
1	jeff williams second outing a composer for rwby is a home run . he creates wonderful music that get your blood pumping and your head bobbing . personal favorite track are shine and caffeine , but they are all great track that is just a awesome a rwby itself .
0	disappointed , but never with much hope . it is a shame .
1	great song
0	not a good a i hoped it would be
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	while the arrangement of this cover get 5 star , this performance of it get 1 ( it would get 0 if that were an option ) . if you want to hear the original cover , which wa done while giving proper credit where it wa due , check out jonathan coulton ! also , purchase the one that is in the style of glee so that the purchase go to a good cause . < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/baby-got-back-in-the-style-of-glee/dp/b00b6lrx34/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > baby got back ( in the style of glee ) < /a >
1	nice ! i play it when cleaning up the house ! nice blend of music ! some folk can relate to what i am talking about . : )
1	great uplifting soul album from this baltimore-based quartet . this is a real band using real instrument and the lead vocalist ha one of the most authentic old-school type soul voice i have heard this year . these are all original song too . the music is very gospel influenced though far from preachy , and it is consistently good listening from start to finish . i do have favourite though , including the fantastic opener , never leave you lonely , hope too high , breathe love , maybe i am not the man , evil woman ( which i am sure us the riff from donny hathaway valdez in the country , though this is not acknowledged ) , they do not know , time stop ( heartfelt balladry at it best ) and the funky closer , it aint over . this is how music is supposed to be made and why this group is not being hailed from the rooftop , i will never know . i would never have heard of them if not for a uk-based black music monthly magazine . if you like soul like it wa made back in the day , you will probably love this . get a copy while you can .
1	awesome
0	did not order this item
1	just amazing after all these year . i have petitioned james taylor to put out a dvd of the current tour since they are not coming anywhere near southern california . but , these track are all wonderful and the accompanying dvd is a wonder and joy to behold . do not doubt it , if you like james taylor , get this one . hurry !
0	this remake of dylan music is almost unrecognizable and disturbing to the ear . it wa sad . a i like ben sidrans style but this is a joke and i wa super sad i ordered it . mr sidran is from my home town and i wanted to support him , the local review were favorable . but it is awlful and i will put it in to my resale or charity box for the next drop off trip. < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/dylan-different/dp/b002upq1q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > dylan different < /a >
1	just like the movie .
1	we just got this for christmas and it is a wonderful cd ! my four year old is asking great question about the song .
1	this album is a great example of the jazz and fusion stuff that wa going on in the 70 and 80 . while i think that maynard ferguson wa the epitome of this big band incarnation , woody brought a pretty decent band along a well , even though he wa entering the last decade of his life . amazing guy , amazing version of la fiesta . starting with that electric piano that wa everywhere at the time ( were they all rolands ? ) and ending with a little bit wheezy soprano solo from woody , there is a whole lot of stuff crammed in the middle : shrieking trumpet , a nifty tiberi solo , and awesome dynamic . a good a version a you will find anywhere .
1	great album for the linkin park fan .
0	stevie is always good .
1	beautifull rendition of this song . soul and feeling from this talented young lady . a bit slower than the original which showcase jena beautiful voice .

0	we tried two cd and neither played in our 2 stereo . not sure what is wrong with them but we could not get any sound . sad . my 89 year old mom wa excited
0	i like bar and band version of song , but this ha too much not funny in it for me . it is one thing to be drunk and hear story and laugh about shooting your neighbor cat , sleeping with your cousin , sister , brother , dad , or whatever else is in this music . line about the anus detract from the music for me . clean it up , be a little more creative and this could be good late night bonfire music .
1	my 6 year old grandaughter had the volume up for hour while she played the cd . she will be listening to it for a long time . grammpa
0	i really thought this album wa going to be a game changer . boy wa i wrong . i feel like this is a boring album . i only enjoyed a few song such a medicated and the plan . rolling paper had a couple song i love and still listen to on a regular basis ( when i am gone & camera ) . this album could have been so much more . all the hype and the push back for such an average album
1	amazing work from alt j a always , my favorite song on the album are nara and every other freckle .
1	one of my favorite contemporary christian artist . the song and lyric stir my spirit and uplift my soul . i always feel rejuvenated and inspired after listening .
1	i love these techno version . dj doomsday , please make more of these song . god bless you . now i can dance and worship at the same time .
0	aint nothing like 2 crackheads in love brings back memory doe not it remember when they both hooked up cocaine wa indeed a hell of a drug .
1	i really liked this album when it first came out . one of the song wa even featured on starsky and hutch . do not give up on u baby wa a great go to song for couple and i really liked the rest of the song a they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of southern flavor or new orleans flavor . it is hard to explain . each song can hold it is own . even though david soul is best known a an actor/director he did a great job with playing to an audience of one . i do not believe you will be disappointed with this selection .
0	the mp # version ha a nasty skip in voldomiro - the first track !
0	definitely not his best work . song either to rap or slow . nothing like his last 2 album . it ha to grow on me or a big waste of money .
1	found it very easy to purchase directly from my kindle , love it . look forward to purchasing more song in the future
0	when it ha came down to beyonce knowles , and today diva , she ha became the most overexposed product in music today . sadly , the quality of her voice ha died and so ha she in song . but nevertheless , when she wa a part of destiny child , she made the decision to make a solo effort and try and prove she is more in voice and heart . her solo debut song crazy in love is the very least her benchmark into her solo work , and the beginning of her relationship with her husband jay-z . they have had other collaboration for her career like the wasted deja vu , and the recent drunk in love which sounded more like a waste of time in voice and heart , and bonnie & clyde 03. it is not a good song , because it ha been overplayed but the very least it is her best work with her husband . still , there need to be better in voice and being crazy in love . song : d+
1	great
0	the mix on this song is awful , the background noise take over which tell me they are trying to hide a lot of flaw in nias voice . she is from the t.v . show dance mom and should have let abby lee miller produce her song . abby a she doe in everything that she work on put out excellence song for the girl she produce . nia and her mom holly made a big mistake not using abby : a this song is awful , even the title is bad what doe a 14-15 year old know about staring in your own life ? the cover is tacky , it look like they used microsoft word to spell nias name in shadow ! bad all the way around . save your money and order kendall vertes song wear em out now that is a great song and you can buy it on amazon for .99 cent . your picture on the cover should have been centered . sorry , nia i am afraid a music career is not for you .
1	love it !
1	i will make this brief a usual . tha animatrix dvd is what turned me onto anime , it is also a slight bit disturbing , but you know a well a i do that u 21st century human need to be disturbed once in a while . i always loved the music from the dvd , so decided , why not get the soundtrack ? and i did . what i did not expect is that the soundtrack is better than the movie ( in musical term ) . there is only one track on this cd that i do not like , and that is saying a lot . it is an interesting journey . through a synthetic world , via trance and techno beat . check it out , you will not be disappointed .
0	it is totaly amazing that this wa created . what make sindel think that horrid classical march will sound better when played ( very badly , i might add ) on electric guitar . the tone he us are more annoying then a cat fight under your bedroom window . this is totaly unlistenable garbage that ha no merrit whatsoever . this might well be the worst cd i have ever bought . i hope this will be the total extent of sindels musical offering . putrid !
0	music is great-it will not download to my phone ! ?
1	great product delivered very fast
1	if nothing else , i highly recommend light by battleme . great haunting song that replay in my head over and over . i can even see the image of jax following juice in his truck a this song is being played .
0	disc 2 of this digital audiobook is damaged . i tried downloading it a couple time , but it always skip repeatedly after about 23 minute into that disc . this is the equivalent of selling a new paper book with missing/ripped page . unacceptable .
0	this is another case where le is more . i found the sound of rain to be very heavy and unrelenting . instead of a sound of a refreshing spring shower i felt i wa caught in a deluge .
1	great album ! no track on it that i dislike ; every one is worth listening to . the lyric are interesting , the musical style is varied and frankly just sound cool , and it is a nicely long album which i always appreciate . worth every penny .
0	i ordered this cd based on one song i had heard . it turn out that is the only good song on it . the rest of the cd is not anything i want to listen to . what else can i say ? steer clear .
1	i really like to listen to something other than the same tune over and over again everywhere you go . this is upbeat and it brings a wonderful feeling and an upbeat tune . i enjoy listening to this over and over again . i would love to find more of these kind of new tune . new to me anyway .
1	nice sound but you need a very quiet environment to listening yo yo ma
0	uninspired garbage . such a disappointment . i have been with manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out . i could not be more unhappy . uninspired is the best way to describe it . it seems so half-assed when compared to their previous album .
1	posiblemente la cancin m famosa de don omar , el cantante bein conocido . hay que comprarlo ; esta versin e impresionante . el mejor de la versiones hoy .
0	wow , talk about zero originality ! what do you do when you can not come up with anything original to save your life ? ripoff an old surf instrumental~ what else !
0	could not stomach much of this . slow , lifeless , abomination of the real symphony . depressing .
1	this is a great collection of new wave jazz from him . one of the greatest . it is a classic . it is raw and contemporary . his piano skill are amazing get this one you will not be disappointed
0	wow . i wa hoping for more like his first 2 album and wa severely disappointed . nirvana . really ? not great listening .
0	most of these are only portion of the song , such a 1 verse and the chorus . i would prefer the entire song . also , many are done with a country feel to them , not the traditional music you would hear in church . i downloaded it to have song for senior citizen to sing along with , and it is not a hit . wa glad i downloaded it from amazon though a i-tunes wa 3 time the price .
1	i love this cd . barbra is amazing !
0	a i began listening to this album , two cyclist started chasing me down the street ! i got no action from this album at all .
1	her voice is awesome . she could sing the worst song ever , and make it sound like silk !
0	i really get sad when i hear this new rap crap on top of the greatest band ever . i used to go see these guy when nobody even knew who they were . maybe show of 50 or 75 people . that wa the good ol day . god do i miss the house man !
1	i love this album . favorite include anthem , run , outlaw , scared , chasing twister , and my whole life long . after it all make me weep with joy . if you have never seen them live , do not miss the chance . anyone can sound decent in the studio with a thousand take , few sound even better live and delta rae definitely sound even better live .
0	they play this song so many time when this came out and gosh will he ever go away ? he is overrated and need to work at mcdonalds cause no one lovin it .
0	what happened
0	i had watched the season that jordin wa on in american idol . i had heard this song on the radio ( probably too much ? ) and decided to download today based on a snippet i heard today . i have to say i like the song , but the ending is really [ . ] . of course now given the whole chris brown thing it make me feel disgusted about him in general , but really this song is a sappy love song and the ending is nothing but them shouting out random chord and overly emotional note that seem to compete more and more with each other the longer it go along to prove they have singing ability . and it seems to go along tooooo long . i know you can both sing . modern day air supply . blech . but might appeal to a lot of people . just not me . just my opinion : )
1	this is the best song the widespread panic ha ever released . i love it . no matter my mood this song always pick me right up .
0	bought for airline flight for off line it is in the cloud and can not lisen off line
1	strangely oriental but totally captivating with those five note in the opening . absolutely love this one . keep it up tom rhett !
0	i cd di questi gruppi r & b sono tutti uguali - the same old story
1	i had a favorite album back in high school entitled the rock album . can not seem to locate it anywhere . but here , on amazon , i can piece the album together using itunes ! voila !
0	sad sad album ! a an old fan of marilyn mccoo i jumped to buy it when i saw she had a new release . to my deception ! the album is a collection of old hit produced like it wa recorded in a lobby of a 2 star hotel ! they both lost a lot of their velvet voice from the past though marilyn mccoo still keep her perfect and crystal clear english . the highlight of this album is her reedition of bacharahs this girl in love with you . there are two extra dowloadable song that only god know how it work to get it ! if you are a fan of hers you will still get it but do not expect it to be what it used to be ! i had it because i am still faithfull !
0	i am a big fan of terry hall and the colourfields fantastic first album , virgin & philistine , but with personnel change and a different vibe , this album pale in comparison . terry voice is still great but he go in a different direction musically and it is just not on par with the first album in my opinion , which is still one of my favorite from the mid-80s .
1	mix in well with other song in cardio workout . when you get a little winded this will help keep you up .
0	all 4 side were completely scratched and the record would skip every other note
0	huge wz and rz here . this album is a bit disappointing . some have equated it to an ep and i agree . i believe rob is believing any crap he put out there is cool , well . it aint . love john 5 playing and hope rob put out more serious lyric and music next time .
0	while the package art is nice , i think that is about the best part of this disc . the best song are at the end of the disc , and the new vocalist is o.k. , but not a jon anderson . most of the song on the cd sound the same and feel monotonous . i have listened to this about a dozen time , thinking it would grow on me , but i just do not enjoy it .
1	another get out of your seat raise your hand and praise god song . this song touch the heart and the spirit
1	awesome song !
1	is a gift
0	the only two song that are worth listening for me are the disco song . i wa extremely disappointed in the despicable me song , i wa expecting the song like in the opening of the film and i wa le than happy when a chorus of childrens ( ? ) voice started chiming in . i do not recall that from the movie at all . i enjoy the movie very much , but i can not recommend this album if your interest lie in more of the movie version of the song rather than the song on this cd . i should have demoed the song before ordering , but i do like the disco song that are not available for download .
1	a advertised . very nice .
0	downloaded it but it ha the same defect a the 30 year old cd track .
0	the album is great . the sound quality of the vinyl pressing wa made for crosley , and sound like isht . oh well , at least it look cool in white
0	i had to pay to listen to this song even tho i am a prime member and it is prime music !
0	i feel like a traitor saying this , but i will not be buying this set any time soon . i stand second-to-none in my affection for the band , but unfortunately , this career-spanning retrospective is seriously lacking in representation of the last 30 year of that recording career . by my count , there are only about five song on this set that were released after 1980. not good enough . capitol is not getting my money again until they come up with a beach boy compilation that is a whole lot heavier on newly-gathered song , and a whole lot lighter on the re-re-retreads .
0	why is amazon selling nazi propaganda ?
1	great song to give someone the nerve to speak their mind .
0	purchased but did not download to my playlist
1	it is prince . duh !
1	diana krall is a real cool chick on this number .
1	best song ever
1	thank you , maurice white , for sharing your great talent with the world . you will live on through this incredible tune .
0	stupid .
1	i have to say is that rick ross ha been thru the ups and down of ppl coming at him and dissing him well this album back every thing up rick ross is coming off real nice on this album . teflon don the album is more of an chilling laid back more kind of an album . song like free mason is really nice track over all the whole album is a worth of a pick pick up it better the drake album drake ha a good album to a well . maybach music 3 is i real nice track to check out to guy go get this album .
1	great song
0	do not like it
1	hear it for yourself !
1	both song featured on this one were very good . the instrumental version were nice addition a well . the last track is a talk segment , which is why this is 4 star .
1	like most people , i only buy song i have already heard and liked , so . yeah , i think it is good .
1	love it
1	good album .
0	please stop playing this song a hold music ! is your goal to get me to hang up ?
1	love it . hate it . it is going to live on a one of the greatest album of all time . forever remembered a the band that made the majority of people remember what good rock music wa , ( some of u knew . it wa called the underground scene ) i mean let face it , if anyone remembers 1991 ( and i do not mean being 8 ) you know that smell like teen spirit blew everyone away . mainstream rock wasnt supposed to be that good . not at that time anyways . it changed the mainstream . for the better ? i dunno , . basically hmmm , i wonder what they will like next remember the spin doctor ? bush ? yea . a far a the underground go . i have never read any underground legend say anything bad about nirvana . biafra , rollins , joey ramone , iggy . heck iggy used to go to nirvana show and go insane . if anything ive heard all of them say how much they were flattered about being inspiration to nirvana music . yea , even jello . bottom line is this : they put out 3 lp , 1 b-side lp , a acoustic album that blew everyone away a 2nd time . and basically had everyone talking . act like korn , system of a down , tool , manson , blink , where are they gon na be in 10 year . more importantly how are they gon na be remembered ? i have no idea , but i know how nirvana is going to be remembered for the next billion . this album is the reason why . nevermind .
0	honestly . i hate this song . i bought it because my band cover it and i had to learn it . it is another in a long list of those annoying kiss anthem . i respect them and really like some of their stuff . ace wa a bos ! . but this is just campy .
1	it omnia enough said : )
0	i agree with the two other review saying still is tired here . nothing is inspiring here and still look like he is going thru the motion . his guitar solo are good , however his voice sound weak ( due to age i guess ) and i wa tired of the whole thing by the third song both solo and with his band . i think he should just stay with csn where he still shine around his fellow singer crosby and nash . he lack the inspiration playing with his band . he need young to step up and challenge him on stage to really get him going with guitar and crosby/nash to step up his vocal . i wa disappointed with this cd/dvd and will probably put it back in the collection for a repeat playing once in a while ( maybe ) .
1	love this song !
0	not a energetic a other version . i wa expecting a little bit more . might be fine for background music etc , but not the song i wa looking for
0	i hate that anyone think this is burl ives . listen to the other song on this album . listen to the classic from the original animated how the grinch stole christmas . the singer name wa thurl ravenscroft .
1	an awesome pure worship experience that you will want to experience over and over again and never get tired of listening to !
1	i liked this song when i first heard it on the loud speaker at the gym , while i wa working out with weight .
1	heard this on a cable tv play list and had to find it ! had never heard it before and i am glad i did !
0	not the original version
1	so at the beginning of the year after school i went to her concert hunter hay wa on tour with her they were off the chain ! $
0	worse song ever , with all of her success and talent and this is what she creates ? get a life .
1	i got to stream this record free courtesy of npr , and i loved it . it is classic shoegaze with a current sensibility , with melodic groove and even catchy hook complementing the fuzzy guitar and droning vocal . best track is dig , but listen to the whole album from start to finish a intended ; it is a lush trip through a tonal dreamscape .
0	evidently the title simple plan refers to a theory that if you rip off another band hit , you will sell more record . i really do not know where to start with this one . this band rip off every band from u2 to green day to the killer , and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy , with the exception of one pop-punk track , time to say goodbye . it wa said that during the three-plus year that passed between album , that the group singer/songriter ryan bouvier had writer block . this becomes all the more apparent because britney spear songwriting team wa brought in to write several song , making simple plan sound like a boy band . even when they try to rock out , the production is so overdone that the guitar seem distorted and out of place . and there are way too many piano-ballads . i think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two album , which were decent effort packed with pop-punk hook , can permanently be removed now . simple plan will spend the rest of their life wondering if it wa the three-plus year layoff between album or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career . and the answer is neither . it is the lack of originality , energy , and songcraft that will do them in . let face it , when hilary duff rock harder than you , your band is not punk . and in the three and a half year this band wa away , the scene changed , but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band call unchartered musical territory . perhaps uncharted musical territory is more like it . this one is headed to a bargain bin near you , right next to all those old lfo album .
1	i remembered this song one day . and began researching it online . my flate ather once owned the vinyl record . he frequently played different genre of music music around the house . i grew up loving all kind of music . i have not heard this song since childhood . the vinyl record of course is lost now . this digital song wa sung by much the same/similar original artist i would listened to growing up . it brought back wonderful memory of happy childhood day .
1	an enjoyable mix of cuisine , cultural mix and personal transformation . loved it !
1	great song
1	alanis morissette ha a beautiful voice . i had to download it and listen to it often . i really love this song !
1	this more acoustic sound really suit haynes , and is the best i have ever heard him do on his own . railroad earth ( 6 piece new-grass jamband ) provides great support giving all these song ( 8 out of 13 which are haynes original ) an instantly comfortable and enjoyable feel ( like fitting on that perfect boot that will give no blister and last for many mile of trail ) . i enjoyed the whole of disc1 even though haynes song writing itself is only so-so , and the more stripped down demo version on the shorter disc 2 are not bad , although none of them seem essential . in fact , i thought the final live track weak , and the earlier demo are pretty depressing sounding without the cover of more instrumentation . so perhaps a single disc edition would be fine for most fan . overall a great recording with plenty of tasty guitar playing ( especially slide ) from haynes , an apparently tireless artist with a vast and varied palette .
1	very good song
0	another overrated band to grace the late night tv airwave . they do not have much to back up their late night acclaim though . notable song are lacking , this album sound like a kid garage arrangement on some home computer .
0	i think this is her worst song ever . blah ! she is so talented , i can not fathom why she would write such an incipid song a this .
0	i got it for free . at 1st i did not really like it . i like black veil bride and the fray . it is just not my kind of music . now i like this song though . i had to hear it a couple of time before it hit home .
1	great worship song
1	cd wa in great condition
0	sorry but this album is by no stretch a quality record and the beat are horrific probably 20 % of the album good . i do not see why people are raving about this record because it is not even close to a new classic and iggy azalea lack greatness compared to other female rapper and being the face of t.i.s hustle gang she is garbage and yeah go ahead and call out that busta asap rocky cause their both wack .
1	a+
0	when it ha came down to rihanna , she honestly ha been the most overexposed artist of the past several year , where her voice ha lost it luster , and she really ha not stopped for herself . musically , she ha also wasted her spirit a well in her song . her latest song , diamond feel very choppy and her voice sound a bit too course . i really did not find the song to deliver , a some of her earlier song had . i really did not find it to drive into the soul of the voice . i definitely think rihanna need to take more time into her song , and not rush into making album after album , year after year . it really ha put a strain on her talent . talk that talk wa awful , and unapologetic is the same way . song : d-
0	i brought this cd off of impulse and i wa little naive because i did not do my research . i give this album a 2 because it ha a couple new track , but there are only 7 and most are from his free mixtape . you can get his mixtape so far gone for free , online which ha 17 track and is a lot better . it ha good track flow , great production and basically professionally put together just be a mixtape . i have a feeling the record company released this ep to make some type of profit off of drake popularity .
0	this one is not good at all . used to be a fan of his but he is fallen . he is fallen far . it is a sad effort to be honest .
1	it is classic michael jackson ! how can you be anything le than thrilled at thriller ! it is just a great album at a great price ! it is time le and you can not go wrong with adding this little gem to your collection !
1	one of the most overlooked album in it is respective genre in the last 10 year
1	passion is the newest addition to an amazing collection of truly beautiful music . i have been a fan of george skaroulis ever since i stumbled upon him at a greek festival some year back . if you love great relaxing piano music along the line of george winston or jim brickman , you are in for a real treat . i have never been disappointed in this artist offering . listen to the track and find out for yourself , what you have been missing . and then get passion !
0	though , i will take some responsibility . i downloaded from itunes & should/could have listened to the sample . my bad . how can they use the same name a an already existing band ? and produce music like this while using that name ? really , it should be an outrage . i am stuck with stupid music that i paid for . oh well . i will just chalk it up to my own carelessness . hopefully it will not come up in random very often .
0	it would be nice if i could put this song on my player , but it is locked in the stupid cloud and i can not get to it . i am buying future song from itunes .
0	i wa very disappointed in the speed sleep product . it seemed to go on and on . the music wa very annoying . once you buy it you are stuck with it . it is nothing more than a relaxation session . just relax your body , think calm thought , and save your money .
0	suck !
1	love it !
0	henley is a lyrical and musical genius , but he dumbs it down to country on this release . i do not know if it is pandering or just plain laziness . at any rate it is a disappointment . the lyric are sophomoric and unrelated to the real world . musically it is either country waltz or three chord rockabilly . do not waste your money on this one .
1	carol of the bell is my favorite christmas song but with so many artist doing their own version of it i find it hard to pick a version that reminds me of my child hood . i think this version doe a very good job in that .
0	this is a big disappointment . this is just a awful a bionic . her voice is just nasty . i should have bought a holiday album instead of this .
0	this is not music , it is not anything but a bunch of people talking or having sex in the background with some flute or guitar barely heard in the background . wtf is wrong with you people for giving this cd a high rating . seriously , it is dumb . seriously folk , if you want to listen to a porn with no video , this is it . there is not any real music besides some light guitar or faint flute music . i can not believe this cd wa so highly rated . seriously dissappointed with the favoreable review , just unbelievable . you would have to be a moron to enjoy this .
0	would not let me play the song exception # 184 .
0	it is a sound track for the movie not the movie should be listed a the song from the movie zero dark thirty . but if they did that no one would buy it . frank bole
0	no plot synopsis or any information about the production included .
0	after download it wa fuzzy and distorted
1	excellent service and product . very satisfied .
0	to country
0	i am not a big a fan of king los a i am of los . when he wa doing mixtapes before becoming king , he wa the truth . this album is a let down .
1	great cd . this is the only cd i have found with so many great song on one disc . usually there are a couple good hit along with average or below average hit . from start to finish this cd will have you saying i have forgotten how great that song is . definitely recommend to any 70 music fan .
1	replacing old lp and cassette music with mp3 or cd . i like the mp3 option since many cd ( album ) only contain a couple keepworthy song .
1	my mom love this cd . i made her day .
0	first off i wan na address something prior to my review . east . 187 why would you say such a horrible thing calling 2pac wack . that is blasphemy right there . he wa a real a it get , he had quite a few positive song , and he wa one of the greatest ! anyone would agree with me there . on to my review of this cd . i weep at the current state of hip hop . how did we go from notorious big to lil flip ? hip hop ha taken a huge plunge in term of it lyrical prowess and it is pathetic . 50 cent doe not help one bit . yes yes congratulation mr curtis jackson on going multiple time platinum . but why did this album sell so much ? i think it wa based on the fact that he dissed ja rule and that he wa shot nine time and lived to tell . i mean anyone who say 50 is a lyrical beast is totally assinine . this guy is so predictable ! let u see , if he talk about selling rock he will probably mention something about glocks in the next few word . and if he mention hoe he will probably mention about him doing show . and if he mention . you get my point . he is such a bad lyricist . if he came outta the south i would understand but coming from queen ? ny is respected a the breeder of lyrical genius but 50 is trash . stop talking about how ( . ) ja rule is ! he beat u up and had u shot and stabbed ! you are the wanksta 50 cuz u never got back at him ! this album get it 2 star because the beat are hella good thanks to dre and eminem two of the best but this guy living off of his 9 shot story . i love how people gave him the name 5-0 and called 50 a snitch cuz it true . new title for this album get ( . ) or die cry
0	nothing new here , except the packaging . this collection is the first time inclusion of single from their recent lackluster album that is why god made the radio . the reason i highlight single is because , what the heck is a single these day ? although there wa actually a 45 rpm 7 vinyl single issued of that is why god made the radio , it wa just issued only for , probably , collector like me . the other new single , is not it time , only exists on the album . back in the day of top 40 radio , we called these album track , not single . included in this collection is yet another same old mono version of good vibration . come on guy , is not it time that a stereo mix officially come out ? most beach boy song were recorded on state of the art for those time , recording equipment . also included are several more should be stereo mono track : do it again , surfin safari , i get around , the little girl i once knew , help me , rhonda , fun , fun , fun , and of course , good vibration . unexplicably missing is their first hit surfin , plus many of their biggest hit like be true to your school and of course their holiday season hit . also included are some non-hit album track . listenning to the mono track , most sound like early cd , tinny and bassy , and are definitely not remixed . i do not think that brian would ever have okd these without at least re-eqing them . on the plus side , included are 7 black & white photo of the beach boy in their younger day , pre-gray , fat and bald . each disc come in it is own sleeve , disc 1 : their young day and disc 2 : the old fart . there is also a nice booklet ( which could easily fit in a jewel case ) . both cd look like mid-60s swirl label capitol 45s . the sound is great and doe offer many of their best song .
0	sorry . but , that is ridiculous ( my opinion ) .
0	the book think & grow rich is a must own . it is book to be read multiple time . that being said the particular reader of this audio book is very monotone . he doe not pause at the end of sentence or even a paragraph . you can hear the paah noise into the microphone every few second . the narrator ha a strong voice it is just emotionless . it reminded me of when a teacher would call on a student to read aloud . but the student is disinterested a try to blow through it a quickly and unenthusiastically a possible so he can go back to day dreaming . bottomline : buy the book , buy the audio book just skip this one .
1	i am in love with this : ) .
0	it is good
1	good quality but you have to download amazing music to have to song in you phone
1	for someone who is so strongly moved by the beauty of music , it melody and lyric a well a it arrangement and performance , i find this cd one of the most beautiful recording of all-time . once again and a always , the great nelson riddle showed off his trademark of excellence in orchestrating and conducting a dozen of ageless standard from the great american songbook . this cd will take u to a musical journey a we relish the timeless beauty of this sentimental music . with the superb instrumental skill of pianist don grolnick , drummer john guerin , bassist bob magnusson , guitarist bob mann ( who also played fabulously on rod stewart and steve tyrells recording ) and the creative flair of concertmaster david frisina , this cd offer some of the glowing moment of ms. ronstadts musical career . lush life , what is new ? and for sentimental reason are three of the greatest and most beautiful album of standard ever recorded . nobody sounded more expressive than ms. ronstadt singing when i fall in love , a song lamenting that love ha ended even before it ha begun . you can hear that beguiling guitar accompaniment by a fine guitarist , bob mann , complementing ms. ronstadts exquisite voice . likewise , nobody sounded so excruciatingly poignant with her moving rendition of when your lover ha gone . what lonely hour the evening shadow bring what lonely hour with memory lingering like faded flower life can not mean anything . . . in skylark , the singer made a mark on this song with her heartfelt rendition a she brings new life to this johnny mercer/hoagy carmichael classic . she also left a lasting impression to one of sinatra signature song i am a fool to want you , just like ol blue eye did with his meaningful interpretation . they both did the best version for male and female vocal , respectively . she swing lightly on rodgers & hart gem you took advantage of me , then she take it slower in mills/parish/ellingtons sophisticated lady . and pick up the light swing tempo again on can not we be friend ? sophisticated lady i know you miss the love you had long ago and when nobody is nigh you cry . . . you cry . if you are a lover of standard like me and an admirer of beauty in all it form , you should have this cd in your collection and take pleasure in listening to it endless beauty . here is to the magic of beautiful music !
0	love the opening track but after that it went steadily down hill , over indulgent and just plain dull in the most part , not a high point in an illustrious career .
0	to much vocal music and noise .
1	recording quality is not that great .
0	it is always good to see an artist change and try new thing . back in 2003 when jewel did , it wa a big deal . everyone accused her of selling out , which i think is unfair . this disc , while different , is just not what i would call jewel at her best . i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u wa also , but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me . i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd , goodbye , and i must say , it is jewel slowly regaining her musicality . also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next , it will fit her voice well .
1	there really is two separate thing to consider in reviewing this song . first , there is the music : the song is fairly simply , yet build in a mid-80s era bob dylan style . nothing spectacular but that really is not the point of the song . the production is clean , with all instrument clear yet allowing the focus to remain on the vocal , exactly where is should be . the primary focus of the song is in the lyric . wainwright paint a verbal picture of life on the road , and the desperate loneliness that walk hand in hand with it . while the lyric bring other groupie song to mind , such a what is your name , what really separate this is the lack of glamor in the road lifestyle and how the day after day life in motel room can drive a musician to despair . i think that at the beginning of the song , it is easy to dismiss it a another getting laid song , but on a closer listen you can hear the effect that road life ha on him , and how he is willing to say or do anything to not have to spend another night alone . really an accurate view of what the road can do to you , bringing to mind other real road classic such a turn the page and faithfully , but from an entirely different perspective . worth the download , but you have to listen to it a few time to really get it .
1	if you are reading this review , then you mustve been born recently , or stuck in some other time space continuum . i purchased this tape year ago when pete rock & c.l . smooth were new artist , and this song/album still bang now like it did then . i am just updating to digital .
0	do not have much to say about this a this wa something i had not even ordered . no real word for this at all .
0	song were different from what i heard on youtube
0	will not play on my android . ripoff ? !
0	well in short , not good at all , not my chemical romance style , if they felt like getting back to the basic at least go back to decent music like three cheer .
0	i thought my having just downed a hard cider wa making me hear this song in some distorted way , but after reading everyones review , i now see it is not me on a buzz . this song is just horrible . it is off-key , the vocalist can not carry a tune in a bucket , and is that the sound of cat fighting in the background ? a frank barone from everybody love raymond used to say , hooooly crap . thank god it is free and i could hit cancel on the download .
0	sounded like a mexican band ; not country ; not my style . every song sounded the same ; no variety . if you are looking for country , this is not for you .
0	there wa not enough info to convert file for play on win medium player . could not find file on my computer
1	another hit !
0	i wa counting down the day to this album being released . i listen to sturgills first two album often and could not wait for new stuff . so i buy the album on release day and start listening . what the heck is this ? ! ? ! the 1st track is ok , the nirvana cover is absolutely putrid , the rest of the album is just boring and generic . huge disappointment !
1	i bought this uk edition of their debut album because it had extra track including boyfriend featuring snoop dogg ! i liked it !
1	love this song ! it is very catchy and very cute . this whole album is such a wonderful find . my infant son and i really have enjoyed every song , but this is one of our top 3 !
0	i actually like instrumentals , but i assumed that the entire album would have more collaboration . also , all of the song did not download with the album . that wa the most disappointing . maybe next time .
0	the song is listed a keep on smiling but it not what you get when you download it . thats suck ! there is nothing i can do .
0	i have followed planetshakers for several year now and i own all of their album . i have never been a big fan of their songwriting . when compared to songwriter like daniel bashta , hillsong , brian johnson , david crowder , jeremy riddle and similar artist , p lyric always seem elementary . like very surface level . they just make word rhyme and repeat phrase rather than dig deep for word that convey real meaning . but what they lacked in songwriting , they always more than compensated for in musicianship . their song have been driven by ripping guitar and jammin drum . i have bought the album only for their edgy rock sound . with this new album , the blazing guitar and smooth drum fill are missing . they have gone to more of an electronic sound with a little lead guitar sprinkled in and boring 4-on-the-floor drum pattern . it sound more like what you would hear in a disco . very disappointing . i will not buy more p album if this is the direction they continue to take . for an example of the shallow lyric , here is the verse & chorus to the title track , limitless : i am saying goodbye to any limitation . i am saying hello to the god of all creation . there are no limit with you . there are no limit with you . you are limitless , nothing too hard for you . you are limitless , there is nothing you can not do . you are bigger , and you are greater and you are stronger i know . you are limitless , you are limitless . and that is it . sing the verse twice and the chorus 5 or 6 time .
1	bad as !
0	pre ordered it and when the album wa released i only got 4 song in stead of all of them on the album release date
0	not really the song . generic . so disappointing in this purchase
0	this composition , while ambitious and promising at certain point , never really take off . the composer relies too heavily on a rapid ostinato of many percussion instrument , but doe not go anywhere with it . the theme never develop , and the variation are not all that different from each other . i had high hope for the coda a it seemed that the piece wa building to a satisfying conclusion , but it wa just more of the same . i do detect some possibility that his future work may go in some new direction , however .
0	100 % trash with disgusting text and poor music .
1	my second favorite r & b album of the year , right behind anti from riri . this wa a grower at first but it is bumpin loud around the house now . it wa hard to get into the rest of the album cuz all i kept playing wa welcome to my world ! { we in this bitch } hold on ! { another great hip hop an r & b tracc for u best of me fan } an elevator . the rest of the album is great like team you ! coolin ! & smoove jones afta glow show ! { outro } but one man woman is weak .
1	love it ! jill at her best .
0	i know most of the review here are from people that know danny or listen to him producing an am talk show and have a certain affinity for him . their review seem a little biased at best . the truth is that while this album definitely call back to old country music , it doe so in the most generic way possible . nothing here is really worth listening to more than once , and really once you have gotten to the chorus of each song you have pretty much heard all of it . no fresh or exciting take here , just monotonous studio music laid out in a completely predictive pattern . dannys voice doe not help matter much . it is not strong enough to be a lead so the generic music really overpowers it . it is too bad actually , if he had a stronger voice this could at least be classified a your basic generic old country music album . a such it fall short of even that . if you know ( of ) danny and want to get this for nostalgic reason then by all mean go for it . if you do not know danny but have always wondered what it would sound like to record a karoke album then this is for you . all others would be better served looking up marty robbins , george jones or hank williams to get the real deal .
0	i enjoyed it more when i wa a 16 year old hippie . audio quality wa good . i forgot the rant about god though and that wa enough for me to delete it .
1	promise made on signal mountain ha to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this entire cd is so calming ; i can not explain the sense of peace that come over me when i listen to it . if you are looking for something relaxing and uplifting , i would highly recommend it !
0	i wa big tyme disappointed by this album . bluntly speaking , it is a major deviation from the stylistic sound that characterize single western way or killing time , or waisters and melted on the blunted cd . if you like the creamed over jazzy trip hop track of the other single , then stop searching for this cd right now . this cd is straight commercial and the style is done already . if you want to hear the sound on this cd in a better presentation you would be better served to pick up some old soul ii soul . i heard killing time on a community channel on cable . it wa being broadcast by a radio station . this song by itself , put me on the trail of trip hop . a journey that took me through massive attack , portished , craig armstrong , tricky , and others to arrive at a full cd by coco and the bean that is just a huge let down . seriously disappointed with the current direction .
0	wrong cd in case . case cracked . high price .
0	paid for it but never downloaded
1	meek mill traumatized hit too close to home a i have recently lost my mother and took over her position . polo and shell top also meant a lot to me .
1	once again , micheal castaldo ha brought his phenomenal talent to the forefront with his latest rendition of prayr . micheals rich , soulful voice always touch the heart and soul of the listener , and prayr is no exception . this song , done in both italian and english , prof once again , that beautiful music is beautiful music in any language . micheals interpretation and performance of this song is extraordinary and i truly hope it receives the airplay that it so deserves . if you have not yet purchased prayr . do not wait any longer . it is destined to be a mega-hit !
0	i bought this for my 8 month old and she is not impressed by it at all . she much rather listens to the radio . guess i could have saved the money
1	screechy , and eerie , this song is totally transformed yet strangely familiar .
0	major disappointment . always been a huge bh fan from way back . the songwriting is trite and uninspired . take no chance musically . dont get me started on the ridiculous political statement he is trying to make with the title track . utterly forgettable album .
0	i like other song by her better , this song is okay , but she ha done a lot better on her other song .
1	since i grew up in an extremely remote part of alaska , i may be one of the few people on the planet who wasnt very exposed to the bee gee music in the seventy . i wa only familiar with lonely night from a mix album of my parent and i had no idea who the artist were . in my twenty i ventured out into the world and heard stayin alive and other disco hit without really paying much attention . in my thirty i had dinner at my parent house and afterwards they watched an a & e special concert promoting the bee gee album , this is where i came in . naturally , i stayed to watch . and almost immediately i wa blown away by the most unique , amazing and thrilling voice i would ever heard in my life . from that moment on i bought every bee gee album available simply and solely to expose myself to robin gibbs voice . and what a rewarding journey that was- his range never failed to delight and lead me on to the next album to see what else he would do with the incredible instrument that wa his voice . obviously , the huge album from the seventy did not interest me much , despite their genius danceability , because his voice is not highlighted . fortunately i managed to get hold of his solo album . i have often wondered what robin gibb would have done with his voice if he had not been shaped by the bee gee . often i yearned for something more than the pop song . after all , his voice could easily have embraced any style or genre . this album come the closest to proving that . just listen to do not cry alone if you do not believe me . and while many of the track are once again pop , they are more mature , both in lyric and in vocal . and i love that he us his terrific range from one song to the next . i especially love it when he sings in the lower register ( sanctuary ) , since he doe it so rarely- but so well . naturally , if you love robin gibb or the bee gee you are going to buy this album . if you are simply a music lover you owe it to yourself to expose yourself to one of- if not the- most unique , haunting and penetrating voice in popular music history . this album is a wonderful introduction to the joy that is robin gibbs voice .
0	this particular sky record digital album is being sold without jarboes approval . do not support this particular download .
1	love this cd .
1	great song , heard him sing it on american idol and had to have it , i like the acoustic version just a well a the other .
0	you will love it if you like transsexual rapping .
1	i love folk acoustic guitar music and have listend to many artist . came across this song by robin bullock quite by accident on youtube . wa completely blown away . listened to it about 10 time before i could walk away from my computer . wish robin lived in the u so that i could have more chance of seeing him in concert .
1	great to listen to . for my daughter and the lesson through life . also smash mouth get knocked down but i get back up again !
0	like other piece by merry this wa not one . very short a little over a minute . buyer should be notified . have never seen such a short rendition and be charged more like a sample .
0	it downloaded twice . i called for credit . they told me they had issued the credit but when i went to use my account again i notice i had not been issued the credit for this item .
0	this is his worse album every . the lyric suck and his beat suck . he claim to be the best but he is not . the worse song are theee forth of the disk . he should have took time and dud this disk right
0	no good
0	great song written and song originally by cheryl wheeler who can sing .
0	where is the woodwind obbligato ? the break strain ? and what is with the stinger ? ! this is not the real go u !
1	i remember when the four top were popular and i still love them today . soon my oldie favorite list will be at 150 !
1	nice mix of song .
1	this is one of those perfect single it is so simple but , so close to flawless dave gahan vocal even the 1980s synth keyboard sound all work to create a flawless single that still to this day stand the test of time ! a must all around 10/10
1	the cd got to pr in no time , it wa in great condition and it wa overall perfect since i love manson and his new album
0	this is b , the purpous of digital music is to choose what song you want and not forced to buy an entire album .
1	good price
1	heard it in a movie , and wanted it . it wa hard to find online , but amazon had it for a cheap price , very happy with this track .
1	love it , love it , and really really love it ! yeah a 40 something year old like ke $ ha - part of me is embarrassed , and part of me is psyched ! ke $ ha is awesome !
1	great song , great copy , sound great . i will be downloading a lot more song from amazon very soon . loved it !
1	love his music
0	this cd set is okay but get a little monotonous after a while . i wa hoping it would be better but it is okay .
0	this version suck ! i accidentally ordered it instead of damien rice . i am pissed at wasting $ 1.29 . no cancelling i guess .
0	not a good listening song for the holiday . voice is too rough .
1	good vibration .
0	not listenable . you are better off just donating to get nothing in return .
0	i purchased this song along with 4 other song and all but this one completed the download . i tried to cancel this song order , but could not . therefore i paid for this song that did not download . no way to try a second time without paying for the song again and taking the chance it will not download again . oh well .
1	this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best song on this soundtrack are all of them . if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
0	ok
0	gift
0	but this album is horrible , only one fairly decent song on the entire cd.do not buy it you are wasting your hard earn money on this .
0	the title of this cd is actually strumming to the wilburys . there wa a recent press release about cheap trick , sean lennon and others doing a wilburys tribute album . this is not it ! this is one guy and his guitar covering 11 wilburys song . the guy is uncredited . in fact , everybodys uncredited . there are no liner note , no credit for the guy singing or the guitarist ( which i am guessing are the same person ) . no songwriter credit . not even a record label name , just a list of the song ( and not in the order that they are on the cd ) . i am not sure how legit this package is . his voice and guitar playing are passable . he kind of sound like a higher-register steve earle . his interpretation seem to miss the point of the original . by slowing down cool dry place to a serious dirge , he obliterates the intended goofy fun . the same go for dirty world . the wilburys hallmark wa an easygoing humor . that is completely missing . he doe not miss altogether . handle with care make it a a slower-tempo ballad and he manages to keep the rockabilly flavor of rattled without benefit of drum or electric guitar . hey , if this guy were playing in a bar and tossed in a couple of wilbury tune , i would think he rocked , but a whole record of this one guy is murder , and his anonymity ( not even a wilbury codename ) , make it a bogus enterprise . i would label this ` for completists only , but i am a wilburys completist , and this is $ 11.99 i wish i could get back .
1	superb !
0	do not expect too much . however , she wa somewhat better than others i have heard . wa okay , but disappointing . so-so client
0	lost is right , this disc being the covermount ( not for resale ) disc from classic rock magazine issue 103 , march 2007. it purport to be a collection of tune that have been lost in time , overlooked gem and curio that might be of interest to hard rock fan . ummm . well part of that plan ha been achieved . they are certainly curio . curio from the realm of apathy generation . because that is what you will probably feel when listening to these track . sure , tucky buzzard has/had some reason to exist and a few of these track might pique the interest of the occasional aficionado but much of it is so eclectic it is hard to see anybody listening to these number and thinking to themselves ` hey , i got ta get me some more tune by the aynsley dunbar retaliation . and i do not will not to dis this sampler even though that is what i am doing . it is just that people into these band probably have every darn thing they ever put to vinyl . and nothing here is likely to convert the not already converted , if you get my drift . anyway , i played this once and that wa a chore .
1	great song
0	this is cute but very small . do not think it is worth the price . it is very soft . doe not seem to keep kid intrigued
0	i never seen so many of her video ( like die young ) that ha nothing but anti-christ and illuminati symbolism in them . i thought lady ga ga and mondana wa bad . if you do not catch it then your being programmed .
0	alright , this song is actually so horrible that i could not help myself from writing a review . it consists of minimal beat on an mpc that a 5 year old most likely did . the most annoying part of the song is the repeated you do not know ! that play over and over again to imply the listener did not hear it the first 3 time . the final you do not know ! end with a horrible pitch shift downward due to a very inexperienced singer . do not throw away your money , and if it is on the radio change the station !
0	this is not the rengades . i am very disappointed . it seems that all the renegade mp3 downloads have the original title but are not the song belonging to that title .
0	this review is directed at the vendor a opposed to the actual album . do not buy from new chapter recycling , this record shipped in a plain white cover ( and damaged at that ! ) instead of the original cover a seen in the pic . ridiculous , sending back and ordering from another vendor .
1	great cd by one of the top band around today .
1	this cd will have you moving to beat . all of the song are great and the production is top quality !
0	showed item to artist and wa told it wa fake . checked artist copy and it is completely different
0	the cd did not play . i purchased volume 1 and volume 2 but volume 2 doe not play and the paper and receipt were not saved . highly disappointed .
0	the first and only album i have not liked from floyd since final cut
1	good oldie classic rock song from the 80
0	i am so sad that this record is very bad . i love metallica and wa excited to add this my my vinyl collection of mostly classic rock . however , you can tell that this wa a cheaply pressed record . my old record have a very full sound eventhough they are 20yr old , but a soon a you play this one you can notice that the sound doe not have any level . it is like the speaker wa blown , very very bad to the point of me not being able to enjoy the music . oh well , that is what i get for paying only $ 10+ for a vinyl
0	i am certainly no prude and i like noisy music . i also find toilet humor funny like most men . however , i find this cd completely pointless and tedious . it is not at all funny , and there is little to no musical merit or melody to be found . every track of this excrutiatingly long cd is essentially the same - a guy screaming lyric in a strong french accent that sound a if they were written by a 14-year-old over unclassifiable , unprofessionally produced music which seems to be there only incidentally . i suppose some folk would know that a cd with a penis on the cover and a title like lung fart would not be their cup of tea , but for those ( like me ) who think these would be selling point , trust me , they aint .
0	just ok
1	great
0	not worth the purchase .
0	this is not the song i wanted , and i do not know how to download it . i miss the old day , when you bought a song and then you actually owned it . how can i embed this in a powerpoint ? how could i use it in a photo slideshow ? grrr . im hopelessly left behind by technology and im only 33
1	the best cd i have ever had
1	it is always disappointing hearing people saying , i wanted pretty hate machine - part ii , and the such . anybody who ha followed trent reznors music career should know to expect something different with everything he release . you will never get a part ii to any nin album , because , from the beginning , trent reznor set out to do one thing : innovate . rehashing old album would be counter intuitive to his innovative nature . ghost , however , pushing trent reznor to his creative edge . the mission : to create an instrumental soundscape , rather than an album reliant on verse-chorus-bridge structure . the mission wa , indeed , successful . ghost present beautiful piano passage , soothing swarm of saturated noise , and harsh , electronic beat . a perfect recipe to form the soundtrack to daydream , which is how he describes ghost . the song are , to their core , trent reznor , without rehashing , recycling , or regurgitating his past effort , making this album a true step forward in the nin legacy .
0	terrible sound quality ! i bought the vinyl and i barely even recognized the song because it wa so warped . dont buy the vinyl version . even worse , i missed the return date . i am stuck with it .
1	excellent album by christopher cross . i bought extra copy for friend .
1	he is my favorite
1	for lover of david arkenstone and others on the windham hill label , this album is a keeper . very relaxing and peaceful , while not putting you to sleep . i love to work late at night and this music is great for that .
0	i bought this song , hoping that this version also included the verse a well a the refrain . sadly , it is only the refrain . my mom used to sing this song around the house , and i had searched for a long time for a recording ( with word ) . the listen ability on amazon only give a bit of the refrain , but i purchased it anyway with great hope . ok , it wa only 99 cent , so no harm done . but , it would have been nice to have heard the tune of the verse . i found the word in a museum in valdes , alaska a few year back ; found the verse again online at a lyric website , so i know a verse exists .
1	enjoying listening to mark chesnutt on cassette especially bubba shot the jukebox , since that is what i call my new nissan juke , my jukebox . i wa ruining my cd so i have been playing cassesttes while i wash and wax my jukebox .
0	i wanted the song so bad that i also ordered the re-mix but did not know that it wa the album . i don ; t have a turntable to play it on . i have no use for it .
0	love the goat , but this song . well , seems they used so much creative energy in coming up with the title they had little left for the actual song .
0	i cant believe she had the nerve to sing this song ! she doesnt have the style to do so ! i feel the same way about her other remake ! [ . ] ! thalia sure is very pretty but lack so much in talent. , not the best of voice and not the best dancer. , i went to dead or alives concert in san francisco nobody in this planet could sing you spin me round a pete burn doe !
0	this guy is not funny . he is mean spirited and intolerant . i hated it . i am sorry i spent my money on it .
1	the song is catchy and fun . amy winehouse wa a very talented singer and her vocal work very well with the lyric of the song .
0	it is a cd , wooh .
1	really love this song . it wa used in the movie trailer for the secret life of walter mitty and the song is pretty addictive to listen to .
1	this song give me so much inspiration whenever i need it . yolanda adam is one of the most talented and blessed gospel artist today .
0	i love the album , but skip this loud , over-the-top , obnoxiously sung song every time . it is definitely something bad . bad for my ear .
1	love this song !
0	not quite what i expected
1	absolutely love it . one of my favorite song at the moment .
0	for a while it seemed that taylor swift could do no wrong . even those who were not swayed by her honest-to-heels girliness have to admit that she creates captivating popular song , with each album outshining the last one . swift would even prove her doubter who would claim that third time is rarely the charm false when she came up with her best-to-date album speak now , which , like fearless , is laced with big-girl wisdom that anyone can nod his/her head to . but this time around it seems that she ha finally gone out of fuel . her latest album , boldly named red , is an abysmal effort at best , creating a vast change of style that surrendered to the mainstream bubble-gum pop princess pop , with an infantile attitude and horrendously little-girly lyric . those of u who are curious and hopeful of how swift will grow a an artist will be terribly disappointed : swift ha not grown with her 4th album but shrank , or more explicitly , aging backwards ; her song are now for 13-year-old girl ( or younger ) and anyone else who is willing to throw up her hand and say awww how cute ! the trouble immediately started with her first single we are never ever getting back together . the title of the song is already bad enough , but one must give taylor swift the benefit of the doubt , after all , one of the song on her last ( deluxe ) album is called if this wa a movie and it turned out to be a beautiful , heart-felt song ( and one of my favorite from her ) . this time however , luck ha ran out ; it wa even worse than i couldve ever imagined . how bad ? well , let u just say that it is only remotely better than rebecca black viral friday , but unlike rebecca black , she can not plead lack of experience or young age . it is a song that is entirely devoid of any poetic element and consist of simply girly talk . at one point she even croons : i say , ` i hate you , we break up , you call me , ` i love you . an accurate parody of the song can be thus : oh so i told you the other day , i called him up , and he wa like : ` can we make up ? and i wa like : ` no way and he wa like ` please and we ended up in like , this restaurant , and then he said something that i did not like , so i wa like : we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together again . and he wa like ` whaaaat ? and i wa like yep . i have no doubt that this song ha the potential to sell very well . after all , just how many time can one over-estimate the american audience anyways ? the phrasing of most of the rest of her song are the worst i have heard of taylor swift so far . the album is entirely filled of nauseating bleep like re-e-e-e-e-d and me-e-e-e-e-e that went along her usual chick-self-victimizing lyric that , unlike the last couple of album , lacked any kind of depth or insight that can appeal to a mature brain , thus they are no longer charming but annoyingly ego-centric that can be characterized a those that came from the mouth of a popular and pouty teenage cheerleader . while any song on red that actually sound tad-bit more mature consist of boring tune that fell out of any grace that taylor swift had with her past strong ballade such a dear john or back to december . even worse move wa to invite other ( male ) singer to collaborate song with her . normally we listen to swift album and because it is recorded in a studio , we forget the fact that swift is very weak vocally , but now , with other singer , the difference is painfully acknowledged . especially the last time in which she sang with gary lightbody of snow patrol . lightbody essentially owned the song , out-reflect swift squeaking like she is a timid sing-along audience in the background . there ha always been argument of swift genre : whether she can be considered country or just pop . and it did not matter because she wa good at what she doe . but now , with this album , who can really say that she is still country ? her album is not even good pop . perhaps she should think twice before working with a bunch of song-writers for bubble-gum pop and return to do everything by herself , or work with better musician ( her best new song ha been safe and sound with civil war , many people who heard that song doubted that swift had any major writing , and they are justified in their skepticism-she is clearly not on that level yet ) a word of advice for taylor swift is that before she doe , she should slow down and take a good look around her . being ego-centric and aggressively victimizing oneself may have their charm for a while , but too much of something is rarely a good thing . because the truth of matter is , the world is composed of much bigger thing than her .
1	this is a great cd . i saw gloria bill in concert in cadiz , ky back in october . i bought their cd and could not stop listening to it . always sometimes is one of my favorite song now . oh yeah , and the sister of the lead singer work at sonic here in cadiz . funny , huh ? mmmmmmm . cheeseburger .
0	it wa not the full dvd that i expected . very disappointed .
1	reminiscent of jack nicholsons line in the 1997 film a good a it get , you make me wan na be a better man , this song embodies what a woman want in a relationship . from the opening note , you will be sucked into the melody and simple lyric that comprise wan na make you love me and will be left humming the tune all day . although this song is not written by gibson himself , it doe expose music lover to his rich vocal that tickle your ear drum . stay tuned for gibson next single ( written by gibson himself ) summer back set to be released this month .
1	one of mary well best . no problem with download .
0	beyond stupid . even more stupid and irritating than actually having 2 phone
1	this cd is so relaxing when i am drifting off to sleep . rain is my favorite nature sound , so you can imagine how often i use this cd . the sound quality is exceptional . i could not be happier !
1	love casting crown . their song always speak to my heart . always uplifting . one of their best song yet . like to hear more
1	yes , music is soothing and pleadsnt
1	this is without a doubt one of the classiest , most beautiful cd i have in my collection . buy it without hesitation . indescribably beautiful , intelligent , warm and well produced .
0	i had pre-oredered this album on itunes , and could not wait to get it . i first fell in love with bright eye when i heard their album i am wide awake , it is morning . the gentle , yet strong instrument and focus on vocal had a large calming effect on me , which is why i grew to love bright eye . however , this album denies the acoustic glory that said bright eye album delivered . most of the song rely heavily on electric instrument and a distorted sound that come off a angry instead of thought provoking . i would not recommend this to anyone .
1	nice to be able to download an old single song that trigger old memory instead of buying an entire album .
1	although gretchen is a self-proclaimed redneck woman , this christmas collection is actually a nice blend of country twang and tranditional production . the christmas song for example , is rich with jazzy piano and quite the vocal showcase . i want a hippopotamus for christmas is the best song on the album and the only notable cover of the classic song . it is beautifully honky tonk while still being faithful to the original . santa i have been naughty is a great original track and definitely a highlight . have yourself a merry little christmas is another vocal spotlight and quite charming . it is one of my personal favorite . the others are good too . in fact , the only dud go to nuttin for christmas which is about 98 % annoying and 2 % cute . overall : although i love country music from time to time , sometimes mixing the genre with traditional christmas carol can be a bad move . fortunally the production here maintain a solid sense of classic holiday atmosphere , with just the right touch of signature gretchen . her vocal shine throughout many of the track and her irresistible attitude make an appearance a well . i give it a solid recommendation !
0	still trying to find out how i ordered this mp3 song i hat the way amazon music tried to take over my computer and start up this program every time i booted up . had to uninstall it from my computer . bad experience and product .
0	wow . this album is awful . i have been a fan of crooked i since the death rizzo day . royce too since the late 90 . budden is a great lyricist . joell is dope . he ha been one of my favorite rapper the last couple of year . the first album wa really good . some filler on it . it wa recorded in 6 day . ( they took 2 year on this album . ) most of the song released on the internet before the first album dropped were great . so many quotables . green lantern freestyle wa sick ! the mastering on this album suck . period . i am listening on a rega system . where is the production from the alchemist ? they sounded great over just blaze production on the song with em . they are trying to get into the mainstream but the beat selection on this album is just silly . they pick the worst beat from these producer . yes these guy can rhyme . why can not they make good song ? ( unless they are rapping over someone el beat . ) the single were weak but i expected that . guest feature from cee-lo , ( singing that awful hook ) busta , skyler grey , ( never heard of her ) bob , swizz , and em . wtf i blame eminem , jimmy iovine , and interscope record . yes these guy deserve success but not with this album . knick knack paddy wack how i wan na bone cmon joell . these reviewer are saying they are bringing back lyric . i am going to listen to the hip hop weekly series , mood muzik , the bar exam and pretend our house never came out . and to that first review . killer mike r.a.p . music is the album of the year so far .
1	remembered this song from year ago and am very glad to have found it again .
0	t.c . elli had a brief part in prince graffiti bridge ( the album and the movie ) . his delivery wa excellent , so i wa truly looking forward to his solo debut . unfortunately true confession fell short of the mark . the first single miss thang wa good . good enough to prompt me to buy the album after getting the cassingle ( anyone else remember cassette single ? ) the rest of the album wa mediocre . t.c . elli had a fast-paced & flowing rapping style on graffiti bridge that wa - lamentably - replaced with a slow & choppy style on most of true confession . it is possible that they tried to emulate the success of tone locs wild thang , which explains the 2 song ; miss thang and cold thang . however , even with decent sample and beat , the rapping utlimately came across a amateurish . a good example is the track pussycat which sample george clinton atomic dog ( and list the godfather of funk a producer ) ; excellent beat and nice hook - but the delivery by t.c . wa anything but funky . the title track wa an extension of t.c.s rap on graffiti bridge and is probably the strongest track on the album . not enough to save the album however .
0	not the one i wa looking for
0	blase and uninspired , sadly , a wa most of his music from this album .
1	great sound
1	great !
1	the history of this song is very intense if you listen to the lyric . also the singing voice are very well in tune .
1	help to soothe and focus me
0	most of the music start out okay but then in the middle it get loud and take on a jazzy type sound which doe not do well to relax a person who is trying to sleep . of course the sample that are given do not let you know that . worst 1.99 i have spent . may not seem like a lot to amazon but for me it wa like throwing it out the window . amazon can do that with it is own money . i will not purchase another music from them .
1	digital download wa smooth .
0	ok , so it ultra new age and designed for meditation , etc . it still doe not work for me but that may be just personal .
0	i am so disgusted with amazon this season . 1/3 of the christmas are offensive , explicit , and revolting , and it is not even a week into december . i saw that it wa lady gaga , so i wa wary at first , but i decided to give the preview a chance . light me up and put me on top ? really amazon , really ? christmas spirit includes carol , wintery atmosphere , giving , etc . not sexual innuendo . so disappointing , esp . after the first great song by casting crown .
1	i am not a parent ( but i play one on tv ? ; ) , but i used to be a nanny . my 2-3yr old twin obsessed over hi-5 , and i have to say , some of their tune were pretty darn catchy . i downloaded the song i personally enjoyed more ( you know , the one that got stuck in * my * head all day long , that i could sing along with the show a though i would written them myself ? hah ) to make a collection cd out of them , this being one of those song ; i admit , i really did not mind ( too much ) having to listen to them every.single.time we got in the car and went somewhere . if i am going to be forced to listen to something over and over on a daily basis , there are far worse thing it could be . if you have got young kid , give this song a whirl .
1	this come from one of the more obscure gerge harrison album but will always be one of my favorite song !
0	there were only a few song i liked . not what i expected .
1	great tribute to richard wright .
0	i listened to the preview and i find it kind of annoying that this is even listed with all of these musical piece .
1	awesome
0	i understand this song is supposed to be all political and deep and whatnot , but her voice and the sound of this song altogether make me want to stick a screwdriver into my eardrum so that i never have to listen to one second of this song ever again for a long a i live . i am very diverse in my music taste but i hate this song , i really think this is the worst song ever to be released in the history of time .
1	this cd is hilarious , i admit there are some song that are not really funny , but there always 1 or 2 bad song on an album ( in this one , the 1 bad track is it happened in sun valley that wa a really bad song ) . also if you are easily offended by swearing , raciest remark ( do not worry it always in the interest of humor and always is funny ) so if you are so devoted to you religion that you would defend it in any way then do not buy this . but if you like south park or are getting sick of the normal christmas song then buy this album
0	sound like it wa recorded during tuesday night music club ( i know it wasnt ) and that is not my favorite era of hers . sound sorta been-there-done-that . hope the rest of the detour cd is better .
1	this song is one of those song that you listen to when you are looking for a healing and deliverance from self .
1	great song
1	this is not the princess music you would likely expect , it is better than that . it is world guitar music . it is very similar to a world music cd we have been using when putting out baby to sleep . this wa a good addition to change thing up a bit while still being soothing and calm . i did not give it 5 star because there are a few song where the guitar chord are sharp and a bit startling . this is fine to listen to when you are awake , but are not a soothing a i wouldve liked for falling asleep . i skip those song , the others are great . i loved the price on this , and it wa definitely worth it !
0	the orchestral piece have a lot of white noise in the background and many song cut off half way through .
0	the cd wa just okay . i am from chicago and i love house music but this wa kinda lame . a lot of the song sound alike but the bass is booming ! i am a dancer and i can only use about 3 of the 12 track . i am glad it did not cost a lot .
0	do not . it doe not have vocal track in the mix . it is a straight-up repeating beat . when i previewed it , i thought maybe there were no vocal because it wa possibly too vulgar or they picked a weird place to put the sample . after all , it list all of the rapper in the artist column . wrong . wrong . i just spent a buck on half of this song . thanks a ton , whomever came up with this idea .
0	junk . the cd came without a case and wa broken . who would buy a cd without a case . who would & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/embers/dp/b003ntk4e2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > ember < /a > & nbsp ; sell a cd without a case .
0	i am sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great band like killswitch engage , in flame , a i lay dying , lamb of god , ect . now thats real music . not this crap . the only reason this guy even popular is because he got shot nine time . in a few year rap will die just like disco . then metal will rule the world once again .
1	our first dance a husband and wife wa to this song . i hope we are dancing to it for year to come .
0	paul taylor music is not the same a when i bought his earlier cd . the music is not a great a it wa before .
1	really really good !
0	i pre ordered this record , so you can imagine the amount of excitement i had when it arrived . i wa all but kissed the delivery man when it came ! i ran straight up to my record machine and played it , probably around 3 time before giving poor dierks a break . i listened to the record about 5 time after that before the unthinkable happened . it is different for girl began to skip ! i wa in shamble ! on my fourth time of playing one of my favorite record it wa skipping ! now i am not some record abuser and throw my record around no no no ! i have a special place where all my record are held and placed ever so neatly back into the slip and folder . and my needle is changed quite regularly , so nothing on my part could it have gone wrong . so when it began to skip you could imagine my horror , i have 20 year old record that are still playing me some good ole country without any skipping or anything ! i honestly can say the quality of this record is so horrible it completely ruined my experience with this record and let me tell you i am a hugeeeee fan of dierks , it wa a tragedy . you will never hear me say this ever again in my life but for this record it is better to litsen to it on your phone .
0	while , at 99 cent , the collection is quite cheap and feature some fine performance , buyer should be aware that the highly regarded performance of the messiah by the bach collegium japan is butchered rather badly : it is drastically ( and clumsily cut ) . we get the soprano recitative there were shepherd abiding in the field , but not the marvelous aria that follows . and his yoke is easy , his burden is light , along with he shall feed his flock is also missing . i would have gladly given up a few of the other 111 amazing track in order to get a messiah that wasnt edited in such a clumsy fashion . this seems like a performance worth getting to know , but those who purchase this collection will be missing quite a bit . ( a helpful commentator on this review pointed out the the entire bach collegium japan messiah is available in & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/111-amazing-classical-handel/dp/b00g7kbsb2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > 111 amazing classical : handel < /a >
1	i have got to admit , i have had this cd since it first came out . i am just writing a review now , better late than never . i give the cd is 5 star . yes it is a mellow cd , but it is awesome . just like paul stanley 1978 kiss solo cd , ( my personal favorite ) wa the most mellow of the four , his song i feel were the stongest . just like that cd his live to win cd may be mellow but the song , the vocal and the playing is top notch . paul is a master craftsman of song . he always writes the best music , then put his songcrafting ability to it . definatly a 5 star cd . this is paul stanley at his best . rock on .
0	downloaded just fine . not sure what else to say about an mp3 purchase other than i did not like the song and it work just fine .
1	beautifully sung by howard shore ! a great buy .
1	i have listened to this album since i wa a kid and each time it take me back . forget the ethnic theme of the album and just listen to the music . i love that it take ancient song we all know and love and put pure soul into them . my favorite track are the overture , every valley , lift up your head , and he shall purify and of course halleujah . all i can say is this album is nostalgic for me and reminds me why i love christmas and the holiday season .
0	this is some sort techno version like the first reviewer said . the only place that ha the original seems to be rhapisody under some hit of 80 cd . it sound a little thin to me but it the right version at least .
1	great song
1	i will always love 3 door down !
0	i do not understand why adam want to so over process that beautiful voice like all of the talentless hack in the pop scene today . he is a cut above in the vocal department - he doe not need to do this . i am not a fan of his song selection and the direction he is gone in his career , with his focus on such a heavy pop sound instead of rock , where he shine , in my opinion . but , i adore him and his fearlessness . he is obviously doing what he love and just because it doe not resonate with me doe not mean it is not worthwhile . i just wish he would do more ballad , song with deeper lyric and let u hear raw adam in all it natural beauty .
0	i love dyan . this cd came a a shock . slow , boring , uninspired , dreadful . update , i listened to it again . it is even worse than i thought . his singing is like a parody ; it is amateurish ; he would be laughed off the stage at american idol . horrible ! i can not believe he released this .
0	did not sound a good a it did in bourne identity !
0	where did all the powerful and emotion filled lyric go ? while the music may have at least attempted to go back to from here to infirmary it is stopped dead by skibas voice and lyric , such a on draculina and the american scream . his raw passionate word have turned into this terrible attempt at clean vocal and now song just seem awkward when he decides to throw the f word into them ( eating me alive ) . dan manages to save some of the album with off the map and fine , but once again , they lyric are sub par . do not get me wrong , i do not hate the trio , they are my favorite band , but they could do so much better than this . i wanted to like it , and went into it with an open mind , but after a few listens , nothing stuck out , and i did not even feel the need to listen to it ever again . if you really want a good alkaline trio record go pick up & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/good-mourning/dp/b00008yjda/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > good mourning < /a > & nbsp ; and anything before it . if you have listened to this one and like it , go try out & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/from-here-to-infirmary/dp/b00005b2xu/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > from here to infirmary < /a > & nbsp ; or & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/goddamnit/dp/b0012gm69y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > goddamnit < /a > & nbsp ; i promise they are so much better .
0	let me break this down , in a rather incomplex fashion , for all who are either considering the purchase of this cd or just reading the review to gripe and moan . nirvana , while rebellious , offered nothing new , or even creative to the musical landscape of this or any other era . i understand , and even empathize with all the tortured soul out there , but cobain did not speak to you . in fact , he loathed you , a he did all of his loyal fan . that is the catch twenty two with an anti-everything group such a nirvana . in following them , you are actually defying all that they stand ( or stood ) for , and thus become the antithesis of their idealistic contemporary or true fan . in fact , by worshipping nirvana , you actually become the very enemy that cobain sought to destroy . learn this , and accept it . secondly , the music ( please , stop pleading otherwise ) wa diluted , poorly constructed and almost completely lacked any semblence of complexity or beauty . his lyric were not poetic , or abstract , or other-wordly , they were simply the lyric of a disgruntled and nihilistic elitist . i also seriously should not need to call any attention to the complete lack of adeptness or training with which cobain attempted to play the guitar . let u simply say that his ability on guitar wa le than passing . in addition , the rest of the band member were also hardly virtuoso . so , you can cease in claiming that a well . thirdly , an album greatness depends solely on it ability to persevere . the longevity of an album ( inspect this postulate , it show in what we now consider to be classic ) is also completely dependent on the diversity of sound and style which the album employ . time ha repeatedly shown this . and , needle to say , nevermind , and all other nirvana album for that matter , are about a diverse sonically a a ceiling fan . that is three strike nirvana fan . yep , ( 0-3 ) . so . i will leave you with a sagacious word ( advice , if you will ) regarding a better musical path which it is not too late to pursue . for the love of god ( if one exists ) heed my call , the world will experience a profound change for the better if you do . if you are planning on picking up , or playing , or praising , a nirvana cd , and are doing so because : 1. you despise society , and all that the archetypal american stand for , then you should listen to these album instead : the velvet underground - the vu and nico or white light/white heat the mother of invention - freak out ! or we are only in it for the money the fug - the fug elliott smith - elliot smith or xo radiohead - amnesiac , kid a , ok computer , the bend or hail to the thief 2. you have a mild aversion to consumerism and/or love poignant , heartfelt lyric , then pick up these album instead : leonard cohen - song of leonard cohen or song of love and hate wilco - summerteeth or yankee hotel foxtrot bob dylan - highway 61 revisisted , freewheelin , the time they are a-changin blonde on blonde , another side of bob dylan , or bringin it all back home billy bragg - william bloke or talking with the taxman about poetry nick drake - pink moon or five leaf left the beatles - sgt . pepper , revolver , abbey road , white album , rubber soul etc . yo la tengo - i can hear the heart beating a one or and then nothing turned itself inside out 3. you love heavy rock music and feeling angsty or contemplative , or love gruff or non-traditional sounding vocal , then you should listen to these album instead : television - marquee moon the flaming lip - zaireeka , yoshimi battle the pink robot or the soft bulletin captain beefheart - safe a milk , lick my decal off baby or trout mask replica billie holiday - lady in satin or song for distingue lover van morrison - astral week the pixy - surfer rosa morphine - cure for pain or yes tom wait - rain dog or swordfish trombone jeff buckley - grace or sketch for my sweetheart the drunk 4. you simply love a great guitarist , then pick up these album instead : leo kottke - my foot are smiling , greenhouse or 6 & 12 string guitar robert johnson - king of the delta blue volume 1 and 2 jeff beck - you had it coming , blow by blow or wired dillinger escape plan - calculating infinity king crimson - in the court of the crimson king or starless and bible black built to spill - there is nothing wrong with love or keep it like a secret the jimi hendrix experience - are you experienced ? , axis bold a love or electric ladyland the yardbird - over under sideways down or having a rave up wes montgomery - smoking at the half note or full house 5. you just love well arranged , complex , moving or eclectic music , then pick up these album instead : the zombie - odyssey and oracle the move - shazam charles mingus - pithecanthropus erectus , mingus ah um ! or oh yeah broken social scene - you forgot it in people mile davis - round about midnight , steamin , cookin , sketch of spain or kind of blue art pepper - plus eleven or meet the rhythm section love - forever change or da capo the byrd -notorious byrd brother , turn ! turn ! turn or younger than yesterday the band - the band or music from big pink mahavishnu orchestra - inner mounting flame brian eno - here come the warm jet or another green world p.s . if you really desire something profoundly lyrical , read some poetry . i would suggest theodore roethke , t.s . eliot , allen ginsberg or ezra pound to any nirvana listener , established or potential , ( or basically to anyone for that matter ) .
0	the record wa warped
0	having the lp were did the dvd come from ? being a crazy fan of the fox and it is mighty wurlitzer i bought the ( 3 ) album and have transfered them to cd . went to the last two midnight concert were there wasnt standing room in the building . seating about 4000+ now sf ha a world class organ sitting in a wearhouse covered with dust awaiting to be reinstaled in the civic building and not being done because the city father can not get off their tail and get it done . if they do not want to do it let general publit do it .
0	i have been a fan of heart since 1976 but i must say this album is a stinker . i thought the sister wilson wanted to rock on this record . sorry . but i aint hearing it here .
0	this recent purchase wa resold for a couple dollar ! it is virtually all noise . the vocal by mick jagger are ragged and imo there is not a single good song among . the lot .
0	if the u shock & awe campaign rained a many bomb a joe derosas latest comedy album doe , the iraq war wouldve been won in a week .

1	the song is one of roberta flack most memorable song dating back to the seventy when she sang at mr. henry in dc .
1	shinedown being shinedown at their best ! similar yet very different from all their other offering ! keep it up gentleman !
1	my boy favorite song . they sing this to the top of their lung . the youngest say we are fighting the devil when we sing this song nan ! anointed !
1	they got better with age !
0	i had hope of nice old style quality christmas hymn and song from guidepost vinyl album we have . not so . this is a 3 cd set and load of track but many of them are kind of jazz style , strange slow singing and empty feeling . there were a few pleasant traditional piece , but you have to wade through a number of dragging song to get there . if you want to experiment it might be worth the money , but if you are looking for some uplifting christmas music i would not recommend this .
1	great time to have this a an anthem , i change the lyric to dancing through the wire b/c i am champion sorry katie , but that is what it felt like to me . i had to dance through wire to be with her , dangerous and not a good thing to do .
0	made in aut in 1996 , serial # 33215-2 , playing time 51:45 this is album # 9 from canada self-proclaimed metal queen , and represents a drastic departure in style and sound texture from her previous album . emotional rain , her previous album , displayed more subdued rock and better polished melody than it predecessor , but this present album switch gear into what i call the nowhere rock genre . i like la singing , and la & 2p demonstrates her talent . but everything around that is a great disappointment . from the opening note of the first track , in which the vocal seemed to have been recorded in a large underground garage ( maybe it wa ) , i wa afraid this album would be a musical catastrophe : the instrumentation is basic , poorly recorded , but mostly pointless : it is music without melody or purpose , and even though some of the arrangement are at time ( but rarely ) adequate , you will not be captivated by any of it . this album wa a 1-off : her latest , slick chick , is a tribute to swing : talk about lack of constant direction ! perhaps this will be enjoyable to people ignorant of lee previous album , since they will have nothing to compare it with . but if you are somewhat familiar with album like powerline , bodyrock or metal queen , be careful this time : try to borrow a copy from someone else first , or listen to some song sample : this is no traditional lee aaron .
0	thought it would be a lighter selection of music , but way to somber for me .

1	awesome and funny
0	i wanted pg version , the one i bought had too much cussing in it
0	i have been a xtina fan since her genie in a bottle day . i wa a teen when she first came out so i kinda feel like i have grown up with her music . first off , her voice is absolutely amazing . some people may not consider her iconic but her voice is one in a million . most people that came up around christinas time do not even compare in vocal range . she had such a big voice for a pop star who did not get a chance to really show off her skill or her real personality with her first album . but stripped wa a chance for her to show the world what she could do on her own term and in her own word . stripped is my absolute favorite album of all time . she sang from the heart and great experience . she took u on a journey of finding her own voice ( in the figurative and literal sense ) , writing her own song , and working with the people she wanted to work with . teaming up with scott storch wa one of the best thing she is ever done career wise . i do not know what happened between them , but she ha not been the same xtina i fell in love with on stripped . though back to basic wa successful and i did enjoy her double disced work ; it did not quite catch the essence of strippeds christina . bionic wa a huge fail , even though she had a couple of great song on it that got overshadowed by truly horrible pop song . lotus wa an even bigger fail that made me wonder if christinas reign wa up after stripped . there may be a couple of song i could tolerate on this album which is why i gave it 2 star but they are nowhere near memorable . it really suck because xtina is a truly talented individual . but either she need to retire from music or get it together .
1	i just watched the blu-ray of the movie woodstock - it ha the csn & y version at the end of the movie , but jm get a separate credit for writing the song .
1	use to deliver morning newspaper listening to this on tape .
1	excellent album
1	this song is awesome
1	great album with a list of quality song .
1	an excellent song ( and prayer ) for every believer ! help me to keep my focus on my heavenly hope . i think most of u long for our heavenly home and to be with our loved one that have gone before u .
0	pretentious , bombastic and utterly devoid of charm , this is exactly the kind of thing spinal tap parodied in performing stonehenge . this is truly one of the worst album i have ever heard .
1	after jim reef died tragically in a plane crash on july 31 , 1964 at age 39 , his legion of fan simply refused to let go . from that point to 1984 no le than 34 of his rca single release would make the country chart , seven of them crossing over to the billboard pop hot 100. not even the late , great hank williams or elvis presley received that ultimate honour . i can therefore well understand the difficulty faced by producer paul williams in putting this 20-selection compilation together under the title the essential jim reef . to please everyone would be nigh on impossible considering the fact he had 80 country hit single between 1953 and 1984 , 27 of which crossed over to the hot 100 , six to the adult contemporary chart ( which did not begin until 1961 ) , and one to the r & b chart . never mind the hundred of equally-wonderful selection from his many eps and lp . all in all , however , i would say he did a fairly credible job , augmented by five page of liner note by colin escott and three more photo of jim , including one with wife mary at an award ceremony . a partial discography of the content is also included , but without any chart detail . all but track 20 [ recorded in 1958 and included on an early lp ] were hit for jim , 18 of them pop crossover [ only track 4 made only the country list , going to # 2 early in 1959 ] . his version of the old standard , i love you because , wa recorded in 1962 and wa first released on the rca victor lp gentleman jim and , in 1976 , became a # 54 country hit a a single . note , too , that the version of am i losing you wa the one cut in 1960 and released on rca victor 7800 , going to # 8 country/ # 31 hot 100 a the flipside of i missed me [ # 3 country/ # 44 hot 100 and not included here ] , the first version , done in 1957 [ # 3 country ] , remains a bit difficult to find . the earliest hit represented here , and the one that lead off the disc , is four wall [ # 1 country for eight week in 1957 ] which wa his initial pop crossover [ # 11 ] . however , this came after 13 country hit beginning in 1953 with mexican joe [ # 1 for nine week credited to jim reef and the circle o ranch boy ] . so i tend to agree with another reviewer who say that at least one of those should have been included in an essential cd . not counting the first six , five of which were for the abbott label and one , i love you , a # 3 duet with ginny wright on the fabor label , there were seven rca cut to choose from . the best of these included the afore-mentioned am i losing you , a well a yonder come a sucker and according to my heart , both # 4 . still , it is hard to be critical of this fine effort which richly deserves every one of the maximum 5 star .
0	a great slow song . i loved this slow song when i wa a teen in high school . i think it came out immediately after if i ever . i thought the tall one wa sooooooo fiiiiiiine ! not too long after , i became a freshman in college . music ha always been a great companion of mine . their unison are great . harmony a+ . their tenor and baritone voice are great in this song . it is a classic . they remind me of the guy from the platter , i think that is my grandparent generation .
0	this album just did not do it for me . i got it when it came out , because i have all their cd and love them to death . it is too girly and poppy for me , high-pitched . the lyric are not all that clear , and do not mesh well together to mean one thing . most of all , the melody of the song are hard to listen to . you know how some song are just . difficult for the ear to enjoy ? these song are fine most of the time . but then almost all of them have a difficult spot where the melody ( or the singing ) is difficult to listen to . there are a few really enjoyable , feeling-filled song though . control , secret , and sleepwalking get 5 star from me . the rest get about 3 star . i can not relate to them much , and i do not get much pleasure from listening to them . but i will always love tbms older stuff , and their newer hide and seek album .
0	never had
0	it wasnt worth the wait
1	great
1	excellent product and service .
1	i love this song , and amazon make it totally worth it because unlike stupid itunes , you can keep downloading it to a new phone , or redownload it if your internet dy or something in the middle of the download , all for free . see itunes , if u loose internet connection in the middle of the down load , or your power go out , or you get a new computer you have to buy the song all over again , trust me , i experienced that huge problem with itunes more than once . where a amazon is awesome cause it is all on your account , so you just log in and it is there , and it show that you payed the $ 1 for it so it is yours . even if you get a new phone , or ipod , or loose internet connection or whatever . your logged it , it is your account you payed for it , it all leagle , and it is yours , for like ever . : d in my own personal opinion i highly highly highly recomend you download song , and buy song from amazon.com verse buying it on itunes . c :
1	i have worn it out , also gave a gift to family .
1	album of the year !
1	this is a splendid sampler of classical greatest hit featured in film . i have been enjoying it while working and it enlivens my day .
0	we ordered early and waited with bated breathe . but this just wasnt up to her usual . it felt like she wa trying hard to address a younger , le universal audience . it also felt like she had forced the new song - they did not flow . and the male vocal did not mix with her voice . disappointing .
0	bought this from amazon .the song are not in original order that wa on album , buy the original .if you can much better
0	i do not understand this at all . there are no redeeming quality to this recording whatsoever and no reason for it to exist . i am a avid a fan of bob dylan a there is but he doe not serve himself well with atrocity such a this or that inane christmas album . i have to go listen to blood on the track and oh mercy now before my mind implodes .
1	another hit .
1	i like this song , i love that usher gave a sweet undertone to a dance type song . i like just about everything from guetta .
1	great .
0	i did not enjoy this album a much a the previous album .
0	it pain me to see so many 1 star review coming from dylan own fan base . i have been a fan for over 40 year , and i can not disagree with the negative opinion rendered . bob dylan voice ha been shot for quite a few year now , but that ha not stopped him from making critically acclaimed album like modern time . this holiday outing is not laughable a some have stated , but it is an embarrassment that columbia record released it in the first place , and in the process exposed dylan now vulnerable voice that sound painfully inadequate . the only song on this entire cd that work is must be santa , which should have been released a a limited edition x-mas single for this charitable cause . his live show have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice . he change all the arrangement of his song during live show , because he can no longer sing those note a they were recorded . there come a time in everyones life , when it is time to get off the stage , whether you are a doctor , heavy equipment operator , or in this case an musician . i believe that the time ha come for bob dylan to do exactly that , and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career , without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter .
0	because the song cut where the explicit word would go . i wish i could get a refund , i ended up buying the explicit version instead
1	i saw paul simon live 2 day before this album came out . usually when you see an artist and they have new stuff , you generally do not want to hear it , you wan na hear the hit . this wa a special case . he played about 5 or 6 song from this new album and literally had the crowd begging for more . i wa blown away . he talk about how he spent some time in the amazon , going on a spiritual journey , drinking this root tea which turned out to be ayahuasca , and seeing spirit . for a 74 year old man , it is quite impressive and hilarious . i am very excited to finally own this whole album .
1	this music reminds me of the early album of gary numan , mostly because of the instrumentation used . i like the science fiction theme and robby garner vocal . prodigy 7 ha become one of my favorite , and i really like control .
0	useless
1	so , band of horse is a new band to me . suffice to say , it is now a if i have been a fan for year . their song are infectious , a they are deep and meaningful . the instrumentation , vocal , and composition are fantastic . what a song .
0	volume is low when put in a mall radio .
1	great song . no one but him could sing it with such feeling . love that song and singer . thank you george .
1	i first heard this song while watching the movie , tha naked gun starring leslie nielson . i like it !
0	im sure because of the extensive time served by all or any of the member of this band , that they understand and have the right to depict military life during war . this song and it lyric are whimsical nonsense based on no real experience , and a shame to the troop especially those who have served in combat . per this band clearly troop in combat have no moral or self control , and were mostly just complacent killer .
0	i bought this because it popped up a an ad on a youtube video of the song , but it wasnt the same version a in the video . i deleted it .
1	excellent work of art . she is on target with every song . seems to relay a pervasive quality of despairing depression underneath the provocative , bad girl image . some people want to boycott her album until she get help but there is no question , this is a top quality production .
0	there is no question that jennifer lopez ha been a lot of the news lately , and not for her music . it ha been for her work with american idol , and for her marriage to marc anthony ending in a sour split . but for her latest single , she want to try and recapture whom she wa a singer before , and fails to do it on papi , the third single from her album love ? the song is not really a driven a some of her other dance song from before in her career . in fact , hearing it now , feel like a weak kitten than a striking and strong tiger . good luck to jennifer on her other project , but love ? wasnt really feeling the love at all , with the exception of on the floor . song : d
0	i think that i must have got a bad copy because this sacd sound awful ! it sound like a cd from 1985
0	not sure the guy is signing , but it is not brett young , that is for damn sure ! ekkk
1	can not go wrong with lauren daigle , she ha s an anointing on her
1	gorgeous music that go through your soul !
0	i tried to purchase this song on the amazon app for blackberry but instead of getting this one song the app tried to get me to download the whole album . now i am trying to figure out how to get a refund . love the song but the technology could be better .
0	not traditional music , very synthesized new native music - not what i wa expecting .
1	nice cd
1	love it !
1	i have been following the songwriter singer since 2006/2007 a a member of brogian bard and independent solo artist and have never heard something that i did not like and usually loved marc gunn is talented in many different hat such a podcaster for celtic music in many different format listen to him again and again a he always make you feel ultimately good even his death song album . his take and twist on scifi and parody are among the best
1	wonderful tune and lyric .
1	i thought this wa annoying at first-and it is . but it is much le annoying than most kid cd . it stand up to repeated play .
1	when i bought this cd , i did not know what track were on it . so i am listing the track . this is a live album , but do not know if it is recorded at once , since it stop between track . cd1 1 foxey lady 4:50 2 i do not live today 5:29 3 red house 10:49 4 spanish castle magic 11:26 5 star-spangled banner 2:23 6 the wind cry mary 3:41 7 burning of the midnight lamp 3:48 8 fire 2:47 cd2 1 purple haze 5:51 2 voodoo child ( a slight return ) 9:15 3 sunshine of your love 4:14 4 voodoo child ( reprise ) 3:23 5 catfish blue 7:43 6 killing floor 5:07 7 can you please crawl out your window 3:02 8 hey joe 6:12 the cd ha no booklet , so there is no information about when or where this live album wa recorded . i am not a die-hard hendrix fan so i would not know if these were previously released or not , by just listening to them . the quality of the music doe sound a little bit unusual , like if i wa listening to a cassette that is been played too much , not your usual cd clarity . but maybe this is common of live recording , i do not know , or if the music is bootleg or whatever . or maybe it is my cd player fault . but i bought this cd at 1 cent price , so overall i am pleased with this purchase because jimi hendrix is a good artist .
0	there seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fan to boost the rating of this cd by posting glowing review , so it is going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give 5 * to a recording of groban reading the telephone directory . i also presume , therefore , that any review that are not favourable will come with a 2/17 people found this review of use attached . all i can say is that if you are considering purchasing this cd , are not a self-confessed music starved groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several year , and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service - take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it . the mixed review really do indicate that this album is polarising listener and fan , not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that ha crept in . you may enjoy it , but i would try before you buy first . my own personal thought - i will freely admit that i wa never a serious fan of the early work groban did with david foster and i do not view this a a foster v rubin thing , so this is not a hankering for a return to the older style recording . in fact , i wa eagerly anticipating this album based on what groban had said about changing direction . he had actively played that up in interview and the choice of working with rick rubin seemed to indicate this , a did his live version of changing colour which i really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often . however , i do not feel that he is done that . and yet , at the same time , i think he is charged off in many different direction . i just do not know what to make of this album , even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen time or so when i would rather have left it alone . i am aware that some album require work to grow on you , hence i wanted to give it a chance , but this is not happening . sadly it is the opposite effect and every time i listen , there is a reinforcement of why i do not enjoy it and can not face listening to some of the track . the nick cave cover ? massive orchestral arrangement . an italian song ? massive orchestral arrangement . london hymn ? i am expecting to hear it booming out of westminster abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock . interspersed with song that are , i presume , the stripped-down sound groban wa hoping to achieve . to me , it just doe not flow or have any coherence a an album . i just feel that it is trying to be so many different thing , and in doing so it unfortunately miss the mark . i find the lyric at time to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written a ; i honestly believe that groban , judging from awakes february song , can express a far greater depth of emotion than he doe here . some of the harsher remark regarding the reaction of laughter at some lyric that are expressed in some review are , i probably can guess , even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fan . having said that , i certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow a an artist and experiment musically - even if it sometimes miss the mark . i can not face giving this one star , because i do not want to relegate it to that level and i genuinely do applaud artist for attempting to push their own boundary . but i wish i would have waited before ordering the cd - like another reviewer , i can not cancel the order winging it way over the atlantic . sadly it is staying in the packaging , to be gifted to someone that i am probably not that close to . edited to add - i have noticed some commenting regarding what i said about fan posting positive review because of a perceived backlash to the album . my comment came a a result of a thread on his official board , [ . ] , entitled be sure to leave a 4 or 5 star review on amazon.com . the cd could use them . i merely think that people who are not fan , and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them , should hear a balance of opinion . jg fan have ( rightly or wrongly ) a reputation a being aggressively protective towards him , and whilst all the positive review are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album , many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music - that thread wa sent a a link to many fan , and a such it could have an impact on here . i think it is only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves .
0	boring
0	love greg , hate this song . own 40 to 50 this one should never been recorded . should return it , but keep it to remind me to look again before i push the purchase button . lousum
1	well done . well done .
0	the killer were one of the hot band out there . they caught most people with their bombastic , overly-stylish music , they also made a lot of enemy making their style over substance music . musically their style ha not changed much , but their attitude ha changed greatly for their own demise . the killer tried to show their depth to win some more fan , but in doing this they showed that nothing wa there . the lyric come off a weird ( in a bad way ) and stupid ; plus , the sound of flower voice doesnt fit the song at all . the illusion and wit wa better than nothing ( plain stupidity ) , and while this album may be slightly deeper , it is not an improvement . i had thought that the killer should drop flower and now i truly believe that . his voice is like a honking seal that hurt the ear and this album doesnt play to his carefree bombastic style that make him sound ok. the killer could not sucessfully change from a glam-rock band to something deeper and flower is one of the main problem ( i would hate to see him live ) . in doing this they have not improved their music and have lost fan . fyi - i wa not in love with their first album , so this ha nothing to with expectation . and i did not hate their last album , so i am not solely a killer basher . overall - 4/10 , i pronounce the killer dead . wait ! it seem some still think the are the best thing ever ( you know you are in love if you like flower voice ) . p.s . while the song when you were young is pretty good , it is by far the best song on the album and yes it is fairly stupid .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
0	did not order this
0	great version of this tune . this and dread zeppelin version are both very cool for different reason . however , it is fuzzy sounding , and doe not quite play through to the end chopping off about 5 second . i will try to get a refund . it is so much better sitting at my home theater watching the credit of the movie . the visuals add more than you can know .
0	excellent presentation , but it is the worst floyd album ever ! they should regret to had produced it .
1	still a dynamic and sexy song from an amazing artist ,
1	i love lucinda williams and she did not disappoint me . west is another great group of song !
1	jonatha brooke ha one of the most beautiful voice i have ever heard . she is also one of the most under-rated songwriter in the country . the story wa a rather short-lived 2-person group formed back in the early 90 that included jennifer kimball . the harmony that jonatha and jennifer created were/are inspired , and at time , their heart wrenching melody could bring you to tear . my two favorite song from jonatha are so much mine ( from story - angel in the house ) and eye in the sky ( from jonatha brooke - back in the circus ) . so much mine ( my absolute favorite ) is a gorgeous song played impeccably well by highly skilled musician . the singing by jonatha is buttery smooth and is a perfect example of her true artistry . the eye in the sky track from one of jonathas solo album is an almost haunting rendition of the song by the same title from the alan parson project , release back in 1982. i am also a big fan of that band . all of jonathas album , both solo and from the story , are highly recommended . her voice would melt even the hardest of heart and her song writing , along with her interpretation of other artist song , is inspiring and ( at time ) haunting . her song stay ( and play ) in your head for a long time and when you consider her body of work ( a a whole ) , i just can not imagine why she is not more popular . some of her music ha an almost latin flavor to it ; latin rhythm and percussion that make you want to dance , while some of her song make you want to cry . she is that good . i do not know what else to say/write , other than buy her music !
1	i like this album it is great . i am 10 year old and i love this album . all of the beat are really great and the lyric are really great and 50 cent is a really good rappper and i just love this cd cause it is so good . this is what rap music is all about , really good beat and really good lyric and really good rapping . 50 cent is the best rapper ever , i listen to this cd every day after school while i am eating my snack pack and watching sister sister on the wb . it is good my mom bought it for me for my birthday along with justin timberlakes new cd . that is great too i love both cd but 50 cent is especially good .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	fantastic i love it love it love it , della lift the heart & stir the soul . i start my day with this if at all possible , praise god ! it is best to give your day to the lord , this is the way to do it . i reccommended it highly . jojo
1	another great celtic thunder cd
0	this review is only for this version of the album ( the remastered expanded edition ) . the mastering sound overly compressed , and eddy vocal do not sound loud enough . the instrument sound way too loud and it drowns out eddy voice on some of the track . it baffle me how record company can keep releasing these crappy remasters that actually sound worse than the original album . people are paying good money to buy a newer and crappier version of the same album . save your money and buy the original 1993 edition instead . the bonus 3 song are great , but the remastering wa entirely pointless .
1	it is one of my favorite son from the 80
0	okay , this effort is certainly more inspired than victim of love or 21 at 33. but even though it is a comeback in comparison to those two failed album , this recording still pale in comparison to goodbye yellow brick road , honky chateau , rock of the westies , etc . many of the song on the fox come frustratingly close to being classic ej song ( just like belgium , chloe , the title track ) . but sadly the song fall a bit short . my advice ? skip this one and purchase jump up , which is not a great album , but is a better example of elton john returning to anything even close to his 70 form .
0	strong political view that are ranted about through the medium . refuse to listen to it a second time .
0	not worth the wait or the money . if i want some foreigner to preach to me about politics and the state of the world i will turn on the any of the left owned television station or read the slanted truth on the internet . i will be throwing mine in the trash could not sit though 3 song . please stop shoving you political view down our throat and start to entertain with some great music .
1	this song brings back memory of my teenage year . i love most of their music anyway . they sure can sing !
0	i always liked this song . i like the werewolf of london too . he is a great classic rock artist to listen to .
0	i should have just bought the one song that i liked . the 3 song on the radio are the only one that are worth a s * , the rest of the album suck . which wa quite surprising and disappointing coming from katy perry . i would recommend others to only buy the song they like . and leave the rest .
1	great . sound a i remember it .
1	this song is a sure thing for when you need a pick me up !
1	not a good a the first one , but sequel rarely are . it is good none the le .
0	intro is ok lol
0	got for a friend to hear kid sound creepy
1	good quality sound and it wa the original . enjoyed listening to this - took me back a few year when i heard it on the radio .
1	this is not the classic tsfh that everyone is used to . this is not along of the line of invincible or archangel . this is pure evil coming from thomas bergersen and nick pheonix . some of the song are downright painful to listen to , but they are still fascinating to listen to . most of the music in this album come from their first few collection , such a shadow and nightmare , ash , and dynasty . there is a much , much darker , evil , grating sound . it is the kind of sound you would expect from an outstanding horror movie . for whatever reason , the song to die on halloween is hand down , the creepiest song in this whole album . it ha a very light , almost fun bounce to it , but the lyric are downright horrifying . chop off a limb . batter and bake , what do we get from the light of the sun ? a nasty burn now is not that fun ? it would be like barney brutally murdering all of his kid . it is just fantastically brilliant .
1	amazing album been with j. cole since the warm-up , good to see he still keep it real .
0	could not add it to a class slideshow presentation . only streamed . boo
0	i do not know what she is saying . the only reason i assume is because i do know the song silent night . now how do i delete it ?
0	if it were not so badly warped it would be fantastic . maybe if you are lucky and get another batch . . .
1	another solid song from the new skillet album that showcase their softer side . while this is not nearly the side if skillet i often listen to , it is good enough in it own right . rating : 4
1	dynamic
1	jessye norman ha a voice that is rich a the most elegant satin . i have purchased quite a few of her piece , why ? because thanks to amazon music , i can pick and choose and download the one i want . i have now loaded many of her spiritual , both solo and with kathleen battle , onto both the computer and my mp3 player , to enjoy whenever i choose . her singing is grand , the selecton is wonderful , and the price is right .
0	well , having listened to this c.d. , i am sorry to say this album is pure crap ! yes , i am a die hard beatles fan , but i can not figure why anybody would like this recording . the instrument sound cheap , the drummer is woeful and the sound in part sound thin . i admit this is an early offering by the fab three and poor drummer , but part of this are unlistenable . i heard my mate copy and would not even bother to buy it myself . very poor album .
0	this song is pretty slow , i think . i do not know why i did not like it . i just did not like it very much .
1	iv been collecting mucic for over 53 year and let me tell you that this 2 cd super rock . this is one cd i am proud to have in my collection !
1	my favorite version of the ave maria ! i particularly like that there is not a lot of vibrato . so happy amazon ha this !
0	not even going to waste my time writing in detail about this piece of trash . it is a shame what pass for hip-hop these day . people seem to be more in love with weezys production than his lyric , which is apparent to anyone that actually care about the lyric at all , because lil wayne is whack . i am not a hater , i do not gain anything by dissing lil wayne at all . he is just another average , untalented , main stream clown in this giant cesspool of noise these record company are trying to pas off a hip-hop . also , the fact that people are claiming that the album in the carter trilogy are classic is unsettling to my stomach . if this dude the best there is , you guy can have him ; i prefer a little more substance in my music .
1	my first exposure to this song wa in a disney cartoon . back when mtv played music , my parent purchased dtv video on laser disc that had pop music set to disney animation . this wa my favorite one of them all . i still love this song . for me it is both nostalgic and upbeat .
1	i will start off by saying that i am one of those completist type . i have to own everything by maybe a certain band , or person . i mention this because a man named john dwyer is a principal member of yikes ! , a well a at least 8 other band . i own everything he is done , and i have to admit , this particular album get the most play . you will know dwyer from his raunchy day of coachwhip fame . he did yikes ! right after coachwhip , and it show . it is extremely thick , reverb-soaked screaming madness- but the catch is that it is much slower . it is not psychobilly or punk , but extremely loud , thick , heavy drug-induced blue type stuff , with dwyers indiscernible voice wailing over every note . do yourself a serious favor and pick up both yikes ! album right now . they are quite short , but they pack one of the most memorable punch that a genre could possibly offer .
1	great 80 song !
0	thanks to the reviewer who mentioned this wa a free download when you install the amazon software . i wa trying to figure out why i had purchased this since i have no recollection of doing so , or ever heard of the artist . very generic song , no redeeming quality for me . sound like just about everything else out there .
1	i have enjoyed buying music for my kindle because i have found all my oldie but goody . sound quality is excellent .
0	i am sorry but i did not like this cd . i wa so impressed the last couple of year watching these kid grow up and enjoyed their cover of my favorite classic rock band and some of their own creation like a piece of rock and roll and drama queen , ( very good song ) but this eternalize cd fell way short . musically these kid are very talented and great musician , however i thought the song writing wa bad , the lyric bad , and the vocal were bad - vocal were very monotone and lacking emotion and range and feeling . sarah need to take ownership of the vocal and put her own signature and personality into them - not just read them off the sheet of paper . she is young and i know with some good teaching and coaching she can develop this talent . remember her janis joplin cover turtle blue ? that is what i am talking about . she need to do more of that . this band ha much more talent than what wa displayed on this latest cd . somebody need to help them with their songwriting . it wa all over the place on this cd . i am hoping they can turn it around , but for now i am backing off for a while to see where they go from here . good luck you guy .
0	first of all i admire and respect alvin and am sorrowed at his passing . this album wa not one of his best . the guitar work is weak and the song are very disjointed .
1	what an awesome collection of relevant artist on this cd . something fresh to hear and my favorite , bruno mar is featured on one of the track . if you do not want to buy it to support the producer & artist by making the purchase at least take a few minute to listen to the sample . i am guessing you will want to download some of the track to add to your personal collection . many of them are that good .
1	we all listen to different music ( classical , country , heavy metal , blue , rap , pop , folk . ) so it is rare when we like the same band . this is the band . this is album is wonderful . not a stinker in the lot = )
0	not impressed the tune the beat and the voice not good for me do not know what could of been better
0	this cd sound tinny . there is no base , just too much treble . it sound like listening to a cd on a boombox with the bass boost turned off .
0	i have been a huge fan of chicago for the past 30 year and i must say i am very disappointed with this album . like many chicago fan i am partial to the classic chicago that peaked in the early seventy . these were the time in which the band had a diversity of style and vocalist ( robert lamm , terry kath , and peter cetera ) however , a most fan know , the peter cetera sound tended to dominate their work in the late seventy and early eighty . so , one might ask , what wa i expecting ? for starter i wa expecting more contribution from lamm and jimmy pankow . although i am sure jimmy had a big part in the horn arrangement , he did not contribute a single song . robert contributed very little , too . if you watch one of the chicago concert dvd or get to see them live , you will agree that this band still ha it . i have to wonder what they have been doing 9from a compositional standpoint ) for the last 15 year ? robert lamms solo release subtlety and passion ( s & p ) is an excellent effort . and in many way it seems more chicago than xxx . why could not robert have saved some of his material ( i.e . somewhere girl ) for this new release ? instead the album is dominated by jason scheffs slow ballad - which seem to be doing exactly what the band that cetera did . there are some funky mix here , but what are they ? they sure do not seem too chicago . and then there are the horn . everybody know that the chicago horn gave the band it trademark distinction . while the horn seem to be wonderfully integrated on lamms s & p , on xxx they seem to be an added afterthought - forced and contrived . also , the cheesy 80 percussion mixing sound of their hot single mix free just make it seem , a if instead of trying to create inspiring music a they once did , they are trying too hard to reach the commercial mass with a single . these guy are talented musician . they do not need to prove themslelves to anybody . where is their integrity ? simply put , i feel this album is a huge missed opportunity .
0	do not buy this . not the actual song and is only a partial 30 sec long .
1	good sound quality and memory ! love journey song .
0	this is one of my favs from a boy named goo , the cd best known for the goo goo doll breakthrough hit name . this mp3 version of flat top sound horrible - it sound like some of the downloads my sister friend used to get from limewire , where there wa this hissing that sounded like someone wa running a drum stick along the cymbal . i have owned this on cd several time b/c i have a hard time holding onto anything and there are a couple bona fide bad song on abng , and i am not always in the mood for the downbeat long way down ( trk1 ) . but over the course of owning this cd off and on , i have listened to it many time , this is not the way it is supposed to sound . i listen to this on my desktop pc via my amazon cloud , just like all my other music that i bought in mp3 format and this is not up to bar with anything that cost money . if this were a independent release , i could maybe forgive this mishap . but warner bros./wea is either greedy or stupid . this is inexcusable .
1	song wa super . the amazon player is a total pain in the neck . i had problem playing the song with my usual mp3 and wmp program and i just do not want to get any more song from amazon until that problem is non-existent .
1	a star is born !
1	another one of that amazon had a a sampler when i got it . i have enjoyed listening to this countless time . i also recommend the 2013 version .
1	i am a little late to join the party when it come to this artist , but wanted to buy his cd after seeing the video for thinking out loud on youtube ( i did not realize it had been played to death on the radio according to friend ) i love the cd . it is awesome to find an artist that actually play real instrument , writes their own music , with lyric that actually convey human emotion . wonder never cease .
1	for what it is , it is a great tune sung by a sensational band and the video by the way is a cinematic classic . brilliant !
0	sound like rap and i do not care a bit for it
0	i guess i do not have the right device to play them . unable to view .
0	this chick is ridiculous , she sound like a britney spear on crack . there is absolutely no talent on this bitch .
1	good
1	case wa cracked .
1	this concept and music/dvd combo is one of the coolest thing ever ! the music is phenominal ( who would have expected le ? ) and the live/acoustic and cd/dvd package is an off the chart idea . in a day and age where people frequently fail to deliver , hat off to shinedown for coming through in a major way !
1	can you wait , love this song . have been waiting on this cd to come out for a long time . worth the wait .
1	i do not care what religion she is ; the music is good , and i hope her publicity stunt really pay off . all those rich celebrity who are in the closet a conservative did not have the gut to do what she did yesterday ! she is a strong , independent , fearless woman that hopefully just paved the way for more conservative celebrity to just come out already !
1	the long awaited debut album from stalley doe not disappoint . trunk rattling bass , ode to old school and midwest pimping at it best !
0	it is unfortunate that there is not a negative rating scale . the disc took five week to arrive . both the sound quality and the rendition of the song were abysmal , even if one could tolerate the rather shabby packaging . recycled the day it arrived .
0	i bought this album and accidentally had it playing in a snapchat i sent to my friend , next day i got sued .
1	wonderful cd ! one of brandis best . highlight are the eye and wherever is your heart
1	i love it . thanks . the cd arrived on time and wa a described
1	i like the rythm
0	once i would downloaded this song , i felt deceived by the sample clip available here . cincotti definitely ha potential , but he ruined what couldve been a beautiful song by trying to sing high note that were beyond his range . he sounded rather screechy . the title track wa also somewhat misleading , because it led me to expect a slow , tender seduction song , not a sad one . i do think peter could do really well if he learned to work within his vocal range and select better material to sing .
1	typical hank williams , jr. modern country with a serious message . make me proud to be an american .
0	i generally like starbombs music , for what it is . and what it is is a blend of pop , rap , video game parody , and novelty music . a far a those quality go , the artist have not deviated from their theme . however , compared to the first starbomb album , i felt this wa a huge step down . the song just are not a unique , comical , or lively . aside from smash ! , the track are pretty forgettable . some of the song make reference to the previous album , which might seem like a nice touch , but i felt like it wa done more a an attempt to play off a previous song success rather than a a clever insertion for nostalgia . i still bought the album to support egoraptor , whose video game review on youtube i love . bought i can not really recommend this album otherwise .
0	i did not like this version of this song , but since this wa free , i guess i should not complain .
1	there must have been a bunch of ripe song sitting around the basement when juliana hatfield showed up to help record them . some of these are truly fantastic - my faves since the mat . others are not so great , but they may grow on me . ( but not that one about bird . ) i am just happy paul is digging out some gem and recording them in an inspired way . if it take romance to make that happen , so much the better .
0	i yawned . i actually yawned .
0	i do not see what everyone see in this dude . this album suck his beat are only appealing because of sampling . lyric are straight garbage a usual people wake up look behind poppy beat and mainstream appeal ! u wan na hear some real hiphop look for dude like elzhi and reks .
1	excellent
0	her voice is not the problem but the arrangement is boring with harsh repetive line . i would like to hear her sing this song with the help of a different backup band , arranger and composer .
0	save your money .
0	i have bought music through amazon preferring them to itunes because because itunes try to control their music too much . however after the latest mp3 purchase , i find it now amazon ha made it a difficult a possible to download their music to my itunes . bye-bye amazon . i guess i am gon na have to go back to the itunes store a much a i hate to .
0	i for some reason do not like this song at all , i find it very annoying . how do i delete this song off my play list . lol
0	i wa surprised to hear that this song wa released by another artist , but jmcs rendition is devoid of life and utterly forgettable when compared to christian kanes power ballad . i would highly recommend folk go over to christian page here on amazon and listen to his wonderful version of this song on his album house rule .
1	i love jason album !
0	i became quite a fan of otto bekker after his sitar & electronics work . i have tried to find other recording by okko that might be similar in style . so far i have had only moderate success . hybrid fart ( that name should have been my first clue , if we are even talking about a bekker cd ) everything is in german which would be fine if it were a few le hard consonant ( not really the language of love , is it ? ) or perhaps not so wordy . for all i know the vocalist could be telling me how to make a great cupcake . and since okko bekker should look pretty much the same in english or german , i am not so sure it is even an okko bekker recording . i could not find his name anywhere on the cd package . granted i wa horrified by the sound emanating from my speaker that i did not look too long before i convinced my self that the german word on the front cover of the cd do not translate a hybrid fart . i think mr. bekker ha a bit more class than that . so if you are looking , like me , for something along the line of his sitar & electronics cd , which is a true gem , then run a fast a you can in the opposite direction . the music struck me a 21st century german pub rock with vocal mixed far too loud . sort of like the end of day rough mix . until you or i can find a good successor to sitar & electronics , let me suggest anything by saddar bazaar or orient squeezer . a far a i know there are 2 release by each band , all 4 record are a magnificent journey on their own . if anyone know of recording by my bekker similar to s & e , please , please leave me the information in a comment to my review .
1	great album .
1	this music and the lyric really are enough to encourage you along the way . but the vocal are simply amazing and make it seem so easy . not everyone can do this .
0	j. walsh said what i thought about this album . huey lewis and the news were a great pop-rock , new wave sounding band , they did more blue in the past , now they are trying their take on soul . this is not the huey lewis and the news we all love . huey please try to do another rock album before retiring , i think you can still do it .
0	i bought this album after seeing the band electrifying performance on the clapton 2010 crossroad video and then , being unfamiliar with the band , went through the review here to try to find the best album . i do not agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performance . the song , except for the mostly instrumental one , are rather ordinary and even those do not sizzle ( like the live performance on crossroad . ) and the production quality is not great either- you can not really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he doe that . after two run-through , this will go in the heap of cd that i had great hope for but never listen to . great player , but mediocre songwriter : probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venue .
1	love it
1	found this mp3 download while browsing and remembered just how fabulous the door were . love this song and am really happy with the download !
1	i just finished watching philadelphia . the movie-one of the most moving ( and sad ) movie i have ever seen . not a dry eye in the house with this one ! the song ( neil young ) - perhaps one of the most beautiful and pensive love song i have ever heard . i want to own that song ( not necessarily the entire soundtrack ) .
0	let me say first i am a big james taylor fan . but this cd just suck . the music is great a usual , . but the lyric will lose you . there are two song on this cd that are ok , . but just ok. they are far afghanistan and maybe you and i again . the rest of the lyric are just hogwash . they are word of a man reminiscing about nothing in particular and everything in general and trying to make sense of it all . erg : ay caramba , one note samba , la la la la bamba .. or jolly springtime , oh the jolly springtime , in the merry month of may , oh the heavenly hour , oh the come again day . or the bird is on the wing , the bell is about to ring , the big girl she is about to sing , today , today , today . the opening song today , today , today is a horribly conceived song , . infantile rhyming pattern , melodyless monotone and very annoying nasal singing . perhaps brilliant artist like james taylor just lose their creativity and spontaneity a they grow older and are not able to focus on simple storytelling anymore . i do not know , . but i had to listen to this cd 4 time before i realized i had no idea what the hell he wa talking about .

1	excellent ! excellent ! excellent ! this is heaven . though l do not speak the lang the voice move me spiritually . i have been replaying the song since l bought it . doe he have other hymns/gospel in the same lang ? not english please . thank you for the heavenly song !
0	only one song on a cd music wonderful i wa looking for more music . at that price offering cd should be full very disappointing
1	another memorial song of whitney
1	it is a very happy song that you can not help but put on a great big smile to while you listen .
0	how can the album be 9.99 when the 2 track separately are each .99 ? what kind of price gouging is this ?
1	i wish more folk knew about ernests music . this is not your typical folk artist . ernest wa makin folk/blues/rock music in the 70 before he launched his composition career in la . film score , television score , & emmy later , he got back to his root & gave u the opportunity to enjoy where he came from ( his hobby a he describes it ) . listen to this album ! it wa released nearly a year & 1/2 before katrina . besides the prescient title cut , evangaline , disturbin blue , & travelin shoe should solidify your love of this talented composer , singer , song-writer , and guitarist par excellance !
0	listening to this cd , all the way through , wa neither easy nor enjoyable . if you like beat-driven pop with repetitious lyrical hook , you might like 0304. if you are expecting to be touched by another excellent jewel collection , prepare to have your heart broken . this cd truly disappointed everyone i know who ha heard it . it is pure pop drivel .
1	i had most of these number on two cassette tape , which eventually wore out , so i wa delighted to find they would been combined into one cd . the quality wa excellent and it wa like having an old friend who would moved away come back to the neighborhood !
0	i heard a lot about this chick patsy cline , like she wa supposedly a country singer with a beautiful voice . i wa curious so i checked her out , i had pretty high expectation because i doubt she could be better than taylor swift . i think that a 12 song compilation would be enough , and trust me . it wa enough . the sound quality on this album is horrible and the song sound really dated , patsy is also quite ugly and can not carry a tune . after you are done burning this album , also burn anything by alison krauss , emmylou harris , loretta lynn and old dolly parton . instead listen to real female country artist like shania twain , taylor swift , carie underwood , dixie chick , gretchen wilson , reba mcentire and sugarland .
1	great tune !
0	this cd length singe-track audio song is really just sound effect layered together to give the mood of a tropical jungle . i think it is south america or central america wildlife sound . generally , the audio is good and somewhat relaxing until the somewhere near the middle part of the track where a growl ( probably jaguar or leapord ) loudly punctuates the sequence . it is loud enough that the tranquility is shattered . once you know this is present in this recording , it becomes difficult to relax and enjoy listening to it again . imagine you knew someone wa going to yell in your ear at some random point within the next hour . now try to relax .
1	great
1	this song is very special to me a i am a proud navy wife . any song that honor the military is great . this song wa played at the funeral of a very special navy seal . it always brings tear to my eye .
1	love !
0	i wa unable to download this mp3 without downloading software i do not want ( amazon music player ) . i already have a music player , and it work fine . i just wanted a favorite tie song .
0	i loved the song , but it did not download all the way . i can only listen to part of the song .
0	i have always thought that the best of bon jovi wa richie sambora a he show u in his two previous job . but on this album i see the worst of the song of bon jovis last album . on the other hand , the sound of this cd is very noisy , like the style of some album of the 70 . in short , and for not doing more blood , this cd can be summarized a a couple of good song from a handful of bad and noisy song .
1	while clearly a tremendous technical achievement , this 2cd set is at the same time ranging and intimate in it expression - both explosive and contemplative . i love it !
1	listen to it so much , had to order another one ! want to make sure it doe not wear out !
0	this ha to be a joke . next he will duet with william hung . at least the profit go to charity . still just donate to charity and keep this garbage away from your ear .
1	simply put . yes . very relaxing . encouraging . motivating . hope instilling . inspiring . reminds you of good thing . encouraging you to remember the creator promise
1	great item , just what i needed .
0	very disappointed by this cd which i will probably listen to only once . ellings interpretation of most of these terrific song just grate , and his voice is nothing special . his butchering of on broadway is particularly heinous . i would have given the cd one star except for the really lovely version of paul simon american tune . a waste of money .
1	excellent song
1	what a fantastic gift from the fjord ! this cd is astoundingly well-crafted , every note seems perfectly placed , the lyric are wise and beautifully fitted to the music . generally , this is soft , warm , lulling music , but it doe not put you to sleep . toxic girl is catchy , jangly , and rhythmic- without ever seeming pretentious or overproduced . sing softly to me will have you snapping and nodding your head before you know it . there is a real soothing quality here , though , that can not be denied . fan of low and air should be quite pleased .
1	got this song in my head after watching true detective on tv , so i had to buy it !
1	great song !
1	excellent recording . i can not stop listening to this . once i bought this , i got all the other master in this series a well .
1	i love this album . god bless you , derek horton , wherever you are .
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
1	for me , all but one song made for a very good cd . their voice are growing in depth and enrichment . it is different music from their first cd some , like my father , who loved their first cd ( because it wa all of the italian favorite = and he is italian ) did not like this second album at all . my husband and i liked it very much !
1	excellent !
1	if this wa all you got for prime it would be worth it . amazon , i love you !
0	the first two were great and they will have shelf life . this wa rushed out for christmas & anyone that gave it more tan 2stars must be related . bad review like this cost u money & make the artist believe they did something right < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/iron-man-ultimate-two-disc-edition-bd-live-blu-ray/dp/b001gapc1k/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > iron man ( ultimate two-disc edition + bd live ) [ blu-ray < /a > ]
0	not that bad of a tribute cd , but a for myself , i would really prefer to listen to the actual floyd lp . the moon revisited is basically nine different unknown artist that cover one track each of the famed dark side of the moon album . if you are a major , and i do mean major floyd nut , you may get more out of this cd than i did . the track the great gig in the sky about had me nearly cry for mercy , the woman vocalist just go on and on . to put it another way , the moon revisited is like a pink floyd cover band . tune like speak to me , brain damage and eclipse are okay , at best .
1	what a voice , do not really have to say any more .
0	compared to taylor swift cd , this really suck !
0	i downloaded this mp3 after hearing it in an at & t commercial . i like the song , but the mp3 sound absolutely awful . it is just way too compressed . so it is extremely loud with a very limited dynamic range . almost unlistenable . i honestly do not think you can blame a lot of this on the mp3 encoding . 256 k is a perfectly respectable bit rate , and i have plenty of mp3s that sound fine with lesser bit rate .
1	this song is amazing . it explains how he refuse to live a life that is not holy and acceptable by god . this song is one of those who minister to both the saved and unsaved .
0	bwb is a great collaboration , but this album dropped the ball . every other track is a watered down singing song that doe not rightly fit in any genre . the others are fairly consistent with bwbs usual work . i am not sure what intent for that wa , but the next album need to be smooth jazz through and through , not this .
1	love this song !
0	i hate you i hate you i hate you . i had a credit and i tried to use it for two song . they got sent to 2 different folder . now it say the download took too long . and i lost my $ and the song . you stink , amazon . make it easier to spend my own damn money . thanks .
1	this a great cd by two great artist . it is pure country , both vocal and the music are outstanding .
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
0	this is by far the worst christmas album i have ever heard . sound like he wa drunk when he recorded this . even if someone gave this to me i would not want this in my collection .
1	beautiful !
1	old school excellence
1	good song
0	horrible . do not buy it . i would rather suck puke through a straw . this is the worst song i have ever heard . yuk .
1	i mean seriously , if you do not know and love this song , you either should not be listening to the door or something is wrong with you . i know it college music these day , but all the same .
0	misleading name- the name of this song should be changed . putting ( basement tape ) on it is not sufficient to distinguish it from the famous version . a real disappointment when looking for the popular version .
0	could not download it .
0	if one look at review for most album they are usually positive- even for some of the least regarded artist and album . i do not know how to account for that . it may be that in today market most people can preview an album before they buy it so they are not likely to end up with something they do not like , unlike in time past . i received this album a a gift . this group ha a unique sound for our current time and harks back to many musical tributary of american popular music- soul , r & b , rock . folk etc . like ccr in the late 60 they are staking out a musical territory that most artist ignore and for that alabama shake deserves credit and attention . this group also grab your attention in that it is a white band fronted by a black woman playing guitar- which is unusual , to be frank . this band ha a lot going for it and this album is very atmospheric , but unlike ccr this album is tuneless . in fact i found it drudgery trying to get through the whole thing for a listen- i have listened to it twice . not sure if i can do it one more time , but i will , because i always try to give something new a few listens to see if it will grow on me . i really want to like this group , but so far nothing attracts my ear or stick in my head . i will come back to update this review if it grows on me .
0	what a horrible song to write about the awful deed you did . innocent child were involved ! the lyric are atrocious . i know that because i read them online . you can never understand a word this woman say .
1	fantastic ! possibly his best album yet
1	this is by far the best collection of rare earth there wa . i say wa co it look like at the writing of this that it is now out of print. ( sad ) . luckily i do own it . what make this the best one of all is the inclusion of every now and then we get to go on down to miami . this song wa never released a a single but should have been . every song on here is a winner , you have got the hit and the best of ( almost ) album track . but if mowtown happens to read this please . please release the entire catalog using 24 bit , these guy deserve it . since there is 2 or 3 original member gone now .
0	it did not work like i thought it would to guide u a we accended to the top of pike peak . we had trouble downloading this item .
1	my own personal misgiving with this album upon listening - and miss evancho is just blessed with the voice of an absolute angel - is that in my book , little girl can not be taken seriously with any comfort when they sing of thing beyond their scope of experience . not that i would want an album of tune about pony and rainbow and girl scout cookie sale . but when a barely-teenaged kid sings the word love in any context other than discussion of her stuffed animal collection , i get a bit of the heebie-jeebies .
1	this song of epic proportion broke my understanding of modern philosophy and created it anew . it instilled in my heart such wonder that i can not even write in word how wonderfully wonderful it truly is . gangnam style not only fill your entire soul ( yes the entire soul ) with delight but also brings in a somber tone saying , everythings alright . that tone form in the back of my mind every time i hear this prodigy of true music to enlighten the soul . it keep whispering in my ear , go on , go over , you can do it . just a little longer . this song eclipse all other work of music , nay work of art in the world today ! beethoven would be proud , but he is dead . keep on gangnam , keep on !
1	this is a great 1957 session by the jimmy smith trio and lou donaldson . a fine clollection of bebop & ballad that display excellent communication between these two giant + eddie mcfadden on guitar and donald bailey on drum . from the opening swinging salvo of soft wind to the closing track of early latin bebop in the form of cha-cha , this gem of an album is a not to be missed audio treat . once again , great & rare music like this is only available a an import-although now you can get it in the form of the box set jimmy smith : eighteen classic albums-which i purchased for about $ 20 . i am so glad that the market across the pond is making these classic session of jazz available & affordable for those who like timeless music such a this one by jos & papa lou-who still today blow circle around those much younger & more acclaimed ( by the critics/experts ) than he .
0	very disappointed in this version and not worth the money look for a more traditional rendition of this song song
0	wow , another album from brmc where they can not decide what kind of music they want to make : rocker or slow , drawn out ( and imo dull ) folk song . i really liked war machine & aya . those i bought and enjoyed . i will be glad to never hear any of the other track ever again : )
0	the song is not the type of song i like . the song lack of energy . i think it is not fun to sing too .
0	i thought this wa sung my dottie rambo , did not like it since it wasnt . i wa after hers not someone el .
0	i wa looking for strictly disney song to be played by string , no singing . the music sample clip are mis-leading because the song color of the wind , a whole new world and beauty and the beast all had terrible singer singing along . i do not understand why it is 101 string ochestra and then singing for a few of the song . it feel like there were some singer that loved these song and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental . those three song were what made me purchase this cd . had i known there would be terrible singer singing along to the music , i would not have bought this cd . the music for all of the other song are really nice though ; they are what i wa looking for . listening to a whole new world right now make me want to gouge out my eye ; singer sing at such a slow pace and it sound like they are amateur singer at the local karaoke .
0	weak vocal , weak instrumental . they clearly have lowered the key for several song yet joseph sound like he is straining . he sound like he is lying on his back with a collapsed lung . where is the donny osmond version that i love ? other version of this soundtrack are 5 star . this one is terrible .
0	a many people may know by now , sony wa recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased cd ( van zant : get right with the man ) from sony music not only installed drm software ( digital right management , to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain device ) , but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from window , and opened the system up to security issue such a virus . this cd ha the same copyright protection , called xcp . when installed , sony hijack your computer and installs custom software which : 1 ) hide itself entirely from window by installing a a rootkit 2 ) hide itself in such a manner that any file begining with $ sys $ are also hidden . for example , if you install the xcp copy protection software on your machine , and rename document.doc to $ sys $ document.doc it then becomes invivisble to you forever . 3 ) installs it own custom cd-rom driver to hijack your system . it also sneakily name these driver plug and play device manager to seem a if it is a part of window . trying to delete these driver manually will disable your cd-rom drive entirely . 4 ) offer no uninstall option until you manually contact sony a of my writing this review , sony ha apologized for this incident , and claim they will re-evaluate this copyright protection software on their cd in the future . in the meantime , a virus is currently running wild , which name itself begining with $ sys $ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanner . several class action lawsuit are also pending against sony right now . in summary , a you can tell from above , sonys action here are absolutely horrible . this is your music . you purchased it , and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it , let alone install software which compromise your system security . this is one of the cd with sonys xcp copyright protection software on it , and a a result , you should not buy it to send a message to sony that this will not be tolerated in the future .
1	my son came to me one day with tear in his eye playing this song on his phone . he said he only had one request of me , dad , promise me that if i should pas before you that you will play song at my funeral . well what could i say but , only if you will do the same for me son . very touching day for u . thanks guy .
1	love the message and the music !
1	a golden oldie for sure
0	this is not the version that you are looking for . have not found the version sung on ondine yet . dang it !
1	his voice is tempered with gravel , but the word are still magic . the album only get better with a few listening . he ha been missed , and this may be one of his last work , but it wa worth the wait .
1	great song to work out to ! love it . inspiring !
0	i ordered this twice and both time the record would skip , like it wa warped . it did not look like there were any scratch .
0	very poor album . there is a lacking of instrument , basic drum . very unsophisticated .
0	i could not get more than half way through really boring book . not only wa it boring but it jumped around in time between chapter . drove me crazy . begin 30 year ago then jump to present then back to 1822 to present back to 1822 back to present . the only thing keeping me going to the half way point wa waiting for something to happen . it never did so i gave up .
1	this is a beautiful album inside and out . from the moment the package arrives- it is such a beauty to behold- the packaging immediately take you on a journey and then you put the album on and it is such an awesome experience . transporting , timeless , exciting , meditative , beautiful , just so many quality wrapped up into a wonderful musical experience . so much to enjoy & to go back to and re discover
0	i am a huge matisyahu follower , and listen to ever other album he ha released cover to cover on a regular basis it seems like . i will keep it simple , this is what happens when amazing unique artist go pop and mainstream . i like the song sunshine a lot , but the others just seem so bland and padded up with beat and effect . it is pretty depressing i am writing this review right now .
0	i love this album , but this get 2 star . it would be great if one time i would get a record from amazon that did not skip at all . last two i have purchased have had bad skipping spot .
0	offensive and should not be a part of the free christmas line up . what were you thinking amazon ?
0	nothing wrong with ac/dc a a band but a another reviewer pointed out it hasent changed in like 30 year so any live set you go to see or buy by ac/dc ha the same setlist save two or three new one to support the album they are touring behind . for me this tends to get boring and if you buy one live set by this band it is all you need . well maybe two , if you want blood from the bon scott era and one of the brain johnson era live disc . they still perform well but hearing the same song over and over on every boxet , hit package or live album get boring .
0	it s scratched and my fault that i am too late to return it , the cut off date wa oct. 18. we were gone for 3 week and 2 that were in a row . if i can still return it , please let me know , a i would certainly change my review . josh groban is wonderful .
1	amazing album !
0	a nice album comprised of 12 track which have already been published under the how-the-west-was-swung series by wr record ( vol . 1 through 10 ) . very little information transpired by the time the album wa announced for release , may be to leave potential buyer under the impression this wa a new album rather than a best-of compilation . if you have bought the wr record series , you do not necessarily need this album .
0	this is a pirated recording from a mono copy of the lp . it is complete with tic and pop . the sound is terrible with distortion in the fortissimo part of the recording . i thought i wa getting a good copy from the original master tape and wa very disgusted with the sound . my worn cassette copy wa much better . i would give it a zero for the rating if i could . the performance is wonderful and exciting , but badly mangled by the transfer . do not buy this under any circumstance . instead look for the original rca cd . this should have been properly labeled a aad mono .
0	yikes , who knew the celt were such big fan of synthesizer ! this christmas enjoy all the soul-less expression of elevator music without the elevator . oh , and remember , it is free so you have to like it .
1	oreskaband is a great third wave ska band . unlike most third wave ska band , they have a clear clean sound . they do not blend in other style of music like punk or metal . this is not similar to early ska or the two-tone era ska . it is too peppy and energetic . this album is good clean fun . i can not tell you what the song are about because i speak no japanese . there is only one song completely in english . most song are in japanese with a couple of line in english and a title in english . the only downside is that the album is only 22 minute long .
1	i still do not know what this song is about , but there is certainly some african queen tribalism going on in the song . the tune is catchy and the lyric are powerful . if you do not believe me , watch the video .
1	great song !
1	if you like chicago & like christmas music , this is the cd for you .
0	this band wa my religion and my law for year . that began to decline when i started feeling fleeced by the incessant release of live album and dvd a well a very disappointing album . i believed thunder in the sky could have been a turning point but then the battle hymn rehash happened . now this . eric adam doe not sing lyric , it sound like he is saying them . he is the only thing that delivered on every album and this is extremely disappointing from the best vocalist in metal . hamzigs drumming is fine . it is nice to hear him perform something other than bh song . i never thought i would say this but karl logan guitar work doe not bother me on this album . it is simple and get the job done no silly flashy playing like he usually doe . dare i say he may finally be playing with some sort of feeling ? one of the few strong point of this album . it pain me to say that since he wa a jerk when i met him . ok time to hurt someone feeling . demaios bass sound like a synthesizer or using a slide to play the note . it is pretty bad and annoying . every song it sound the same . i am dumbfounded over this awful sound and it demand an explanation . is this his attempt at dub step ? it certainly is not the true metal sound . the overall production reminds me of electronic dance music where they switch channel for an interesting speaker or headphone experience . one thing edm ha that this album doe not is heavy bass . seriously . if you are going to attempt doom metal ( black list ) . you need that deep bass . sorry . put away the picolo bass if you wanted to evolve . not so many song about viking ( which should be left to amon amarth ) and it kind of reminds me of sign of the hammer album lyric ( i can never forgive all men and small boy and if someone could explain bigfoot bigfoot caught in a well . please ) . soth is an awesome album and this is not . at time they remind me of dr. sue rhyme ( which of course is what rap music is like ) . the only standard manowar formula thing this album is missing is a song about a harley . maybe he lost that word among the refrigerator magnet used to construct the lyric of this album ? let u take a look at each song : the lord of steel : start off like a dr. sue rhyme but ha musical moment . lazy lyric writing . poor opening song to an album . manowarriors : again ha musical moment but we heard these lyric before . another disappointment . i expected a good anthem like warrior of the world . nope . born in a grave : finally some lyric and music that are different , not a bad song but the mixing is ridiculous and ruin it . at this point i ask , why is not eric singing ? righteous glory : first mention of odin on the album . it would have been nice to use erics vocal better on this one . he can sing so let him . i wonder if he wa sick the day they recorded this album ? touch the sky : the bass is ridiculous on this song . it is like an incessant hum of tone and that is a shame because this is one of the better song on the album . like i mentioned , demaios bass playing demand an explanation . black list : attempt at doom metal that fall flat . humming bass that sound like edm . drumming could have been heavier a well . lyric are not good and vocal sound pro-tooled . this song could have been very good . expendable : a pathetic , sad attempt at trying to get a song on a soundtrack to a movie that will make a lot of money . this is the type of song that requires a 80 movie fight training montage to support the ridiculous lyric that eric simply recites . an incredible loss of power in his voice . did something happen to his voice that i do not know about ? el gringo : this is a silly song that sound like a taco bell commercial . head for the border . annihilation : dr. sue rhyme . 1980s atari activision video game sounding bass . pro-tooled vocal . disgraceful . hail kill and die : now that they have hailed and killed for year it is time to die . duly noted . channel switching guitar riff is so incredibly cheesy but what is worse is that this is another effort where they take their own song and album title and arrange them in a paragraph . the chorus sound like frat boy attempting to be tough guy at a metal show where they are clearly out of place . really douche chill inducing . the kingdom of steel : a boring lullaby that sound like something kamelot could cover and would do a much better job . even if i wasnt a former fan this is a crap metal album in general . i hate i did not download it for free before purchasing it . this is more of a novelty act like steel panther and there are better band in the true metal genre . i am sure their european live show are amazing but demaio really need to take a step back with the studio album . anytime a band creates it is own studio the music suffers . much like metallica ha sucked since cliff burton died , this band is not the same since ross the bos . i have a feeling he kept demaios ego in line until he could not take it anymore . technology ha ruined this band . they used to be proud of plugging in and just playing . that formula still work and i wish demaio would remember those time . i really want to love this band again . he need put aside the ftw i will do what i want attitude or getting so butt hurt he threatens to blow everyone onstage with loudness or doing some hailing and killing , blah blah blah . but you can not argue with crazy . some people believe the earth is flat and they will never be convinced . maybe in 20 year he will remake this album too ?
0	i think it is a shame that they have their friend writing review suggesting that they sound anything like lacuna coil or echo of eternity . this is by far the worst cd i have gotten in a long time , and the first that made me write a review . the singer may be the worst i have ever heard . even my cat cd sound better . i am very bitter about the $ 15 i gave away for this awful attempt at gothic music .
1	honestly , i wa never a huge fan of this song , the guy voice always seemed kind of whiney to me , but recently my husband mentioned that he love this song , one of his favorite , he think it is really romantic etc . . . . not the kind of thing you might hear very often from my hubby so i decided to buy a good copy of it and surprise him with a mix cd for valentine day . i have always known the lyric were romantic , but they have more meaning for me now . also , this digitally remastered version is way better than the other cheaper version . his voice doe not bother me now . just go to show how important recording quality really is .
1	love the music ! great interesting , sound well
1	dancing music from flo rida . ha song lyric right round taken from an older song . so if you liek the older song , this one ha a modern twist , hip hop .
1	who can explain god love ? well , hallorin doe a great job . this song touch my soul and brings tear to my eye every time i listen to it . although we mess up , god clean u up and restores u . his love is not of this world . hallelujah !
1	here is another release from a band that had been dormant for year , so here is the verdict : monotheist is just pure greatness . i wa never a fan of the experimental side of celtic frost , and while there is some experimentation in here to a greater degree , it all work organically to achieve some scary result . the album is also full of slow , crushing riffing akin to their morbid tale debut , which make monotheist one of the heaviest experience you will ever come across . the song are lengthy and repetitious and that is what make them effective . while it is hard to classify this opus , it is safe to say that it is a doom metal album . there is a lot of stuff going on , it never get boring . listen deep into the music and you will find something new by each listen . tom vocal are harsh , brutal and mysterious , and the production is exceptional . great comeback album , i give my respect to frost for such a masterpiece . one of the best album of 2006 so far !
1	good
0	i wa so excited that slug and murs were teaming up with aesop for the 3rd felt release ! i have only listened to it about 3 time , but my first impression were of disappointment . one of my favorite aspect of the felt series is they were great from beginning to end ; this thing ha me skipping track and still not impressed . i am a huge fan of felt and hopefully it will grow on me , but this is definitely the weakest of the three and is more awkward than entertaining . there is a ton of talent in this trio , but it just doe not mesh in this album .
0	this sounded like something that someone just threw together . i could not use any of it and none of the song were complete .
0	this is blasphemy , pure and simple . to degrade the precious holy scripture in this manner is to degrade our savior .
0	i bought ti for my son who is a music major . he loved it
0	i do not know if it is amazon fault , but it seems like the sound mixing on the mp3 is bad . too much treble , muddy in the midrange , and the bass is lacking , or maybe it is just overshadowed by the treble . listening to this track on my regular speaker doe not normally make my ears- literally , not figuratively- hurt . i am so thankful for program like audacity ( sound manipulation program ) so i can balance it out myself , but i should not have to .
0	i just finished downloading ( from the cloud ) and there is a problem . four of the track will not play on window medium player or on winamp ( on a window xp system ) . the bad track are : ( disc 1 ) track 04 ( disc 1 ) track 08 ( disc 2 ) track 10 ( disc 2 ) track 13 if i try to open them in window medium player , nothing happens ; the name doe not even appear in the playlist . if i try to open them in winamp , then ( disc 1 ) track 01 ( canon ) play instead ! i believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long . window will not even let you rename them in the normal way . update : i have found a workaround to the file problem , which is listed at the end of this review . * also : several of the track are not relaxing , imho . for example , disc 1 track 9 ( violin sonata ) ha several passage that become quite loud and full of angst . not relaxing to me . disc 2 track 4 ( ballade no . 1 ) ha several section that are quite loud and heavy-handed , and a section near the end that is quite agitated . disc 2 track 10 ( sonata for two piano ) begin quietly , but ha several passage that become quite loud and aggressive . disc 2 track 16 ( minuet in g ) ha a few section that are downright bombastic , with the piano hammering out the bass line in octave while the orchestra play fortissimo . indeed , classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific . but the selection on this pair of mp3 disc seems to be quite erratic . to point out just one glaring example : where is brahms lullabye ? buy this a a general sampler , if you like . but do not expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it is finished . * file repair solution a i suspected , the problem is the excessive length of the file name and path ( the entire route that the computer take to get to the file ) . window allows a maximum of 255 character for the path + name . by default , when you download these , amazon will put them in this path : c : \documents and settings\all users\documents\amazon\various artists\a collection of the most relaxing classical music in the universe\ that is 135 character right there , which leaf 120 character for the track name . now let u consider the name of one of the non-functional file : ( disc 2 ) 10 - sonata for two piano in f minor , op . 34b_ ii . andante , _un poco adagio_ - sonata for two piano in f minor , op . 34b_ ii . andante , _un poco adagio_.mp3 that is 165 character . so the total is 135 + 165 = 300 character , well over the 255-character limit . window just can not handle that ! a a workaround , after you have downloaded all the file , navigate to the folder a listed above . temporarily rename the folder something very short , like xyz ( without the quotation mark ) . that is 65 character shorter than the original file name . now the total are under 255 character , so window will let you rename the individual file . go through and chop out all the duplicate information . in the example given above , you will cut out 72 character , leaving a total of 93 character . do this for all the track . finally , if you want , you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable , like relaxing classical music which will give you a total length of 94 character . if you add the new file name ( from the example above ) which is 93 character , you will see that you end up with a total of 187 character , well under the 255 character limit . of course one wonder : why did not amazon think about this , and use a reasonable album name , and file name without duplication , in the first place . my conclusion : given that at least four of the track are not relaxing , and you will have to spend at least 15 minute screwing around to fix the file naming error , imho this collection just is not worth the trouble , even if it is free to begin with . of course if you are really hard up for music that is maybe relaxing . go for it . personally , i think amazon could and should do a better job . i know i would , if i worked for them .
0	i downloaded this song based on the clip , without having any knowledge that there is a spoken-word ending that contains a racial slur . the spoken word portion ha a good point that i agree with overall , but it render this song unplayable in my household . i wish i could return an mp3 . i am utterly , utterly furious that this did not contain an expletive warning . i now have serious doubt about downloading other song from amazon without being able to preview them in their entirety .
0	this is the lowest form of music . it is following a predictable and waning formula . i have listened to too much amazing pop music for the basic hook to grab me . i have listened to too much great trumpet music for the gimmick of the trumpet to entertain me .
0	disappointing
0	this is the most overrated , overhyped , overpraised , annoying band in history ! the intense praise this band get is downright sickening . how can anybody honestly think that nirvana saved rock n roll ? if you ask me , nirvana , and any other grunge band for that matter , is about a far from being a rock and roll band a anybody can get . rock and roll is supposed to be fun , catchy , toe tapping fun . in the 70 and 80 , just about all rock music wa about entertainment ! it felt good to listen to ! life wa good ! but then in 1992 along came nirvana with their angst ridden suicide music , and rock wa never really the same again . everybody wa miserable . nobody had any fun any more . if a band showed even the slightest sign of having a good time , then that band wa cheesy and stuck in the 80 . stuck in the 80 ? well , if making music for entertainment purpose only , and not using it a an outlet to whine about your personal problem is an 80 thing to do , then the 80 is where i want to stay ! grunge make you feel like killing yourself . in the 90 i used to like grunge , and i went through a period of severe depression . but in 99 i took all my nirvana , pearl jam , soundgarden , and alice in chain cd and i burned them ! and then i spent the rest of the afternoon grooving to arena rock band ! and my depression instantly disappeared ! i wa finally happy for the first time in 3 year , and i owe it all to ditching my grunge cd . i do not recommend nirvana or any other grunge band to anybody . grunge is the most depressing music in the world , and basically just encourages you to hang yourself . it cause depression and suicide ! do not poison your mind with this morbid garbage ! stay away from grunge !
0	i never received my download it would never go to the music on my phone i want my money back bc i bought two copy of the song
0	if you like betty boop and fancy the idea of her singing soft ballad you will love this stuff . me . not so much .
1	i fell in love with this song on ghost ship . i had to do some research to find the actual song , a it is not on the album , but i am glad i found it . it is so pretty , and the singer ha a beautiful voice .
0	i do not have the download . help guideline not working , the cancel button wa hit immediately but account still charged , please credit my account
0	i wa in my twenty when i first listened to this album . it made a very poor impression then , but i thought i would go back and take another look some decade later . this trio creative contribution to the band during jim morrison tenure were undeniably inspired : ray manzareks unique , soulful , creative keyboard rendition , robby kriegers classical-level guitar playing and superb songwriting ability , and john densmores understated but beautifully supportive drumming provided the core for arguably one of history greatest rock band . what i expected from these guy , particularly from the depth of their grief over their friend death - from such sadness often spring the most heartfelt form of creativity - wa an impressive , soul-chilling outpouring of creative spirit . robbie krieger , after all , wrote some of the door most popular piece , and while ray singing ability wa pretty questionable , he and the others were still exceptional musician who could plumb the gold in most song . i wouldve expected the song by and large to sound distinctly doorsian - if not in ray vocal , at least in the instrumentals and structure and basic mood of the song . this is what i expected . what i received wa a collection of song that to my ear sounded like a garage band on a bender . instead of an outpouring of creative angst from the depth of their artistic soul , their lyric , and melody sounded astonishingly , mind-blowingly , banal - lacking even the faintest trace of the rich , subversive , haunting melody and lyric that were the door at their gloomy gospel best . even their song title practically scream low-brow mediocrity ( i am horny , i am stoned ? seriously ? ) listening to this album , i can not believe anyone , not knowing who these guy were , would recognize anything doorsian about them . despite appearance , this review is not about bashing the surviving member of the door ; they provided far too much pleasure for me a a young man - and still do - to regard them with anything but the deepest respect and gratitude . for me this is about solving a mystery : how could people who wrote or collaborated on some of rock best song have produced something so devoid of creative merit ? my best theory so far is that jim morrison contributed something well-beyond his songwriting skill and even his incomparable vocal . i believe that contribution wa most fundamentally to serve a a focus for his bandmates creativity ( he may also have imposed a clearly much-needed discipline , by rejecting mediocre melody and lyric ) . something about morrison , i think , drew out the best in krieger , manzarek , and densmore . and perhaps morrison simply would not accept anything but the best from his bandmates . perhaps more than anything , he provided a clear and stellar vision of what they were about musically - a fertile world where their musicality could flourish . i have little doubt that if you placed a young , hungry jim morrison in front of these guy even now that something wonderful would result . i believe the post-morrison album vividly demonstrate that jim wa more than his stage antic , a pretty face , goosebump-producing voice , and even a songwriter : he wa a primal , creative force - a dionysus to his bandmate maenad . with him , they were a holy , orgiastic force ; without him , they were merely drunken creature stumbling blindly through the forest .
0	eh more fluff than substance
0	what is the most annoying about this set is in fact the amount of material that wa left off . i understand it wa a daunting task to make a compilation of this magnitude . but come on people . by calculation if you add up all the blank space at the end of each cd you end up with almost an hour of unused space . to leave track such a take it away/ballroom dancing/tug of war/c moon/vanilla sky/helen wheels/bluebird etc off wa just inexcusable .
0	i buy the song but they never let me download it into my computer
1	i have hundred of xmas , am a dylan fan & read all the review here & wanted to add i love this cd . i agree with all the detail in the 5 star review & will not repeat them , but what stand out is the sincerity & classic feel of the arrangement here . it is warm & glowing like a warm fireplace & dylan raspy voice add the spice & crackling of the log . for me , this cd feel like xmas a much a sinatra , manilow or bing . unlike other big name star who make the obvious xmas collection , dylan somehow wa able to create a standard that make me want to play it over & over . definitely a keeper , from left field to center stage .
1	i bought this album on vinyl when it wa first released [ 1972 ] . do is malos second album and ha le vocal content than their brilliant first album titled malo [ which i also highly recommend ] , but once again malo prove what fine musician they are with the amazing sound of the spanish trumpet often in the lead and , a always with malo , there is an ensemble of latin percussion . each of the six long track provides intense listening , if you can manage to sit still that is , many of the rhythm and beat invite body movement . the opening track momotombo set the pace of the whole album with almost every instrument & certainly every band member giving it their all , followed by the lively oye mama , about a latin american a you can get . somewhere on a malo album there ha to be a love song & i am for real say it nicely , then the hauntingly beautiful flute piece midnight thought give u a special treat . the tribal sounding chant hela take u back to the primitive , before the final nine & a half minute crescendo latin bugaloo sum up all this band are about . if you are already into malo and you like to collect original album you will not go wrong adding this one to your cd library . the musicianship is remarkable . i can not praise it enough .
0	um . no .
1	the band perry is amazing and i think this is their best song yet . followed closely by hip to my heart ! listen to this song once and you are hooked !
1	one of my big draw to this movie is the soundtrack . the main theme is catchy and beautiful at the same time . however , a opposed to many music only soundtrack where the main theme is great and the rest is just background sound , the music here is strong throughout the cd ( and the movie ) . in addition to the main theme , the excitement of the brumbie chase is another personal favorite . it is pretty simple : if you are a big fan of the movie , you will highly enjoy this sound track . if you like great western themed or classical music and have never seen the movie , you will also like this soundtrack . strongly recommended .
1	love this cd ! the message is great and the music make you want to dance ! this particular song ( beautiful ) is a song every person , especially young woman , should hear and heed .
0	i wa out christmas shopping today and the store i wa in wa playing this cd in the background . when i went to purchase my item i heard the store manager talking with a worker standing behind me . the manager asked what music they were playing and the worker responded the new jessica simpson christmas cd . i heard the manager then reply can you please stop the music , it is scaring the customer and it is really bad for business . i wa so enthralled and fascinated at this point i had to find out why the store manager made that comment and why she wa so insistant that they cut the cd off . i went online later and listened to happy christmas and found out myself why . it wa truely awful . i am sorry i do not want to hear jessica simpson singing christmas carol when it sound like she needed to blow her nose every song . jessica simpson is just a strange creature . why doe she continue to make music ? it really tell me something when there is only 12 review on here . plus she date athlete . creepy .
1	california love the greatest song of all time why everybody go to cali it is mostly the west coast , a for me florida is almost like california , i live in orlando which is mostly part of central florida . especially all part around the sunshine state .
1	to all who have destructively criticized jewel latest album , 0304 , take notice that all artist : writer , actor , musician , painter , etc. , etc , have to constantly change in order to stay afloat in an industry not noted for high survival rate . artist like jewel have to project different image twenty-four seven , whether it is their look and/or work . moreover , change can sometimes be difficult to accept , but that is life . nothing stay the same , everything change . however , that is how the entertainment business operates too . artist are product , pawn , of an industry that control their every move . just enjoy the music and have fun !
0	god , what a letdown this wa . people in the global internet nirvana worshiping community were foaming at the mouth for this thing for month , until they saw the tracklisting - the original record , b-sides that every already ha , the smart studio tape that everyone already ha ( and is not that good ) and a live cd that everyone already ha . then they got real bummed when they heard it and realized it wa brickwalled in the mastering stage , meaning , a someone else ha already explained , compressed to hell so everything is the same volume ( loud ) and it hurt your ear , getting rid of many aural detail in the process . no doubt , the boombox rehearsal tape and the devonshire mix were tantalizing . i wa really hoping for the devonshire mix to deliver , a butch mix of breed on with the light out is killer . however , they are kind of all over the place , which i suppose one should expect for rough mix - some drum are too loud ( lithium ) , some too buried in the mix ( breed , territorial pissing ) , etc . i wanted to love them , but overall i do not . i do prefer the vocal on there , a they actually sound like vocal and not wrapped in plastic , and the bass sound like a bass . people who are seriously into engineering seem to have problem with the different sound of the drum . it is nothing i notice though . also , if you wan na see hardcore nirvana fan get really pissed off , google sound city sappy . in the end , the boombox tape is definitely the gem here . much better quality than i wa expecting and it ha never been circulated in any form anywhere . really interesting stuff to see the band developing these monster song in a time that would , in retrospect , be the calm before the storm . it is that much-fabled last innocence period . now to get at what you receive in exchange for your money - four cd , a dvd and a hardcover book for $ 109- $ 130+ , depending where you got ( get ) it . with the light out is currently around $ 40 here and you get three cd , a dvd and a softcover book . both have substantial packaging . with the light out had way more unreleased stuff on it , like most of it . all of disc one and part of disc two on the other hand , ha been released commercially . disc four replicates the dvd , which again , ha been available a a high-quality audio bootleg since time immemorial . plus , all the live b-sides are from this show , so those song appear three time on the set - what ? anyway , you can buy the deluxe for $ 20 and the dvd for $ 16 or so . what do you miss out on ? not much . not much . seriously , why have not more people reviewed this thing to spread the truth ?
0	not the same sound a the original version . sound like a different singer ! yuck .
1	great
0	occasional ( just a few but enough to keep you awake if you are trying to drift off ) popping noise and brief second where there is no sound occasionally . only found this with his recording and i have not tried them all . wish i could return this purchase a i will not be listening again . : /
1	leon cut up , adding his own flair to some classic hank williams country tune . the version on here of tumblin tumbleweed alone is worth the price of the album . also , you get to hear his more straight up distinctive voice singing rather than the really gravelly , stylized singing style on many of his recording ( not that there is anything wrong with that ! ) it is just a refreshing change for his fan .
0	this cd wa terrible . and not just because he is using other artist music , and seemingly getting away with breaking the law ( for now ) . being that he is making a profit with this being sold on amazon . it is terrible because it is not well done . the transition are terrible . most of the song do not have any relevancy from song to song . where is the theme ? it is closer to a 10 second clip sample on random shuffle . i thought people who liked crap like lil wayne , souljah boy , justin beiber , or any name from a slew of non-talented performer who seemed to sell million of record , were in bad taste musically . this cd take that to a whole other level .
0	condition wa stated acceptable . hardly listenable .
0	. some of you may wish to buy this chicago album because , foolishly like me , you want to listen to the music and song of the guy in chicago , but you get to listen to the composition of : 1- dannay orton , 2- blair daly , 3- greg barnbill , 4- dennis matkosky , 5- chas sandford , 6- jay demarcus , 7- brett james , 8- george hawkins jr. , 9- marcus hummon , who are not in the band . with only 1 song ( out of 12 ) written entirely by a band member , apparently either the band are no longer capable of making music or the producer think so . if you , foolishly like me , buy this album to hear the band play , you have to listen to : 1- lee thornberg : trumpet , 2- james matchack : keyboard , 3- jay demarcus : keyboard , 4- tom bukovac : guitar , 5- dan huff : guitar , 6- dean deleo : guitar , 7- yankton mingua : guitar , 8- jack kincade : guitar , 9- jay demarcus : guitar . 10- steve brewster : drum , 11- john brockman : drum , and listen to the vocal of : 12- shelly fairchild , 13- rascal flatts , 14- gary levox , 15- jay demarcus , 16- joe don roony , 17- bobby kimball 18- joseph williams ; so in the eye of mr jay demarcus , the producer of this album , allegedly by chicago , 16 additional musician and 9 song writer were necessary to do the job that the band themselves were , in his eye , incapable of doing ! jay demarcus himself ha played guitar , and key , a well a treating u to some singing . i am glad he had some fun , but i wa not paying to hear him and his other 15 friend he called to the party at the expense of chicago . if i had wanted to listen to all those other 25 people i would have asked for their name in the shop , not ask for chicago . is it too much to ask to be listening to chicago music when we get a ` chicago cd ? i am not referring to the quality of music here , which is purely a matter of personal taste but , good or bad , i wanted to listen to chicago . i do not mind if i do not like the song , a long a it is their music . but apparently , in the eye of the producer and financier of this album , there is not a viable chicago anymore which they can trust to write and record it own music ; only a name to milk . a they did with chicago 19 and 21 , but far worse this time . i do not mean to offend the taste of those who find the music on this cd pleasant enough to enjoy it ; i do however mean to offend that faithless producer , jay demarcus , who ha made an art of mediocrity and lack of vision , and ha offended the band by showing clearly that , a their producer , he belief that the composition and playing of all those other musician would somehow be better for the album than that of the chicago themselves . his treatment of keith in particular is almost unbelievable : 6 guest guitarist ? he ha not let keith play on at least 9 of the song ! and he ha not let tris play drum on 4 of the song ! this is a joke . not sure how mr demarcus can say he is proud of the boy ! he seems to me to be ashamed of them and prefer to hide and burry them under the work of others . if he wa proud of them he would not disempower them in this fashion and make a sad joke of them on their last album . but the band themselves , whom i had continued to love for decade , should have known better , after a thinking pause of 15 year , what to choose to go out on , and what legacy and memory to leave behind ; cause they are not going to get a chance to do another album after this . a bunch of the usual type ballad , indistinguishable from any out-takes from any of the album from 16 to 21 , written and performed in great part by others , is an unworthy epitaph , for a band that used to be more than just a brand name for a bunch of writer and player to sell their stuff under . conclusion : 1- if you are a fan of the chicago 1 to 7 , entirely avoide this album and save your stomach a lot of churning . 2- if you are a fan of the chicago 8 to 11 , you may find a couple of nice piece here that you might enjoy , such a the one by robert . borrow it from a friend for a listen . 3- if you are a fan of the chicago 12 to 17 , you will find several piece here that you will enjoy very much . worth buying for occasional listening . 4- if you are a fan of chicago 18 to 21 , you are not going to care who made the song and who played them and you will totally love the whole of this album , which is more of the same . it ha some good playing by some people , just the sort of song you enjoyed on those other album , and good production . buy it and love it .
0	i have down loaded this two time . the song doe not work on my computer . i have had similar situation with down loading music from amazon . they have refunded my money sometimes . but-why doe ten song down load & this one doe not !
0	this wa a gift for my daughter for christmas , so i can not review this item
0	while i am a berlin fan , i wanted to go back while listening to these song in the car . i should have read closely - these are not the original . while the are good , they are not the same . time to replace/repurchase with the original .
0	i had no idea what they sounded like , but once i downloaded this song , i thought , what a waste of time ! do not bother unless you are a fan . i am certainly not in any danger of becoming one anytime soon !
0	i agree with the previous post . these three mix should have been available on the cd version . the offer nissim remix is by far the best one available from all the version out there . it is a proper extended dance mix much in the vein of it is a sin or can you forgive her - the glory day when all mix appeared either in vinyl or then cd /cassette form . a cloud in a box is a good b-side track with a techno dub feel a la 80 flavour . say it to me stuart price version is nearly identical to the album version but ha been slowed down so it feel like an acoustic version even though all the instrumentation is there . it is the second-best version of all the remixes .
0	nope no sale here . but i know my daughter like this group .
1	almost a good a liza . my 2nd favorite dance version of this song . or at least upbeat tempo . highly recommend ,
0	wow . i am really disappointed in this . i guess i am just not hearing what others are that seem to enjoy this , but the band sound muddled and uninspired . i get the impression they are going through the motion ( which they are ) and could really care le anymore what they put out . roth sound soooooo bad , it is really embarrassing . and i am still not excited about the set list . it is not that it a bad set list , but they have become a tribute band to themselves considering they choose to ignore 4 album worth of material a if it never happened and virtually ignore the new material from the very album they are supposed to be promoting . so disappointing . back in the day , vh would play 80-90 % of a new album . they were proud of what they did and dying to show it off . there are song on adkot that are just begging to be played live , but i am guessing well never hear em . shame to put this out and not have cut like big river , you and your blue or beat workn on here ( a terribly retreaded and unoriginal a adkot wa , i still enjoyed the release quiet a bit . i play it often and it ha some great song to workout to . to bad most of them will never see the light of day light . what a shame . i will pas . i own about every vh cd that is been released ( had iii , but got rid of it ) . but i will pas on this one . i will still listen to the studio cut ( heck , daves last solo wa pretty good ) , but i will pas on the live money grab thank you very much .
1	i always have . first heard it when it came out . this time i bought it s a gift for someone else .
0	very slick only giving the weeknd a single hook verse otherwise he would have killed this song . very dissapointed do not buy if you are looking for the weeknd
0	nickelback essentially sum up everything that is wrong with the music industry today . what else can i say ? this stuff is so bad it make me go cross-eyed .
1	if you want a variety of beethoven music , this is an excellent selection . beautiful , beautiful music . relaxing , uplifting , moving . it just doe not get any better !
0	full disclosure , i have not listened to this entire album . it wa just too awful . look , the bottom line , this album is 40 year too late . if this ha been released in the 1970s when everyone wa on psyc drug , then i am sure it wouldve been a huge hit . but this is 2014. it just doe not work .
0	i own most lou reed album and all of his now-wife laurie anderson . both are outstanding artist and musician . i knew john zorn only by name before i bought this album . it seems this album series is a benefit for a new york club called the stone . lou reed play electric guitar , laurie anderson violin and john zorn saxophone . the producer obviously told everybody to improvise . if you have ever listened to lou reed metal machine music you know what to expect . the result is essentially white noise - unlistenable . definitely for completists only . and do not bother to pay the elevated price from dealer here . a short internet search will reveal that it is still available from the stone webshop . this limited edition will take some time to sell out .
1	i absolutely love this song which manages to be both depressing in a strangely end of the world kind of way and keep you interested
1	danceable .
1	such a beautiful song
1	excellent single to celebrate the 51th anniversary of the artist that ha been in the top of the chart for the last 25 year . this single keep you moving unless you are dead and did not know it . lol excellent !
0	i liked this song until i watched the video . come on . then robin thicke got twerked on by miley . ugh . while his wife played it cool for a while , eventually she left him . and finally he say he ha addiction issue . am i the only person who can not stand either listening to music or watching movie where the singer/actors personal life interferes with my opinion of the actual song/movie ? ( see : anything by amy winehouse ; all thing brad pitt , gwyneth paltrow or rihanna )
1	a wonderful story about a man trying to help a heartbroken girl he meet in a bar and try to start a conversation with
0	completely different than any of her older album . if you like old rihanna with a pop beat and hard hit , this is not the album for you .
1	i love the arrangement on this collection . many of my favorite easter song with stirring instrumentation . a good collection to have .
1	this is one of my all time favorite song . even if you are not a country music fan i would recommend this song . well worth the price of the mp3 .
0	this is a waste of money . only one track and it is a crappy remix of a great song . i thought it wa the actual cd decade because from the mp3 version of the actual cd amazon directed me to this album . doe anyone know how to give le than one star ? james egbert should go to bed every night knowing that he is a douche just like i do for buying this cd .
1	been wanting to get this song for year after selling my vinyl . have not tested it yet but the download seems to have went smoothly .
0	i wa very excited to locate a jazz version of whitney song a i , m the biggest fun . once the cd arrived i put it on and i wa extremely disappointed . very bad jazz version of the best ever lady singer on earth . i wa so discussed ed i through it in the bin .
0	she did a song in english so you guy can also understand the meaningless thing she ha to say . and this song is the most meaningless she ever did . but her voice sound much stronger . this is not a typical blmchen-song . there are many backgroungsingers and more lyric . there are three song on this single . the radio version , the extended version and the song where heart have wings.it is the english version of her song herzen haben flgel . i think it is on the blossom-album heartbeat
1	love this album . one of his best . if you like this one you will love & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/self-made/dp/b0014567mk/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > self made < /a > from his homie mike jones
1	i had extremely high expectation for mumford & son new album babel after listening to their first release over and over . so not too surprisingly i wa a little disappointed at first . but after a few play through , it grew on me and , while i still believe sigh no more is better album , babel is still a great cd of it own right . i am not a professional reviewer , so i will keep my review brief and just make a list of my favorite track ( in no particular order ) . they are mostly made up of the most up-tempo and catchy song on the album . my favorite track on babel : -babel -i will wait -hopeless wanderer -broken crown -the boxer
0	i wa hoping for something better than this . i have been reading all the rave review and wondering if amazon downloaded a different version for me than the rest . my first impression wa , sale of the 7 string must be down . time to over use it again . i love , love , love vai . i do not love story of light . i can not even give a coherent explanation why at this point . i made it through the first listen and wa thankful that i only spent the money on the download . his tone is brilliant , his playing is still out of this world . i have loved him and his quirky composing since flex able . this one is a miss . though there are some high point , they quickly come down and stay there most of the time . i will not waste our time giving you a song by song review . buy it and judge for yourself .
1	download this but also go to you tube and watch the couple of live performance of this song . this guy ha a real magic to him . his affect on the audience reminds me a lot of jim morrison . he will make eye contact with just one person and for just a moment . but you can tell that that person is not likely to forget that moment .
1	i have this on an lp record and finally found it here . the entire collection is great fun with the monster singing their own song .
0	there is no reason for me to listen to music . it just suck really bad and ha no love in it .
1	pretty good album . love the option to download and get cd for almost the same price
1	good song , love her voice , love the beat put me in a good mood , i downloaded immediately after i heard the song on the radio .
0	not a relaxing music a i though it would be .
1	great
1	i hated their voice at first , and i hated the lyric . but i listened to the whole thing twice , and it actually is kinda catchy . but everyone is different . for example my sister leaf the room when this song come on so it really just depends on how the music ring inside your ear .
0	million of american listen to music on their ipod . try telling that to this record label , which willfully made this cd incompatible with itunes . i do not mind buying music digitally , but i also like to keep a physical copy of the cd for my collection . copy protection doe not give you this option . i am absolutely enraged and i feel like screaming . avoid !
1	this album ha me rocking out to favorite track like carry me back and levi while also cooling down with bob dylan-esque track including aint it enough and the way of man . overall all the banjo and fiddle romp leave me yearning for a blue grass festival .
1	love it
0	i am very disappointed ! the wording on the description claim various artist leading the purchaser to believe that this is a compilation of original 80 artist . it is not ! it is a mix sung by a wedding singer/cruise line type of band . is it even legal for a cd to be published with remake of original artist song without the permission of the original artist ? hopefully this band paid for the right to use these artist song . very misleading and disappointing !
1	it is a good cd
0	this is a horrible arrangement . mr. hecocks begin with a bizarre cowboy theme on all black key that a piano student would learn on his first lesson . this theme is repeated during the recording . what doe a cowboy theme have to do with a worship song . strange .
0	wile i am sure it is just right for some folk , and i like a lot of cajun & zydeco music , this one just did not do it for me . i actually did not keep it . deleted .
0	the worst album i ever purchased wa nevermind . i had expected it to be excellent since nirvana fan recommended it so highly . but i am sorry to say that the cadaverous threesome have let me down . it is hard to listen to more than 3 song at one go ! i found the album to be monotonous & boring . the song are very bad and the vocal are awful .
0	yes , this album should shut up all those that say that steve harris is iron maiden . steve may be the main composer in maiden , but british lion prof that he can not achieve the extraordinary level of an iron maiden album by himself . he doe need the other 5 guy . also , it dissapoints that harris got this singer , richard taylor , for the album . the difference between bruce dickinson and this guy is like the difference between a ferrari and a beat up bicycle . i am not saying bruce should have been on the album , but that steve should have known what fan expected of him and gotten a decent singer . even blaze bailey is a good singer , he did not have the energy and the connection to the fan that a lead singer in iron maiden requires , but blaze bailey can sing . i do not know who told this richard taylor that he could sing !
0	not that great . will
0	never heard this version before ! would have been nice to have been nice if l had been made aware that there wa various artist . this is not even the guy who wrote the song ( cohn ? or cohen ? ) even though llove the song l had to delete this version immediately ! waste of money
0	i wish i could give this 5 star because i really do love the performance on this album . however , the audio quality is seriously lacking on this album . it is a if somebody in the audience recorded it with their iphone . it sound really thin . that and the lack of a cd release and being stuck with a crappy mp3 format , i really can not give it more than 2 star . this performance deserves a better treatment and a proper release .
0	i have a vynil copy of that album , and will not buy the cd , cause there are much better option to waste money ! zipper is a strange album of an artist that wa a great star during the early-mid 70 , but during the disco and the new wave , turned to be irrelevant . his worst album lace and whiskey and zipper are strange experience to make a come-back , but he had to wait few more year . zipper reminds u sometimes the classic alice of love it to death , school out etc. , but it is far from being on the same level .
0	i do not know what version this is but it suck . i like another version of this song i had before but ii am not gon na keep buying them to find it .
1	i have an original promo copy of this unknown gem - from when it wa released . after year of play , i needed a replacement and i found this pristine copy for a very fair price . it arrived sooner than expected and packaged properly for shipment . thanks to amazon and their affiliate .
1	even though the track promise that this is disco , it is really not . it is bright and shiny tech-house . if it is disco you want , ian pooleys hyperdisco remix brings in the appropriate bass riff . dave angel take his own remix funkier but no le shiny . wax doctor , not surprisingly , let the atmospheric dnb blow over the track like a warm breeze . still no disco , but that is fine .
0	if you like the movie you love the soundtrack , i know i did
0	not what i expected and some song so sad i cried .
1	a great follow-up to her award winning duet with jason aldean and her tv show duet , kelly sings with famed country artist vince gill to create a truly lovely song . it is well sung and it keep running through my head . it is one of those hear it one time and know you will buy it song imho . enjoy !
1	after watching the movie secretariat this had to be a part of my playlist .
0	do not download just this song , you only get the tail end when they are singing the do do du dupe part .
0	this album make me sick . it is generic and boring . same stupid drum beat in 90 % of the song . what happened ? way to go guy , you sound like s * . i am clearly upset . i could cry . mumford and son are dead . they should have changed their band name with this album . disgusted . this is sissy music horse s * .
1	perfect
0	very mediocre for a modest mouse album , isaac seems to have lost his touch , or his will to create masterpiece .
0	what ha happened to country music ? i call this crock ! let u get back to the steel guitar and the fiddle and the cheatin and drinkin song that have a story .
0	love this song , but wa very disappointed in how soft the background vocal are . hard to achieve a good blend .
1	great song !
1	i like the music
0	wanted the song with the word . this is just instrumental .
0	please update it to the new national anthem that libya ha now . a after the liberating libya from qaddafi this anthem ha changed
1	i love the brass opening this song . make me want to walk up to my wife and dance .
1	i am sure that the tom wait purist have a specific album or two to suggest , but this one doe the trick for me . i have been more than a casual fan since he appeared on fernwood tonight and sang the piano ha been drinking . tom version of jersey girl ( the original ) can not be beat . the heart of saturday night ? nothing really need to be said . if you want to try tom wait on for size , starting here is not a bad idea . great stuff .
1	i love this cd . every single song . it is one of my all time favorite . i feel like a couple of the song are straight out of my life . highly recommend !
0	what the others say is true . i bought this cd back in the early ninety . i soon discovered it wa nothing but a bootleg cd copied from an lp . no stereo and one song play faster than it should . i have the original mercury stereo lp ( all track were stereo except one ) . just an fyi , the stereo lp version of please do not talk to the lifeguard is a bit different then the released 45 version . you can hear most of the stereo lp song on youtube . search for diane ray stereo .
0	i loose the money awful
0	man i hate getting my hope up only to be disappointed . the hype over this album wa said that it wa supposed to be the best produced album in year by jackyl . that might be true , but the materiel wasnt worth producing well to begin with . there is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh song . not one single song here stick out above the rest a the best song on the album . they all are a mediocre at best rating . nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of jackyls best of . usually i like when jackyl do cover version , but even everyones a winner here is a song that is just meh , not a song i liked before and still do not . the only track that seemed to have anything going for it wa the final one , but then again , how many time is jessie dupree going to try and write the same song ? enough with the rev it up and go already . the same can be said for just because i am drunk . it is just a watered down version of secret of the bottle . i do not get why some have already said rally is a favorite of theirs ? the song sound silly with lyric rally , rally , rally , uga , chugga , ugga chugga . really ? wa this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing ? not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sound out of place together . this album ha failed to rock me , roll me or jackly me off in any way . sure , the production is good , but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish . the attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doe not seem right for jackyl . it sound more like them trying anything to keep current , and thats not why fan stick with them . i have not given up hope , and think jackyl can still bounce back , but they sure are not the same band they once where . they really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of album great . nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a jackyl classic .
1	i absolutely love this singer artist . she ha quite a voice and she delivers in every song she sings . enjoy !
1	love it !
1	one of his best and one of the best holy night version ever done !
1	excellent cd
0	downloaded this thinking it wa something else . not my style of music at all . be sure to preview before purchasing .
0	am sorry i purchased the cd . music is slow a drag . not the usual upbeat christmas music .
1	well , memory , ha a special place in the heart of my sweetheart , and betty buckley simply doe it best !
1	great song , heard it in life is strange
0	this cd ha onley one good song on it do not waist your money on it just go to itunes and buy it what a waist of money
0	why wa the price so low ? all the track are mislabeled .
0	this ha to be the worst holiday song ever made . i can not believe anyone would actually pay for this . i would not even download it for free .
0	in the late 1970s there wa a yes-inspired wannabee band called starcastle . starcastle were goodish , they had a smattering of reasonably widespread album , but they were not in the same league with yes . starcastles arrangement were softer , le articulate , and their lyric were hairy-fairy without ever really getting anyplace . you know , star stuff galaxy and friendly maiden in the mist , but what wa the point ? i regret to say this , but fly from here sound like starcastle . it is yes light . i am glad they are still out there , working on new material . but this is simply not a cd i will be spinning again in preference to almost any other yes album i posse . this is for one of two listener : either the yes completist , or someone who is not acquainted with yes , but who enjoys light , fluffy , spacey , extended pop . just not a great album imo .
1	great great song .
0	company wa great . thought it would be more contemporary music . the cd wa to much blue . depressing at best . others may like it .
1	ballet teacher and their student will love this song . basic dance vocabulary and movement are suggested along with tutu and tiara . a remarkable resource for ballet teacher .
1	the entire cd is greatly composed of real r & b music . scream and emergency are two of my favorite although the entire disc you can play from start to finish and jam . tank music in the past ha always been enjoyable to me but he ha really matured with this cd . the great thing is he did not try to conform to some of the newer antic with his sound , he just stayed true to himself in which i can appreciate . for the lady . tank picture on the inside cover prof to be an extra bonus for u ! lol !
1	this is a strange a project a i can imagine . purportedly bob dylan or his minder find a batch of old lyric from his 1967 basement tape sabbatical and rather than composing/borrowing melody dylan pass the lyric to longtime producer t-bone burnett , an old associate from the rolling thunder revue tour of 1975-6. nor doe burnett complete the song although he is been making his own record since the 1970s . rather he invite other musician to complete the song and several interesting singer accept . musical omnivore elvis costello is probably the best known ( burnett wa a relatively early costello producer ) . burnett claim the record wa conceived and recorded on a very tight schedule in something like a song composing lab , inviting collaboration and making no restriction on which singer could tackle which lyric . costello ha written vast number of elaborate lyric and interpreted many others in numerous genre and understands the craft a well a anyone possibly could . so what attracted him to the project ? my best guess is that he had some assurance he could finish the title cut which is probably the best lyric in the bunch , although rhiannon giddens came up with an equally interesting melody for lost on the river . some of these lyric may have been a bit naughty for the newly married dylan at time . dylan basement tape lyric could be usefully categorized a playfully absurd and dead serious . the serious lyric were more elliptical , open , and allusive than his previous song . the playful lyric often seemed like trucker slang . quite a few of these seem to borrow existing song title but launch into quite different direction . most of these lost lyric lean serious but there are a couple absurd lyric included and those are not successfully assayed in my opinion because none of the singer can approach dylan goofiness . there wa also a cable film tie-in and that film seemed to hinge on the drama of giddens and marcus mumfords songwriting inhibition . no matter , each of these very dramatic singer contribute some of the better track on the record . giddens is obviously a marvelous talent who can choose her future session work on the basis of these recording . jim james of my morning jacket ace all his assignment and even sound a lot like nashville skyline dylan on the opener . taylor goldsmith of dawes is the odd inclusion here because he is a very understated singer compared to the others . instrument are traded in the best basement tape fashion . the record sound nothing like the original basement tape which is probably best . dylan wa the other tie-in when he finally released all the known basement tape in a truly deluxe set which hopefully will result in a more comfortable retirement for the great organist garth hudson who kept the archive all these year .
0	absolutely no information about how to improve your emotional intelligence . an endless dialogue promoting an emotional intelligence course and stating really obvious reason why we need it , for exampl , e because of violent behaviour and condition like eating disorder . a complete and utter waste of money and time . this depressing and boring diatribe may in fact lower your emotional intelligence , but will certainly line the pocket of daniel goleman . do not waste your money on this no-help-whatsover book .
1	the whole album ( cd , mp3 , etc . ) is awesome . spend some jack , get a real bargain , enjoy the sound . ken ooltewah , tennessee
1	first came out in 1980 , a this wa the band second lp . maybe not a masterpiece but pretty decent symphonic progressive title at that . this garden of delight pressing ha an added bonus song . tune i liked best were the title track back on my hill , stick in your eye and the seventeen-minute judgement day . faithful breath had reportedly disbanded after this album came out but keep in mind the band later reformed with two original member - heinz mikus - guitar & vocal and horst stabenow - bass who had recruited a couple of new playes but then moved onto playing heavy metal quite a change - they released several more effort - rock lion ( 81 ) , hard breath ( 83 ) and gold n glory ( 84 ) . check em out .
1	fascinatingly unique . lin manuel ha created something that changed music . i can not stop listening to this album because every time i listen to it , i learn more about not only the music but about race issue and history . can not recommend it highly enough
1	song i grew up with
1	jerry playing wring so much feeling out of every note , and everything he play is so tasteful and rich . yum .
0	i could not download all 930 or so mp3s from the cloud player without clicking them 1 at a time . however , thanks to amazon showing that this resource exists for free , i wa able to find the site bible.is . on that site they have the complete bible , plus they have both dramatized and non-dramatized version of kjv , nasb , esv , and contemporary english . if this product did not need to be downloaded through cloud player , i would have given it a 4/5 star . that is 4/5 not 5/5 because i do not really like the background music .
1	great song !
1	i decided to buy this mp3 download after hearing too close on different commercial and researching alex clare . he is an interesting person with a unique , soulful voice and i figured that this album would not disappoint . this ha been one of the best album that i have ever purchased to date . every song is different but exceptional too , especially hand are clever . hummingbird us a heart-beat like base for the rhythm of the song and pair this beat with a pop-like upbeat chorus , whereas up all night is a rock anthem to evening activity . there is something no this album/cd for every individual and if you purchase this download at $ 5.99 ( which is a steal ) , you will not be disappointed . i promise .
0	i really liked michael grimm voice on america got talent . the cd , however , is a disappointment because that voice is lost in the production . le instrumentation & accompaniment and more michael would have made this an enjoyable listen .
1	memory of bygone day
1	here come the mummy are wonderful ! their music is exceptional , make you want to get up and move . i have missed this kind of music , it is hard to find now day and it is original . the lyric are also very original . they are funny and full of innuendo . if you ever have a chance to see them in person do not pas it up !
0	re-recordings . not the original release .
0	buyer beware , this is only a sample of the track . it is only a 20 second clip . not worth $ 1 !
0	selfies are annoying enough , i do not see why an annoying song wa necessary . the white girl voice in this song is so unbelievably annoying . i want to just smash my headphone . i mean yes , it ha a catchy tune , but it is not the type of song that you spend money on . look up on youtube , watch it once , and then never discus it again .
0	racist
0	oh please . whomever keep saying pearl jam is better than nirvana need to let up . pearl jam is worse than nirvana , yet i despise both . they both sold out . vedder gladly obliged to be a medium puppet , and kurt knew what he wa getting into when he signed with a major . yet kurt still did not care to fufill what wa asked of him . he had always been lazy , and nevermind reflects that . it is pure pop-rock on par with bon jovi , and he refused to admit it . there is no punk sensibility to it at all .
0	not a bad bond title song . but no excuse why this is not on soundtrack cd . adele should be boycotted . barbara should be ashamed of herself causing cubby to roll over in his grave .
1	liz ha had a rough couple of year . with that being said , she ha come out the other side stronger than ever . with more of a blues/rock sound and hard living lyric exodus of venus is her best work to date .
0	a of this writing , many of the track on this album are misnumbered/mislabled .
1	great album
1	saw him on agt , and loved his version of this song . had to buy it ! will hopefully get some other song .
1	great
1	musical perfection from the foo fighter a usual .
1	beautiful voice
1	love this song , so fun . my 9 and 10 year old love it too . we jam out to it in the van .
0	the problem with getting the preview is that they never let you hear the end of song . i do not know whether the people that put the album together thought they needed to shorten the album , but several of the song have the last note or two cut off , either completely or right in the middle of a note . not a lot of joy there . i will say that there are some song on the album that are fine , but getting slammed like that really ruin everything . i will probably go through the album again and remove these song from my device .
0	yikes ! i mean . yikes ! what the ? are they kidding ? is this some kind of weird joke ? i could not wait to place my order for this long awaited live vh album , and i could not have been more excited the day it arrived . i carefully unwrapped it and studied the cool packaging ( no band pic though - very odd ) and let it rip . oh my god . what were they thinking ? this is so freaking bad i think it just turned me off music - period . the drum are sloppy , the guitar are surprisingly sloppy too , the key are lagging behind the band , the bass is solid though , but please , please , please do not even ask about the vocal . this is not the band i know and love . regretfully , i absolutely hate this release .
1	this is one of my favorite old school christmas song . this is a classic .
0	sum 41 ha no talent . they are not skilled by any mean and the lyric are just horrible . if you want something close to decent in the pop-punk genre , try new found glory , the ataris , or maybe older blink-182 material . this album is made for stupid punk with no attention span that are in the scene for the wrong reason . it kill me to see so many people enjoy this trash when there is so much good music out there . do not degrade yourself by buying and supporting this no talent band . pick up some afi or bad religion to truly understand the real meaning of being punk .
1	if you like blue and you like rock , this is your ticket . not only can joe play some awesome guitar , he is also got a great voice to go along with it . i just now discovered joe and am in love with his music ( my wife is too ) . great guitar , great singing , great beat , great band . what more can you ask for ? if his other work is a good a this , then i will end up owning every cd he ha . seriously , if you do not like this cd and you like the blues/rock genre then you need to go see a doctor .
0	buy this album only to complete your dylan collection . even if you like sinatra you will be disappointed in dylan interpretation . if this is what he continues to put out i would suggest retirement with dignity . if this is something he felt he had to do then he should not have charged for it . very dismal , not even good for elevator music .
0	poor sound track . these is a very loud drum in the background that distracts from the very good violin music . if the mixing wa better this would have been a fantastic track . unfortunately i did not hear the drum in the very short sample you hear when buying on amazon .
0	sample track sounded great , but when you listen to the entire cd it is one monotonous song after another . had high hope for this , but wa pretty much disappointed in the tune . probably will give it away if i can find someone who want it .
1	love it !
1	beautiful album
1	we lost this wonderful country singer way too young . his song calm the soul and lift your spirit . he will be missed .
0	it doe not work , i bought it 2 or 3 time this wa a digital purchase
0	it hurt to listen to the lp version . this should be erased from existence . the real song is not available in the itunes store usa only the uk itunes store .
1	i listen to the mp3s for enjoyment but also for training purpose on the guitar . so it go without saying that quality is paramount .
1	nate dogg took p-funk and funk to a whole new level with his smooth blue jazz vocal yes sir no musician man can sing like nate dogg or even come close or near or even simaler
0	horrible . i only bought it because the ex-girlfriend wanted it . i wish there wa a no star rating .
1	i stumbled upon lp searching for vinyl record on youtube and nearly fell over when i started listening . she is absolutely incredible and ha affected me more than any artist in year !
1	love it . play it over and over
0	i am posting review firstly to express my disappointment and dissatisfaction with an item i purchased about couple of year ago . delayed a my review may be it is sincere . i am a fan of ultimate spinach and i consider them one of the best band of the bosstown rock scene . i had been looking forward to receiving the cd but when it arrived i found out to my dismay that there is some kind of static at the begining of every track . i am afraid that this is totally irresponsible on the part of iris record . i suppose i should have asked them for a full refund but i somehow opted not to do it .
1	this old world of ours sure is changing fast , at least for me , with seemingly everything entertaining ( news program , comedy monologue , tv show ) around u hop , skip and jumping from scene-to-scene or subject-to-subject so fast that it is a miracle we all do not suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) . it seems like we just have to have something changing all the time in front of our eye . but is it really entertainment when we have to have our brain hopped-up on caffeine just to keep-up ? i do not think so ! jeanne robertson stress through her story of the little thing that happen around her that humor is a very valuable commodity that we need to to be on the look-out for and enjoy on a daily basis . storytelling is not something new , in fact it is the forerunner to book and everything else that we currently use to communicate . and while storytelling can be from one person to another , it is best shared with an audience so that more can enjoy the story , and the audience can share between each other the point expressed in the story . in southern style , you have a recording of jeanne speaking before an audience that is truly enjoying the story , and you can almost see them wink at each other when something she say hit home . to me , southern storyteller are the best because the art ha carried on longer , and it is still considered an art . having lived all over the united state , i know other region have great storyteller , but there is something about the south that ha made the region retain it storytelling supremacy . some may say it because for so long so many folk lacked an education , or a tv or radio , and it wa necessary to tell story to keep others entertained . whatever the case , it is a blessing that one can conveniently download a cd to listen to a wonderful and gifted storyteller like jeanne robertson . while all of ms. robertson cd are excellent , southern style , to me , is the cream of the crop , and through amazon you can now download it . i would strongly suggest you download all of it because the story are very good , and they have a tendency to interweave : from the tale of the two miss north carolina and her husband ( left-brain ) exploit , to her fashion story of wearing a pashmina ( fancy wrap ) in new york . in closing , let me say i wa blessed to have have been raised in the south , with it great storyteller , but for those of you who were not , i can think of no better example of storytelling by a master storyteller than southern style by jeanne robertson .
0	frank sinatra would not attempt to do rock , rod should not attempt to do old standard . strictly commercial , no heart .
1	el-p continues to impress . each of his album is very good , but they all build on the brilliance of the previous release . a true artist in every sense . really good album ! get it if you are remotely into rap/hip hop music in any way .
1	greate
1	love anything josh sings
1	great song is time of need when you need to lifted up . my soul do say yes to the creator of this universe . lord , i thank you and continue to bless brian wilson . this man can sing anything that is family oriented and church .
1	wa a gift for a friend a and he love it
0	this is the worst sleep music i have purchased from amazon . it is just the same 5 minute of music , cycled a dozen time . and the music is too intense for a sleep aid .
0	this digital copy seemed to be poor quality . i purchased it after listening to it a a billion time on on you tube and it just doe not sound the same . excellent song , but i will continue to use the the youtube version .
1	elizabeth powell vivid lyric float over melodic , garage rock with her hauntingly beautiful voice . the title track , some are lake , is the strongest with it narrative of lost young love . the band next album , cloak and cipher is even better .
1	have always loved this song- more the music than the word . it seems to be the only one by gotye that i like though .
1	very well put together list of classical music that relaxes you . i would definately recommend this to anyone ( even if they are not a big fan of classical music ) .
1	great for gym time
0	this soundtrack left off the only song i enjoyed from the movie . i guess i should have read the song list
1	now memory run with this a night at a local hotel packed with people and trying to get a drink of course i wa wearing the black dress .
0	awful . only disk 2 available .
1	awesomeness love this song very inspiring and heart felt , i could listen to it all day it make my heart so filled with the spirit .
1	the shock is still wearing off about dolores oriordans passing . my daughter wa devastated when i told her the news- she always wanted to see the band live . and this song- it wa both our favorite cranberry song . the song haunted my dream the night she passed . my daughter and i both love the way dolores sang . she wa obviously proud of her heritage and never tried to hide her accent in her song , and her voice played a big part in giving the band their signature sound . if you have never heard a cranberry record- this is probably the one to introduce yourself to their sound .
1	great song
1	this album is amazing . i have been a tough sell lately on new music - especially on first listen throughs . but i wa instantly hooked . if you like zaba , you will like this . it is different , but in a good way .
0	i purchased this by accident . i do not like her music which is too explicit . i can not say i hate it , because that would put me on the fence with love/hate .
1	it is a good song with nice lyric . the beat is slow jam style . may help ppl understand to listen to their mate before the relationship come to an end .
1	these song take me way back and i feel like i am right there with him when he sings . the song are uplifting .
0	i bought this album with an open mind . i truely enjoyed the duet with lee ann womack , mendocino county line . that wa the only good track . i thought that with the like of sheryl crow , bonnie raitt and rob thomas , this would be a comperable a the santana compilation . i wa sorely disappointed . the other celebrity artist sang back-up . you could barely even hear them . this wa a cheap attempt to draw in a more diverse audience by bringing in the big gun , but those big gun were nothing more than smoke and mirror . do not buy this album unless you want to flush your hard earned money down the drain .
0	maroon 5 ha joined the like of all the other modern day group . what wa once a very talented group now sound just like justin bieber and the like with the swilly high pitched run that all sound exactly alike . this may be fine for today youth who have no idea what constitutes a song with staying power or true musical value , but for u old classic rock people , i think adam levine should stay with his spot on the voice .
1	i am glad i purchased this selection due the fact that i have been searching for this song and the artist . amazon try to provide this and doe such a great job . thanks
1	have you ever felt like your day wa dragging ? those day when you are upset for no reason at all ? how about when you want to go to the gym and pump iron but you are just not feeling the appropriate motivation . i have found the absolute best thing you can do for any of the above affliction is listen to eye of the tiger . this song will cure any mental ailment . they you should have it pumping through the street of alaska during the dark part of the year to keep people from getting seasonal depression . i listen to this song and i am ready to take on the whole world ! to leap building in a single bound ! everyone need a daily doe of some eye of the tiger ! amazing !
1	emmylous voice is a good a it get here , and i wa amazed at the synergy between her and rodney . these duet could not be better . this album is stellar .
1	i like music and i find certain song that are inspiring and energizing . i have picked certain song from different album that i use to worship the lord and uplift me through the day
0	. which is not saying much since i got this a a freebie ! since this wa free , i decided to download it for kick . sanjaya started off with promise - but only got worse a the song progressed . while his diction wa good ( hence , the extra -star rating ) , it still did not make up for his breathy voice or his pitchiness ( going either sharp or flat - usually flat ) - and i still have no real idea what the song wa all about ! actually , i am rather glad i got this a a free download . at least i will know not to waste my money on the entire album !
0	should have been edited version it seemed what i wa purchasing great artist loved blurred line without the ugliness , make sure purchaser know what there buying , i gave it away
0	on the whole , the album is definitely not in the same league a a good pat boone album . however , i have found , when played at medium level , it doe provide measurable relief for hemmoroid suffering .
0	i attended a workshop given by mary desrosiers , back when she first released this album . i wa very disappointed to find that she had only a nodding acquaintance with the little house story , evidenced by comment she made throughout the workshop . sure , the incorrect reference were mostly detail oriented- but , if you are a diehard fan of laura ingalls wilder book , it is the detail that really count ! when it came to the music , i wa disappointed further to find that desrosiers used different song than the one laura had included in her book . for example , laura had included all of the lyric to roll the old chariot along in the long winter . instead of using the lyric provided , however , desrosiers decided to substitute a british sailor drinking song , claiming that lauras father wa really something of a lush . by the same token , her story behind billy boy is that lauras ma had sung the song to pa , when he came home from running around town , and she had not known where he wa . no incident like that is found anywhere in the entire little house series ! if you are just looking for some example of pioneer song , this album will fit the bill nicely . if you are truly wanting to know the music laura knew , a she knew it , keep looking .
1	this second single from the new album rise ( releasing june 25 ) is more of a power ballad . john cooper strained voice show more here than on most of their rock song , but it is still a good song with a great message , of letting love cut through the noise of our culture . if you are familiar with skillet , think along the line of lucy ( although american noise is not a story song ) . if you are not familiar with the band , just think of a regular power ballad from a good 80 rock band .
1	i love it !
1	this song is the reason that we , in the u , know who adele is . great lyric , great music , great adele .
0	the live version is not the version i wanted . do not care for all that talking during the song . i deleted it .
1	good song .
0	i did not want to use the credit card that got charged and it appears there is not process to change it after or during the purchase .
0	did not order , do not know why it is showing up on my account .
1	love , love , love this song !
1	great guitar and synth meld together pleasantly . vocal are smooth and hypnotic . overall a great album .
1	the best in country music .
0	with a very soothing voice i thought i would drift off immediately to sleep . you are asked to visualize a beautiful cozy cabin and a crackling fire in the fireplace . when her voice leaf you assumably asleep for 20 minute you are abandoned to the sound of a very silly sounding crackling fire that sound more like a recording of a recording of an artificial fire . the sound of the wind is also provided and ha a similar effect a the fire in the fireplace . fortunately it wa only a 99 cent wasted expenditure . there are some good sleep aid recording available but this is not one of them .
0	not close to his best , just pedestrian , a money making pot boiler .
0	i really expected to be blown away by this album . it wa one of the best selling record the year it came out , and this record cemented lil wayne a one of the biggest rapper on the planet . you could not turn the tv on without seeing him or this record . however , there were only 3 or so song that i liked . the other song just sounded the same and generically manufactured to me . this review is not a reflection on weezys rap style or lyric , but maybe the producing . clearly , the guy is talented , but the record just came across a bland and repetitive to me . his 2006 release with birdman wa slammin . i expected this record to sound a little closer to that . obviously , i am in the minority here , a the rest of the world can not get enough of this record .
1	this should be an international anthem for the million who resist the 9 to 5. or the answer to the life long question . where do i fit in ? leave it to los lobos to put this worrisome question to a foot tapping celebration ala zydeco blue . all i can say is bon temp roule !
1	this song is actually pretty clean and ha a great catchy rhythm . you may have heard it is cover in pitch perfect .
0	could not turn it off fast enough .
1	powerful . very upbeat song
0	i would not download this piece of dung if they were giving away free digital downloads of it ! always hated this song . the other day , it wa being played at work and i felt like jumping out the window or at least leaving the building for a breath of fresh air .
1	a fun song from it time
0	considering the review and the pedigree and the musicianship . just no soul , the singing . voice , doe not work ( for me ) i get - that they are good - just reminded me of the good stuff from the 70
0	well . the music itself is engaging . i had heard the song on a cruise ship and wanted the music to help learn the dance . sadly , the lyric are nasty , even in the radio version .
1	not really a fan of the artist but i do like this song . great to listen to when i am at the gym for motivation .
1	lin-manual miranda is an outstanding composer ! he is a remarkable man making history on the stage with history a his inspiration and a musical form that allows much information in the shortest time !
0	and i say that so loosely . this song wasnt great the first time i heard it and it is still sugar-coated fluff . i mean i can get into certain song that are all pop and little substance , but this one grate on my nerve . first . copying irreplaceables beat almost completely wa a terrible thing to do ! not original and we had enough of that song . that is what this song totally ride on ! at least chris brown , even though it is a similar beat , ha something going for his song , with you ( better lyric , nice video ) . altogether , i just do not appreciate either of them ripping the irreplaceable beat off though . come on ! we heard it enough in 2006/2007 ! second . i will never forget you/you are in everything i do/ ( later ) just like a tattoo/i will always have you blah , blah , blah , blah , jordin . start writing your own song and maybe you will get some attention ! 2.25 star . end note : beautiful voice but get a new producer who is not afraid to try something new and different ! i know it can be hard being original these day in the studio because it seems like everyone ha nearly tried everything but ( and that is a b i g but ) copying a song beat that ha previously been played into the ground is the opposite of what you want to do ! the lyric are trite and super-elementary and nothing ( i mean nothing ) besides the vocal work stand out !
0	i never purchased it , it piggy backed on another order and claim i wanted it . besides that it awful . whiny voice , cheesy boring and silly . sound like typical office people trying to get in touch with emotion and make amoving song lol .
1	mr. sandman is one of the few song i can sing with gusto . of course i cange the word him to her but it work .
0	nothing good worth mentioning but picture perfect ! .that tracc with brandy wa o.k an dumb s * t shouldve been without snoop an blacc ty .
0	i never ordered or received this . why is this listed under my purchase , is it just one song or the whole album ?
0	buyer beware ! i wa given this recording a a gift , no enhancement will help , it is awful . the diction is horrendous , the voice is deplorable . it is a pity that the aria and song are subjected to such a cruel torture . i never heard of this performer , i am just wondering if it wasnt a promotional item and that the seller wa duped , the person who gave me this gift , certainly wa .
1	great song i have always love that song
1	lorraine feather is the complete package . here are incredible intelligence and uniqueness , beautiful voice , wide-ranging mood and arrangement . always surprising and satisfying . you must hear lorraine feather to believe it can be this good .
1	we listen to many cd for 1-3 year old . this is the favorite she always request . in fact , this is our second copy . we try others and she dance and sings to them but request her old favorite when painting or dancing .
0	it is a good song but it is not a spectacular song . this song is lacking the spectacular quality of all of her previous music . i love gaga , but not this song
1	this is an absolutely wonderful cd for all ages- listening to it gave me a sense of being lighter a those stress , that you might not realize your carrying throughout the day , just fall away leaving you with a sense of peace and serenity .
0	utterly appalling recording .
1	love this cd . a great mix of fun and serious ballad .
0	not exactly what i wanted but it ok. wow they require twelve mote word before i can leave this review .
1	i am in love
1	i needed to refresh myself on the lyric . i sang this song at a best friend wedding in the 1970s . then at his son , and now for the daughter . crazy thing is , when i wa younger , john denver wa a good friend . i miss him still .
0	if you are looking for something to help you sleep , this is not it . the 30 second preview here sound peaceful ( and almost hypnotic to me ) but the full version ha some strange element . a the other reviewer said , it doe have a lot of static . it sound like . popping noise , or something to that effect . very strange .
0	his commentary around the song on this version of live at massey hall wa sarcastic and disrespectful to the man who lived on the ranch . i would seen a youtube clip of him at massey hall where he talked about buying the ranch and how an older man lived there and he would written the song for him . it wa kind , and touching , and the song itself wa great . look for another year at massey hall , i am !
1	great album ! they have such wonderful voice . i wish i could sing like that .
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	came in distorted could not even hear it
1	these two are amazing .
1	first cd i have bought in a long time . sturgill simpson should have won a grammy for this album in my opinion , and i am not even that much into country music . this guy is in a genre of his own , and it kick a $ . can not wait to see what he come up with on his next album .
0	this is not a piece of music . it is only used for tuning up an orchestra or instrument . unless you want to tune your musical instrument , do not download . all this is is a single tone , do not download .
1	personally , i liked the original version of the song from the movie , but i love this version best !
1	i have this song at the head of my classic rock playlist . mr. grey had a great voice , this song ha a happy/upbeat tempo and it serf a a kinda thank you for all the song that follow : give me the beat boy ! just writing this review i need to listen to this again .
1	a a wildland firefighter travailing the country , this song hit home for me and my boy . what a great sad story .
1	great song !
0	the sound quality of this cd is awful . can not imagine what it would be like if it had not been remasterd .
0	well , keysha cole is a well loved and respected artist , however , if you like her cd then you will love the real woman to woman which is a book dedicated to woman from all walk of life . this is not a book to shove religion down anyones throat , it is a book of encouragement and strategy for the everyday woman to conquer everyday problems/issues woman face . here is the link & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/woman-to-woman-spiritual-strategies-for-the-everyday-woman/dp/1484096304/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > woman to woman spiritual strategy for the everyday woman < /a >
1	you know , i am just not attuned enough to go through album by album listing the difference from original to remastered . but i will say , paying $ 60 ( or $ 70 or $ 80 ) for this seven-albulm set is tremendous . i am probably like a large contingent of springsteen fan ; i became aware during the born in the usa tour , then purchased all the previous cassette . so , in the last 28 year , cassette were lost and/or became obsolete . now i am able to purchase all seven for what amount to $ 8.50 each . that is a win right there . and like a number of people , i find the first seven springsteen to be the best , sans a couple of live album . so , win-squared . $ 60 to rediscover the bruce i first became acquainted with .
0	what is wrong with record company these day ? everytime you turn around there is yet another greatest hit , ultimate , essential , box set or whatever hit package that basically consist of all the same song , give or take one or two exception . this hit package is no different . amy fan , you already have all this - there is no need to buy it . what is up with amy anyway ? what audience is she trying to speak to ? her old christian audience , pop audience , adult comtemporaray audience , all of them ? she is all over the place . i think everyone is kinda over it . she ha a great career - nothing to be dissapointed with . it is just time to retire . for example - i dindt even know this wa released . never heard anything about it . it wa never promoted - probably because there is nothing to promote .
1	addictive
1	thank you belinda for recording this song ! it is fun upbeat and showcase belindas vocal talent . just downloaded yesterday and have listened to the song about 20 time . make you feel good and it is so wonderful to have belinda put out another great pop hit ! a+
1	beautiful lyric easy listening
0	i bought this thinking since it her first christmas cd . i wa very disappointed . her range of voice ha changed a lot . she sound nasally and scream a lot in some of the selection . terrible !
0	i only purchased this more for posterity than anything . it is a dreadful recording and the vocal on 2nd chapter are down right ear piercing , not in a good way . i remember being so much better , then again we all thought early christian rock/folk music wa delightful .
1	nice
1	i purchased the presale album . two song are available immediately . i think this may be their best album yet !
1	awesome
0	what i simply and always say , is that when a artist ha to come out with a song , they do not actually deliver when it ha came down to song choice . for fantasia to try to make that attempt with going to a modern r & b voice and sound in her music , it actually ha not actually drove the point home . her song without me , with kelly roland and missy elliot , the second single from her album side effect of you is honestly one of the worst choice she ha made into song . i really found it to be much weaker in the song from fantasia , while it is more of a song that would fit into kelly rowlands sound , or something that ciara would make . i definitely wa not that impressed with the song , and it definitely is fantasia low point . song : d+
1	bought this for secret but am getting hooked on the rest . still a timely cd . came on time and in a bubble envelope . worth a purchase for sure .
1	love it !
1	i thought it wa fabulous ! i am the same age a barbra and knew she wa going to be something special the first time i heard back when . this is her best yet .
1	awesome product i like it !
1	amazing
1	getting a new album from robin feel like a gift from god . every song on here is wonderful- one hauntingly beautiful song after another . i already had do not cry alone and bought a cd from germany to get mother of love , but had never before heard any of the others . what a treat for every robin gibb and bee gee fan- a new album with 17 gorgeous song ! i can not stop listening to this album , especially anniversary and sanctuary !
0	i never ordered this !
1	the best song were from the 80 and this is no exception . i heard this before the whole how i met your mother hype and it ha always been a fun song to jam along to , especially in the car .
1	i have chosen this song to be played at my funeral upon my passing . i love the old fashioned hymn and patriotic music .
0	this is only relevant for the vinyl version . this is about the piece of plastic itself , not the music . i am a very big panic ! fan . once i saw brendon tweeted about this , i preordered it . i received it on the day of the release , april 1 , all good . only today i got to listen to it . 1. it is all just a tiny-bit too high pitched . playing it in sync next to a digital version of the same song you can hear it , and even without . 2. first time i played it , and i swear i watched this thing like a hawk and cared for it like it wa my child , there is a lot of jumping in victorious and do not threaten me with a good time .
0	having worn out my vinyl copy of animalism , the animal third album , the first beeing the animal and the second animal track , i bought the cd on the repertoire label and it easily qualifies a the worst remastering job i have heard so far . the original punchy sound with excellent bass and good high definition is degraded to a muddy sound that sound like beeing re-recorded in a bathman plus that someone put some strange extra echo on the track . a complete failure ! repertoire should fire the engineer and give it another try- thank god i have the original on tape - in stereo !
1	excellent
1	great price ! product a stated ! no problem !
0	i would rate this cd a just ok. for the money there are better sounding version out there . this ha the uk mix which sound flat and lifeless . it ha 4 bonus track , ironically from the u lp , which are already on the album . a better choice for bonus track would have been some song that are not already on the album like - i will get you & baby it is you . i give it 2 star out of a possible 5 .
0	the cd control system get 5 star hand down . the problem is that there are only 16 track although the cd ha 17. track # 2 is missing when you download it .
1	fine product
0	you could not tell this wa a live recording and i wanted a studio version .
1	i love this song because it reminds me of the movie kill bill . i even use it a a ringtone for my phone .
0	it is a pretty song , with great vocal , but i am not sure about the lyrics/message . once i downloaded and listened to it in it is entirety i wa displeased- sound rather morbid to me . not a great choice for a christmas song . sure it ha a christmas-y sound , but if you really listen , it is not about anything to do with christmas . is it just me , or do the selection this year seem kind of lousy thus far ? i really enjoyed this 25 day of free downloads advent-type calendar last year . i looked forward to getting up every day to download the latest . it made for a great collection of christmas song , arrangement i wa not familiar with . this year is disappointing by comparison .
0	this album wouldve been so much better with live instrumentation . i hope his next one will be 100 % great like he is on the road with his band .
1	who rock harder than nickelback ? i downloaded this song because i listen to it weekly when wwe come on . so now i use it a a ringtone for my android phone .
1	such a beautiful track . i come back and listen to this at least once a month .
1	i fell in love with ann wilson the first time i heard dreamboat annie . 36 year later , ann wilson sound even better . wether you are a heart fan , or have never heard the group before , this is a must-have album if you love hard-driving rock and roll .
0	shania is my favorite female artist of all time , and one of my favorite artist a well . so , i wa so excited to hear that she had finally released a new song . but , i wa horribly disappointed when i heard this song . i really expected better from her than this ! in the past , i would have bought a shania cd without bothering to preview it first because i knew that it would be really good , if not excellent . when shania finally release her next cd , i will definitely preview it first , and if it is a bad a today is your day , i may not even bother buying it .
0	it is either badly done or just a really bad idea . elvis voice sound rough . i do not recall thinking that when i heard his original recording . it make his pairing with the orchestra a bad match . it take away from his greatness rather than enhancing it . i will not be buying any more of the song from this album . i have been an elvis fan since the first time i heard do not be cruel and hound dog played on my radio over 50 year ago . re-release more mix of his original if you must , priscilla , but please do not do anything like this if i can dream album again and no duet either . it is just disrespectful of his memory .
0	ruined a perfectly good song
0	why do you make me so happy and also want to to die on the same album ?
0	not the version i knew or wanted . did not know that before purchase ! wa not given possibility to see that it wa a different version . did not say remix when purchased .
0	the song is not being sung . it is an orchestra playing the instrumental . given it is not what i expected i rated it 2 star . but if you are into orchestra and instrumentals you may love it . could play it at bed time .
0	poor quality mixing . poor quality sound . save your $ ! look elsewhere .
1	i bought this a i had never heard of it and being an avid theatre buff thought it would be worth a listen . i wa pleasantly surprised . from the first listen i felt i could follow the story before reading the synopsis and i wa humming some of the tune . i could not wait to play it again .
0	i do not normally give a poor review . i am more likely to lean toward average or better . the product is fine . play well , no issue at all . the problem i have is that i did not get it for over 24 hour . i think today you should be able to purchase a song on-line and be able to play it then and there . i ended up buying this elsewhere because i got tired of waiting . i will not buy music from amazon anymore . but i will still buy everything else !
1	i purchased this cd for my wife during christmas . she love jackie evancho and since she ha been playing it , i have also become a fan . miss evancho pose an incredible voice .
0	not my stile
1	the cd arrived on time and in good condition . the music is loud clear and good recording quality ! i will be ordering more dick jonas music !
1	i bought four of these . two for myself , just in case they go out of print and one deteriorates . i have a vast sinatra collection . this is one of the top 5 disc . the others being only the lonely , swinging lover , september of my year and the live at the sand .being one of the top five of any major artist say a lot . being in the top five of the greatest singer ever is an eloquent statement indeed . it is the definitive interpretation of the jobim sound and the most candle-light dinner elegantly romantic album you will find . having all these song in one collection is long long overdue .
1	love it !
1	1. waltz for j.d . 9:57 . 2. pretty bossa 8:40 . 3 . 6/8 thing 9:07 . 4. blue and green 8:36 . 5. this is new 6:06 . 6. fit for a prince 7:00 . 7. alphabet city 7:56 . 8. the loop 5:48 . 9. she is leaving home 10:02. john bishop , drum . jon davis , piano . paul gabrielson , bass . steve hill , drum . produced by paul gabrielson .
0	every song sound the same .
1	i love her music . it contemporary gospel and this song just touched my heart the first time i heard it on the radio . worth the purchase .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is catchy , both lyrically and musically . i consider it to be one of my most favorite song , but i am biased that way .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
0	lousy choice of song
0	not a expected . thought the music would be calming , but it ha so many short piece it wa not enjoyable for me .
0	doll revolution ha one major flaw . only a few of the song showcase susanna hoffs on lead vocal . ( i love to hear her sing . ) if you purchase this album and enjoy hoffs voice , you will be left wanting more . while i applaud the idea of trying something new , it did not work here . the bangle need hoffs on lead vocal . it is just that simple .
1	i love this tune , it my fav dance tune off all time , this tune should always be remebered and should be loved forever
0	i found it poorly performed and since the nutcracker is one of my favorite , i wa disappointed . do not download .
0	only liked one song . let your hair down david make something fun and not boring . we hear the same old traditionals every year .
1	all time great song by a great country singer . great to play at 50th wedding anniversary .
0	just junk
1	great soulful delivery on every song included in this project .
1	when you can listen to the whole album nonstop over and over , then you know you have got a good album . eisleys unique sound is so soothing , refreshing , and at the same time slightly rockin . i would say it sound like poppyish rock with a rhodes keyboard , with girl vocal and beautiful harmony that will definately send a chill down your spine . like stacys ahhs on marvelous thing and on plenty of paper . and in brightly wound where stacy and sherri sing two completly different verse and melody at the same time and in perfect harmony . every song ha it moment of pure joy and satisfaction . it just make you feel good . simply put , it just good listening . good music for the ear .
1	this is my favorite version of nessun dorma bar none and i include in this , pavrotti , domingo , etc . although they are supposedly more tecnically correct , i am so taken by the emotion in boccellis voice that there is no comparison for me .
1	i miss those goodnight kiss
1	i have listened to this album probably 5 time since this morning . i have been a long time volbeat fan . these guy bring it all to the table with this album . trust me . get it ! now !
0	some of these song are so bad they are funny . i kept bandy bandy , by zap mama featuring erykah badu , which is nice . also kept two other track , which i shall not name , but only for my really bad song playlist .
0	mediocre compared to other tribute . just did not enjoy these rendition the same way i have other vsq performance
0	still a glorious voice . but the arrangement suck . too lounge-y . only a piano when some of these require lush arrangement .
1	great song !
1	saw the video for this song back when mtv wa mtv . loved the funky vibe , make you want to put on a hat and dance on a theater stage ( it doe for me ! ) . : - )
0	original pressing of capitol the george , john , paul & ringo songbook ( 1971 , st-839 ) are on their tuscan red label . when stu phillips is not throwing dissonance and confusing counter-melodies into the 10 track that comprise this set , he slows their tempo down to a dirge pace . the very last selection , bangladesh wa so unrecognizable i had to consult the playlist to find out what i wa listening to . or maybe that repetitive tabla shouldve tipped me off ? admiral halsey sound like a lullabye . it do not come easy is listless despite a fuzz guitar lick near the close . in stus hand , paul mccartney often disparaged long & winding road is more saccharine than a 200 packet box of sweet n low . hey jude and let it be are not much better . john lennon wa spared the phillips touch , probably because there wa no way to de-gonad the track from his & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/plastic-ono-band/dp/b000mvfgd8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > plastic ono band < /a > & nbsp ; lp . remember : the sound you make is muzak to my ear from how do you sleep on the & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/imagine/dp/b000mhv2v2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > imagine < /a > & nbsp ; album ? perhaps john wasnt addressing his former partner but the presumptive stu phillips . this collection of hypnotic elevator music is strictly for beatles completists and nurse ratched ( of & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/one-flew-over-the-cuckoo-s-nest/dp/0790732181/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > one flew over the cuckoo nest < /a > & nbsp ; fame ) . program- side one [ 2:48 ] here come the sun [ 4:30 ] hey jude [ 3:07 ] another day [ 2:20 ] let it be [ 3:18 ] the long and winding road side two [ 3:29 ] my sweet lord [ 4:59 ] uncle albert/admiral halsey [ 2:45 ] something [ 2:58 ] it do not come easy [ 4:01 ] bangla-desh total time : 34:15
1	awesome song
0	this is one of the worse gospel compilation i have heard . this ha nothing to do with gospel . it is a mix-match of melody , poorly played .
1	a a worship leader i look forward to every new release from chris tomlin . each new project will contain song that , in time , become the cornerstone of our worship set . i have listened to burning light almost non-stop for the past several week and i believe this is one of tomlins strongest effort to date . listen to this project for a couple of day and you will not be able get the tune to whom shall i fear ? out of your head . we incorporated his rendition of crown him with many crown ( majesty ) on easter sunday morning and it wa very moving . keep em coming chris .
1	the presentation of this well-know musical piece is superbly performed by the london philharmonic orchestra . if you have not listened to it in a while , i strongly suggest that you revisit it . you will not be disappointed .
1	i love this song and on top of it all it wa super easy to download and to listen on any device .
1	older style music , which i like better .
1	i love this song and this artist his voice is amazing and i always enjoy anything by him . if your wanting some praise and worship in your life this is the song for you !
1	awesome !
1	sweet song
0	not the same kimbra !
1	this is some good music , right here ! larue is a vocal beast . i had the pleasure of being at the live recording and i wa blown away with her vocal , the background vocal and the band . everything wa on point . the music a easy to follow and i did not feel cheated when it came to ministry . although it wa the recording for her cd , she still stayed with the ministry element and tear were flowing , hand were praised , and praise were being given to the father . in listening to the cd , it take me right back to the point in time when our hand were raised , eye closed , dancing , clapping and just praising . i love to worship and i do not want to leave this place will have you with the ugly cry ( smile ) . do not sleep on this one . and , when she minister , you can see that she ha a heart for god and god people . support her ministry . it is well worth every dime .
0	i enjoy music that clearly tell a story ; the tone is moving and very enjoyable . what i liked the best is that you can actually understand the word that are sung . hopefully artist in the future could follow example ; where music could be music again .
1	relaxing
1	i absolutely love this song . back in the day when i wa a little girl , i would hear my grandparent playing the song because it would come on the radio which now make me feel old but i am only 38. i love older song and this is one of many that emmylou harris wrote that is still popular to this day .
0	not a fan . skip this song each time .
1	just what i needed to get into the spirit of the holiday . absolutely love it . so nice and mellow . highly recommended .
1	this is the rest song in the world
1	great song and i am an 80 metalhead . that is saying something .
1	easy and fast download
0	the song are great , but the audio quality is so bad that i want my money back . it it a static-filled , compressed mess and it is pretty hard to listen to . whomever mixed this should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a potentially good album . waiting for the remaster .
1	i have been a fan for many year . this is a great collection . there is only one track i do not care for and i will skip over .
0	some is a bit catchy , but mostly i laugh questioning why i continue listening instead of skipping to the next song on random shuffle . sound like someone who ha spent a bit too much time in club and ha made some friend with good enough equipment to make a cd with her . lyric provided by many a drug induced night that catalyzes the creative and philosophical side to come out . high quality for an amateur project but difficult to listen to .
1	maybe this album is not a good a rejoyce , but it is still great , i just love her !
0	first of all , let me start out by saying that while i have been a huge fan of the band since the earliest day , i am not one of those classic chicago fan who hate the 80 stuff . in fact , chicago 16 is one of my favorite album by the band . and 17 is an album that they have every right to be very proud of . and while 18 and 19 were just cranking-out-the-formula album for them at that point , they at least had some huge hit single , which wa really all the band wa about at that point . by the time they got to 21 in 1991 , both the format and the band ability to contribute to it had past it time and that wa ( should have ) been it for the that period of the band . they then spent the next 15 year releasing various compilation , live and christmas albums- some of which were considered part of the canon and some not- so that we could get to the point in 2006 where their next album of new material could conveniently be called xxx . i , like a lot of fan , were very curious to see what this new album would bring . a return to the use of roman numeral indicated a possible to return to the classic sound . a - even if completely coincidental - use of triple x hinted a something edgy . instead , they inexplicably tried to revive the 80 sound of the band . i say inexplicable because not only doe a large portion of their most loyal fan base dislike this period of the band , but even if they could have come up with another 17 , the band and the format were both long past the point of being able to create any hit single with it in 2006. there could have been another hard to say i am sorry on this record but radio would not have played it anyway . so why even attempt to go down that path ? who were they trying to reach with this album ? and , worst of all , the attempt failed . there is not much at all to recommend on this album for much of anyone . the song are weak and the arrangement and production is tired . one can only wonder why they thought this album would be a worthwhile effort in the first place . it doe serve to make weak album like 13 , xiv and 21 seem not so bad in retrospect , though . what chicago need to do- what almost all of their fan would like to see- is a return to experimental and jazz-rooted sound of the earliest stuff . sure , lamm and pankow both ran out of good song idea back in the 70 , but certainly they must still have the chop and experience to arrange even poorly-written tune in an interesting manner . ( and let u be honest . even a lot of the material on their early record were not great song . but the arrangement were almost always aggressive and interesting . ) itd be nice to see them at least attempt a real comeback album . or maybe they do not want to . which is fine , but then it is probably best to just limit future release to compilation and live album .
1	i love this song ! i can not get it out of my head ! guaranteed you will hear this all summer long !
0	there is only one song on this cd worth listening to . i recoment getting the mp3 version of tarzan boy and ignore the rest of the song .
0	so i know there are two dirty word in the song and i wanted the clean version ( that you hear on the radio ) so i could listen to it even if my child pop into the room . but instead of using another word like the radio edit . this one us cartoon effect . very weird and just a you are getting into the song that pop up . wish i wouldnt have bought this one .
1	this is one of the better collection out there . some very hard to find song on this wonderful 3 cd set . come in a very nice hard plastic box 3 cd holder which is rare these day . most multi-cd set case are flimsy and fall apart quickly . not this one . this is a bargain . it seems that the previous review wa for the wrong cd .
0	everything about this album is just bad . from the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting . it is terrible . ok , let u start it with the obvious . how do they forget the ya-yas version of midnight rambler again ! ? hell , even the album version would be acceptable . that song is undeniably a stone classic , in every single sense of the word . it wa bad enough to miss it on 40 lick , but it omission here is indefensible . that alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it . you could make a full cd of song that do not deserve to be here . more than half the third disc is garbage from their worst year of songwriting . then some classic that do not really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gem . are not fade away , have you seen your mother , fool to cry , respectable , and the last time really better song than can not you hear me knocking , moonlight mile , let it bleed , and all down the line ? and come on . street of love , harlem shuffle , highwire , love is strong , anybody seen my baby , do not stop ? over album cut like sway , bitch , and monkey man ? i get you want to have a collection that span their entire career , but they should really focus on the golden year , rather than equal time allowed for these awful 90 cut . hell , i mean even we love you , little red rooster , and heart of stone are bad choice . look , i know i have a bias . i love these boy . disregarding whatever category the beatles might fall into , they are inarguably the single greatest rock ` n roll band of all time . but even a a major major fan , i would not recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the stone . i cut my teeth on this band with 40 lick . it wa a good intro to the band . or should i say disc one wa a good intro to the band . it is basically the same story here , although they were smart enough to add she wa hot ( even though the shine a light version is much better ) and the killer , kick-ass , powerhouse rock off . other than that , there is no difference between them . 5 star for the music , obviously . i mean some of these song still bring a tear to my eye when i listen to ` em . insanely , absurdly , unbelievably great stuff . but do not get this album . it is not worth the price . find a friend who love the stone ( if you are smart , you will have a few ) and ask them to make you a mix . or get 40 lick , used , for a couple buck . just stay away from this nonsense . no midnight rambler ! ? the title grrr ! ! ? . a gorilla ! ? i give up . i am going to my room and putting on sticky finger .

1	incredibly lyrical and musically talented . a breath of fresh air !
1	awsome song
0	great cd , but the person i sent it to is in prison and there wasnt a purchase invoice with it so the person wasnt allowed to receive it . very disappointing .
1	love it , so upbeat , so hot !
0	destined to appear on worst ever list for decade . knock william shatner out of first place for most embarrassing vocal performance ever . dylan wa always a horrid singer , but we forgave him because he wa a brilliant poet . here he mutilates the exhausted warhorse we have all come to despise . you simply can not believe your ear .
1	wishbone ash ha always been a favorite of mine and these recording are exceptional in quality
1	i love hawaiian music . i used to own two hawaiian cd but never really liked them . this cd is incredible and i will always listen to the song when i am on the beach .
0	this artist leaf a lot to be desired . i actually tried to listen to a little bit of this and and keep an open mind . but i found myself not being able to get past the first thirty second . it is the same regurgitated drivel that is all too commonly pass for music today . save your money or get it on bootleg . personally i would not take this for free . add to the fact that this artist seems to enjoy the company of thief , cop killer , drug addict and ex con . not the kind of person for me . natali , if you are reading this , i hope you make some better choice in the future .
1	i love don meons music , but there are a few song that will not play . my favorite are i will say yes and the greatness of you
1	another song i have not heard in a long time and now i can listen whenever i want .
0	this is not the original studio version of the song from the lp , it is the live version from the chuck berry film , hail ! hail ! rock n roll . it is misleading to label it re-mastered when it is a different version from the original .
0	i know lot of folk love this album . i have been a huge boc fan since they started in 72. i can not listen to this album . except for the remake of astronomy , the song are awful . boc always have great song , very melodic , a pleasure to listen to . this is not true on this album . one bad album out of all their album is not a tragedy . they continue to put out good album to this day . i will be seeing them yet again in san francisco on july 20. i guarantee they will not be playing any song from this dog . it is all taste anyway . to those who love it , enjoy it for me , because i can not .
1	this product is simply a recorded countdown for each 20 second interval of exercise and 10 second of rest for a total of 8 cycle .
0	and this year crud-fest winner , the person who received the most vote from every brain-dead glossy eyed plankton watching . who even care anymore ? yet another drone pulled off the production line , this gimp being another in the long run of inoffensive handsome white boy , aimed primarily at stupid people and , judging by the popularity of this single , there are an awful , awful lot of . so let u talk about the single . with the exception of the excrement that wa last year winner ( steve brookstein , currently missing in action - yet another one-hit wonder who well never see again ) first ( and only ) solo attempt - the dire phil collins cover , this is easily the worst actual attempt at a song yet . originally planned for westlife , that is my goal wa panned and rejected by them ( them ! westlife ! ) for being too weak , but it sure wasnt weak enough for shayne ward , currently number one for the fourth week running a i type this . but what doe that mean , exactly ? i will tell you - nothing . the general public are such idiot , such pathetic , tell u what to buy and we will easily led cretin , that they would buy anything after seeing it on a reality program . shayne ward could have released a record of him whistling the marmite theme and it would have gone straight to number one . and it is going to continue , is not it ? this wa a massive hit , the show wa a massive hit , so we are going to continue to be bombarded with bland , generic singer and pointless song like this . if you bought this junk , or if you watched this junk , the curmudgeon hold you personally responsible . you should be ashamed of yourself for bringing yourself down to the gutter mass , watching this easily-digestible pond-life program , and buying it cynical , disgusting product . one day , i hope to live in a world where television is not swamped by reality television , where tv schedule and budget are not ruled by program aimed at the great unwashed , where the chart are not in the vice-like grasp of dire tv talent show winner ( and loser ) . that , lady and gentleman , that , is my goal . the_curmudgeon_hates_you @ yahoo.co.uk
1	leann rime is one of my favorite artist to begin with . no dislike , loved everything about this song . recommended to anyone who need rapture .
0	this is a poor recording of a great performance . i thought my stereo amplifier wa damaged when i heard the periodic crackling noise while playing the peer gynt suite 1 and 2. but no , i can hear the occasional hiss and pop noise ( but not a pronounced ) when playing the same track on my laptop pc using my bose headphone . this cd might be passable if you just listen to music on an ipod or phone . however , if you enjoy listening to great music on your hi-fi stereo , do not waste your money on this rubbish . i wish i could get my money back .
1	i just love it . the music is will done .
1	good song
0	no thunder . at all !
0	well if this is the best massive attack album , then i will not be buying any more . nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop imo . this is way overrated ! i somehow missed out on massive attack back in the day , yet i listened to and loved portishead , hooverphonic , morcheeba , sneaker pimp becoming x , etc . there are a few good track , but for the most part , it is a mish-mash . maybe if these song actually went somewhere and they were about half a long in length . repetitive running loop while a guy mumble self aware hipster-speak get dull fast . ya know , getting a few decent female soul singer and a sequencer doe not make a good record .
1	exceptional drop of passion resonate with clarity , depth , and emotive crescendo throughout the masterpiece love song aint no mountain high enough ; sung with assured perfection by diana ross ; brilliantly written by nickolas ashford & valerie simpson . we soar through the cloud with this flawless rendition . we are lost in it lyrical poetry . we are captured by ross genteel and unique voicing , inflection , and intonation ; she set the stage for listener - in her directness & sincerity . like a soothing wind - le mesure de lamour - her voice capture u anew each time we listen to it . superior backup vocal and orchestration elevate it to it rightful status a a classic . whether we are asleep with this beautiful song secreting itself into our memory or relaxing in our romantic , nocturnal state - we can easily become enamoured in the meaning , enrichment , and theme so present in this joyous , uplifting recording . just send for me , oh baby . remember the day i set you free i told you you could always count on me from that day on , i made a vow , i will be there when you want me , some way , some how . cause baby there aint no mountain high enough , aint no valley low enough , aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe . my love is alive way down in my heart although we are mile apart if you ever need a helping hand , i will be there on the double a fast a i can . do not you know that there aint no mountain high enough , aint no valley low enough , aint no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe .
1	nice change for adam .
1	amazing voice
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
0	another balcony sacrifice . they should be ashamed of themselves
0	i went on ringtones for android , listened to i walk the line and bought it . problem is it wasnt a ringtone , but the whole song .
0	i do not have this song on my music and i did not order this song must take charge off. ? and hate to write such lengthy review
1	i love this song and it wasnt available on itunes ! amazon had it and for cheap
0	saw them perform on a talk show and thought i might like them . oh well .
1	this is a song that will probably be one that is an all time hit . i love everything about it .
0	this is him singing a a younger artist . still have not been able to find the version where he is older and obviously much more emotional about this song . still an awesome and tear jerking song though .
0	a heaping pile of dung . i believe in his quest to become more like his alternative comedy , he ha evolved into the alternative to comedy . tradgedy .
1	nice album , easy to listen to , and obviously a hit for ms. morissette . would not doubt that because of the sound , lyric and time this album wa released , itll easily be noted a a
0	do not waste your time
0	ken vasoli graduated from my high school so all of you teeny bopping 12 year old who run around screaming , kenny , are full of it . this album is anything but what i expected from the band . if you want a real starting line sound drop by my house sometime and i will show you some tape i have of them playing local show around here . you know , before they sucked . ok , so they do not suck , but they were far better before they released this cd . stay underground with song like gregs last day and the original leaving . good starting line , unlike this album
0	this version is the live of dream on and not the studio version . still a great song but it would have been nice if it said it wa the live version .
1	i found this worship cd in a store randomly . it ha some of the best praise and worship song ever . i can not help but get up and praise my god when i hear these song . what a blessing !
1	awesome sound .
1	the song is great . i have been listening to it for year . it is just what i expected . that is the reason i bought it . i have been buying song from amazon since they started selling them . i am going to copy this and paste it to every song that i review . i hope you do the same .
0	this is not my type of music .
1	you are the one is an award winning song and just to get that song is worth the price of the album .
0	not one memorable song.disappointing
0	can not stand the voice , or the inst1rumentals in the back . i mean , whats the refund policy ? gad !
1	a great album . i am now a great new fan .
0	most song on this album are too similar . i only enjoyed 2 song . not the best album i have bought in a while . i do like sinach , and wa quite disappointed with this one .
0	i would rather donate my money to a corrupt charity [ . ] . reason why 50 cent is the best ! 1. i can relate to his lyric in da club and pimp 2. he on the radio and mtv all day ! ( which mean he talented ) 3. he ha talent ! because he doesnt play any instrument .
1	i had typed a review for another song jump , shout , boogie medley . and that review wa for both that song and this song , since i purchased both song at the same time for the same reason .
1	what can i say ? the world is just not ready for this musical genius who go hard at making his music solid , original and unique . i have been a fan since day one when i heard addiction on the radio following diamond girl . then , i wa too outdone when i learned he produced cassie me & you , cherri denniss hit i love you . finally , he put out his first self-titled album ryan leslie that shouldve went platinum . there were some major hit on that album that i am very upset a a fan did not get the recognition it desereved . but , the world just wasnt ready ! now , my fav underated artist/producer is back with his second album transition and i must say it is a transition from his first one . on this album ryan is more laid back and taking thing slow . i am in love with the infectious sunday night . i am also glad he put awesome resuce you ( which is only on the bonus cd ) . your not my girl is a funky moderate track that take you back to the olskool.zodiac is another groovy track . overall , this album it totally different than the first one . but , a a loyal fan i am gon na say get the album anyway and support this talented man ! next selection !
1	my dad really love these guy and he wa going crazy over this song so i decided to get it for him .
1	easy to learn and good song for a praise team , and a child choir get you blessing ! it great !
0	this probably is not the recording of this much praised song that you want - go to the album i want to see the bright light tonight and try the song there first . i think i mis-bought this version first and could not understand why it wa so often mentioned a among richard and lindas best . just saying .
0	if you are a tango dancer or d.j. , looking for a collection of the most danced-to tango in either the u.s. or argentina , you will be sorely disappointed with this collection . it contains few , if any , of the the essential golden era hit . instead it is comprised of mostly relatively obscure , non-danced-to , listening-only tango : early gardel , piazzola , etc . that you would almost never want to play at a milonga . calling the collection 50 essential tango is misleading at best . avoid it .
0	i have never laughed so hard at a classical music piece and the false ending just make it even funnier . maybe i should give it more star because it really brightened my day . plus it made me feel better about my own piano playing .
0	not the same singer that did the original hit like secret lover and always .
0	the tape will not play . it drag . ive tried other tape in the same player and have no problem .
1	traditional country !
1	she is always a 5 star to me .
1	i really love this song and enjoy having it on my computer and kindle . i like the idea of choosing the song i want and not having to purchase the entire album .
0	i wish she would have covered lesser known song by obscure [ to the mass ] songwriter . turn me on to something new v having me compare her version to the well known one . and come on , taking on the bos version of tougher than the rest ? who advised you ?
0	after listening to the preview on amazon i decided to buy the actual cd . i have always liked dj shadow , and wa interested to hear what kind of beat he wa making now ( in 2016 ) . it is typical shadow ambiance and found sound , but some track have wildly swung broken beat pattern like flying lotus and the like . a few track attempt a dubstep feel , but it come across a plodding . a couple selection even have some trap high hat pattern and tripleted pattern . those actually sound the coolest . the part that make me absolutely dislike the album ( even though part are ok ) is the rapper in the rap track that state that trump ha sex with his youngest daughter . so eff that rapper . i would suggest keeping your politics to yourself unless you wan na lose half of your audience . moby just did the same , i am selling all his cd now a he mouthed off too about trump .
0	far too cloying . the original fleetwood mac version wa sweet without being cloying and is far , far superior . unfortunately , that version is not available a a legal mp3 download . i am left with the option of buying the cd of bare tree for this song .
0	jimmy buffett and ian anderson of jethro tull both knew their limitation and talent . so when they put out christmas album , they knew what would work , and what would not , and made their musical selection accordingly . you will notice that buffett never once touch the religious piece and tull touch religious piece only a instrumental arrangement . but then again dylan ha always taken himself too seriously . some producer should have had the gut to tell dylan that his selection were atrocious , and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice . but big name produce big fear , and so , we have this piece of musical garbage . a many have noted the only piece that work at all is must be santa . and that is only because of what he doe with the reindeer name . everything else is like nail on a chalkboard . doe not dylan have enough money a it is ? but there could be a bright side . the military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high-level interrogation . but it could be against the geneva convention .
0	quality is ify .
1	it is weird and kinda creepy , but i love it .
1	i found this binaural suggestion online and have been able to get to sleep much more easilywith this in the background .
0	i love terrance and his acting is superb . he just can not sing but he can really play the guitar . i paid 13.00 for the cd and there were only 2 song i played a little . i enjoyed the spanish type song . maybe if he wa able to sing more soulful . anyway do not pay the cd , but i love you terrance you are one of my fav actor .
0	for one , it wa the short verision or radio version . also , they gave the impression that it wa un-edited but it wa , not that the content wa all that adult or vulgar . i wa very disappointed if they are going to put a warning label for content they should also put a warning label for edited content .
0	hurt my head . i am too old for this at 50 ! for sure .
1	i perfect feel good summer jam !
1	brings me back .
0	this wa purchased for someone else . i do not like it because i think it is an annoying song . not my type of music .
1	could not believe there were no 5 star review . this is my favorite relaxation cd and i have many . love the music that is played along with the sound of thunder . had this many year ago on cassette tape and although the cassette still play , it wa so nice to find on cd . also bought a copy for my daughter , who also love it
1	good cd
1	this is awesome ! i pop this cd in around thanksgiving and it basically play until january ! josh did an outstanding job . i love his version of the classic christmas song , especially little drummer boy . every track is great , in my opinion , however i am not to keen on the first noel . mainly because i am not a fan of faith hill voice and i am not convinced that their voice harmonize well together . again , that is just my opinion . i would recommend this cd to anyone and everyone . i love it so much and i hope many others will also !
0	i am disappointed in this version of the song . i can not understand the word at all . the singer are not louder than the accompaniment , so what is the point of a song if you can not hear or understand the word , especially in a christmas carol . there is a bell that is lightly dinged in the background and that is pretty .
1	for most of u who are familiar with bob baldwin body of work , the latest release - all in a day work , is simply brilliant . the opening song - a new york minute is mesmerizing and the title track is classic baldwin . if you have bobbaldwin.com , try playing funkin for jamaica and then can you feel it , from the latest release . both are vocalized by tonni smith . for anyone in doubt , please - you are invited to go back and give brazil chill another listen . you will be glad you did , that is all i have to say . brazil chill is just a brilliant a the others . i am building up my collection of baldwin cd until have a many a i can get . if you have never seen bob baldwin perform - this is the icing on the cake . i can attest to that ! he is a true professional , a skilled artist and band leader and fantastic performer !
1	when two super talent like keith urban and miranda lambert get together , it is bound to be a hit and this one certainly is ! i would rate this among the great duet in country music . highly recommended !
0	i love fall out boy but they ruinned this song . one of mjs best song he did : (
1	love this song !
1	tyte trakk
0	i am not sure who came up with the ridiculous track listing for this set . but ddamn , ss13 ? really ? pretty sad omission here . new slayer fan : start with reign in blood and buy the entire catalog . this is a waste .
0	something is up with the sound quality of this . i purchased it through amazon and received a digital download . the sound quality is weak , i do not know if i should try this again ? are the cd similar in sound quality ? it is a if too many db are being pushed through the system and you can tell a weakness in sound even at a low volume . it is weird !
0	not worth the money
1	love this song
1	lovely cd , calming and relaxing music .
1	uplifting song .
1	beautiful
1	i do notknow why , but i love this song .
0	i need to quantify my review up front . in my dictionary , you look up the word music , class brass , professional , and you will see chicago . anyone who know me , know that chicago is , and ha been , my favourite group since dirt , hand down . the only other band closer is the beatles . i own every 331/3 album , and every cd , twice . my key chain say chicago . my refrigerator and front door ha chicago magnet inside and out . anything with the chicago logo on it get saved . need more proof of my loyalty ? this cd saddens this loyal fan to the point of heartache . i did not say anything when this group started re-issuing album and continuing to count them a progressive roman numeral issue , i figured they earned the right , plus they had to eat . despite the sad death of guitarist terry kath , the loss of drummer danny seraphine and bassist-singer peter cetera , this group really worked hard , both in the studio and at the concert venue to remain a vibrant part of the music scene . it is not easy to stay current for 40 year and please everyone . when the new guy came on the scene , you did not hear me speak ill of jason scheff for sounding like cetera . cetera wa gone , jeff wa in and that is that . i did not ever expect any one of chicago subsequent guitarist to sound like terry kath , and frankly , i did not want them to . even the drummer , tris imboden , wa musically right for the fit of this band , all of them bringing their own piece of continuing chicago talent into the fold . but folk , this is not right . chicago ha more talent than this . part of me want very hard to salute them for being there for 40 year , the other part say that i will not pay high ticket price to stand in a cold seattle rain to hear them play this music in concert . i can hear the same stuff on night and day , chicago 21 and all the christmas song that i have already bought year ago . i do not know , maybe i am just getting to old , but i think my sixteen year old is going to akin xxx to elevator music a well . if you have to have it , then buy it . if you are hard up for money , save it for food or something worthwhile . i know my mom said that if i did not have anything nice to say then i should not say anything , but i am not getting a warm fuzzy feeling hearing this one . usually i am stoked and can not wait to tell a friend . i may have to pull the shade and bolt the door and turn off the telephone . thank goodness i have 29 other chicago album to listen to . better luck next time fella . maybe there wa just too many cook in the kitchen ?

1	the unique voice of bonnie tyler combined with the emotional presentation of the song lyric combine to make this a timeless and classic favorite .
1	love it !
0	not really chistmas-y , just 12 1/2 minute of repetitive and tedious listening . thankfully , it wa free , otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
