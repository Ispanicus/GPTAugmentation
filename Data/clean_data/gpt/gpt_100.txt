1	this is such a beautiful collection of song , and so well-composed . my youngest son and i both adore this album . this is a must-have for any music fan !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i have heard about this album but i am so new to the whole online review thing that i did not really know what to expect . i wa blown away by the album . the quality of the song and mix is great and even though it is a bit dated now , i still feel it good . i wa pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and they are very easy to listen to . not to mention the fact that the song are all mixed so well together . i have to believe that if you play this album loud enough you will get the best out of it . i have a few friend that are avid fan and they all gave me their opinion and when i told them that i had heard this album and they could listen to it , they each said it sounded great and that it would be an easy listening for them at work . all in all i would have to say that this is a great album and i will definitely re-listen to it again . i have had it for about 30 day and have been listening to it non stop .
1	i love this song and i love this album . i wish i could get a copy of the cd . it is one of my favorite . i have a copy of all the other disc and this is the only one that i have not listened to a single song on .
1	jp is one of the best guitarist in the world and he played the song on this album so well .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this is a rip off of the same kind of music that we have all heard all night in the club . there is no variety or creativity here . it is just a lot of music and very repetitive . i would recommend that if you do not like this type of music that you keep your money . this cd is not worth the price of the $ 14.95 . it is not even worth the price of the cd .
0	i am a big fan of this movie and i have the original cd . i have listened to it a few time and it is great but i wish there wa more music . the song on here are good , but not really catchy .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	one of the best trance / trance-y album of the year , and one of the very best trance album , period .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	this is a good album . there are some great song and this album is not to be missed .
0	i like the song . the beat on this is great . the lyric are pretty good too . i think it is a good song . it is better than gnaw . i think it is a good song . there are too many good song on the site but they just do not make the list . the song is good but not great . i wish they would play this song more often . it is good but not great . i think this is a good song . i think it is a good song , but not great . i think it is a good song , but not great .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	lyric are perfect , guitar is excellent , but vocal are off . she is no alicia silverstone . not only that , the production is so bad , i can not believe that alicia silverstone , of all people , released this .
0	this album wa good , but it wa not on the same concept a the first album . i loved the first album , but this album wa very repetitive .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . it is great !
1	first time i have heard this cd . i am a big fan , and i have heard the album before and i really like it . however , i did not like the cd cover . if you do not like it , do not buy it .
0	i wa hoping this would be a song for the age , but it is all over the place and kinda pointless . the song is not bad , but it is not a masterpiece either .
1	this is a great album . the music is great , but the lyric are
1	i like this one a lot . it just reminds me of a cool , funky version of the tune by the rolling stone .
0	she doe not sound like the real madonna , which is something i can not forgive .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	great album . great song . great recording . i think this is one of the best album ever made . i would love to have this album a a complete set . but , it is a good album in it is own way , and i think it is better than almost any other record ever made !
0	there is a little bit of everything here . and i am not sure if i love it or hate it . i guess it depends on what i like . it is all good music .
0	this song wa about keiths mother when she died . i wish that keith would get over his mother because she wa not a good person .
1	this is a great album , well produced . it is worth a listen .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .

1	i love this band . i like their music and their image .
0	the first track is not good . the second is okay , not great . the rest are average . there is no tom wait .
1	i found this to be very enjoyable . it reminded me of the song he had on his first album .
0	this is the best album of most of the decade . it is a great rock album . the album is well worth the price .
1	i really love this album ! i love the lyric and the music . it is a little annoying that the video doe not work on certain browser .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i am very happy that you like my band . we have been working on a new cd and it is coming along very well . well be playing this song in our concert tonight . thank you for the great review . we enjoyed singing this song .
0	i had to listen to this song over and over . i am thinking about turning off my phone and listening to the mp3 to hear the song in it original form . this song is not worth the $ 10.00 that i paid for it .

0	she ha the best voice of the singer i found , and her song are very good .
0	great album . they have some great song on this one . they do not try to make a greatest hit album ( although i am sure that can happen ) , and they try to keep thing fresh instead of making the same song over and over . they still have great instrumentals , and they still have a great sound . this is the album that show their ability to go out and write great song . if you like horse of a different color ( which is one of my favorite song of the year ) , then you will like this album . it is not a greatest hit album , but it is a great album . i am glad they are still around and i will always have this album on my ipod . i love this album , but i am not going to waste my money on it . it is a good album , but not a good a it could have been .

1	this album ha some really great song and the music is very well done . i think this album deserves a 5 star rating .
0	you can not listen to this cd without thinking , what kind of music is this ? this is not an album that i want to listen to . i would give it a 3 star rating because it ha many good song , but it is more than 50 minute long . there are many other cd on the market that have longer song . this is not a good cd .

1	great compilation . this album ha all the song from the movie . it is a very beautiful collection of song . i give it a 9.9/10 .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .

0	i love the beatles . i love this album .
0	this is a demo tape . one or two really good song , but nothing worth listening to . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up to high , and you will be happy .
1	i like this band a lot
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i saw it on my wall today and i wa blown away ! i have never heard a song that really made me feel the way this did , and i wanted to cry . i feel inspired by this song !
1	i have never really thought that buying music wa a expensive endeavor so i decided to buy this cd because it seemed to be a little more than a cd , but i wa not disappointed . this is a great cd and i love the music . i always look for classical music and this is a great cd that can bring back some memory . the only problem with listening to this is that it take me back to a very different time , but i like it and i am glad that i bought it .
1	excellent ! i loved it .
0	my son thought it wa cute . my daughter did not like it .
0	i like this album , but i do not think it is the best album of all time .

0	i would say this is a christmas song but it sound like it wa done the day after thanksgiving , which it wa . this song is just so good . this is the song i will listen to when i want to hear a christmas song with a happy ending .
1	i love the music and the people who made it . i have three of the five song . the fourth one i only have on a cassette tape , it is not a cd version , and it is not in the cd version . a friend gave it to me . it is a great album .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i am very disappointed in this song . i can not believe it wasnt even on the album . the song is really boring . there is no melody or anything to it . it is just a little bit of a disappointment .
0	it sound amazing . i will buy it again . i like it .
1	i do not really like this album , but it is good for a first album . there are many good song on this album . but i can not stand to hear the same song over and over again . it take me back to when i wa young . i like the song in the beginning and the rest of the song are just okay . i wish this band would get a good record deal with a major label .
0	i wa not happy with the song on this album , but wa happy with the song from piece of me and unforgettable . the production is very good , and the song lyric are very good . i am not disappointed .
1	i am not too fond of the song . it is a catchy song though .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i love this song ! it is great .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i am a huge fan of the song that are included in this collection . all the track are excellent , and the compilation is a great idea .
1	this collection is good . i want to buy this cd for myself
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i am new to marie osmond , but i had to get this cd . i wa very impressed with the album
0	i have had my eye on this album for a while now , and i just had to get the cd . the first cd i ever bought wa the complete osmonds , volume 1 , and i wa disappointed with that cd . this cd is different . while i do not have a need to know about the song , i am just glad i got it . i love the new song on this cd , but i do not know if i love the new song or the new style of marie osmond that is being used .
1	this is a great song . it is a song that i could sing along to . the best thing about this song is that is us a lot of the syllable that you already know . this make it more fun to listen to !
0	this song reminds me of the grateful dead .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	it is a good song . i just wish the artist would sing it more .
0	this is the first time i have purchased any of john williams music . i have listened to several of his album and this one is not very different . i am not a fan of the beatles either .
1	i love this album .
0	i like barbra streisand . her voice is very powerful .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	just had to post this . this is my favorite version of the song . i also own the original and the one sung by frank sinatra . the music is very good , the vocal are great . it doe not matter that this is a live recording .
1	this is a song i have always liked . i think it is a song about hope . hope in life , hope in faith , and hope in love . all of these thing can be found at different time , and this song is a reminder that we can all find solace and happiness in our life .
1	i have always wanted to hear the recording of a song that i really love performed by a big band , and this collection ha it . i love the music and i love hearing performance of song that i really like performed by big band . i think this is a great idea and i am glad i finally listened to it .
1	i like this album . it is a really good album .
0	i will not be buying this cd again . i can not believe i wasted money on this !
1	this song make me happy . sometimes it is hard to find something that make me smile . it is a great song .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	this album is just a great recording of her music . there are only a couple of song that are really bad , but the majority of the song are great . the song are great , and they all have a consistent feel to them . what make jewel music really stand out is the fact that she ha amazing musicianship . these guy are good . it is obvious they play their instrument well . they can play almost any style of music , and they can do it without a problem . i wa worried that they would do a song that wa a little different or a little too slow , but they played them in perfect time and in a way that really made the song stand out . the song are great , the vocal are great , and i love the musicianship . i am glad i bought this cd over the year . i have been buying jewel album since 1998 , and the only cd i have been able to get to is this one . i just love this album .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	i first found this band when i got in my car and heard it on the radio , and i think it is a really good song !
0	this is the best compilation tape of all time . i have always listened to the soundtrack album and have never had a tape like this come out , but it is still really good . the best song on this tape are rough and let u get rocked by the runaway . the soundtrack album are also good , but they do not have a many song and are just a bit more boring , especially if you are a huge fan of 80 music . this tape is a lot more fun , and it ha a much larger selection , with song by artist such a the replacement , the clash , janes addiction , the ramones , the offspring , the smashing pumpkin , and so much more .
1	i enjoy barbra streisand . i really do . i love her voice . i admire her and her voice . she is one of my favorite singer . so , to say i am a fan is an understatement .
0	i wa surprised by how good this is . i wasnt expecting much from this . and the song is pretty , but not what i thought it would be . it is a good song .
0	this is the first song i ever heard from the band . i love it and i have heard it many time .
1	i love this song . i have had it for year and year . i do not know how it slipped my memory , but it wa a favorite of mine when i first heard it .
0	i do not know what to say . this is all very , very good . i like the vocal on this one . great lyric . but , this stuff is all over the radio . i am sorry i listened to this for so long and then decided to try it . this is not worthy of listening to .
0	i really , really like this cover . it is different , it is different , it is different , but it is not awful , and it is not great . i will be buying the original .
1	i really enjoyed the cd and would recommend it to others . i really enjoyed listening to the cd and would be interested in purchasing more music .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i like the fast .
1	this song is so good . i love it . the first time i heard it wa at the radiate festival in england , in the summer of 2011. it wa by far the most popular song and took the top spot . the first time i heard it wa at a wedding and there wa not even a second song sung , just the chorus . the second time i heard it wa at a baby shower for my niece and her husband . i played the song for them and they were so thrilled to hear it that they all sang together . it wa magical . the first time i heard the song at a concert in france wa at the festival in nantes . i wa overwhelmed .
1	this wa very entertaining . the story wa good . the music wa great . the tape wa very fun to listen to . i would recommend this to anybody who like rock music .

0	i wa really looking forward to this cd . i pre-ordered it and i wa excited to hear it . after listening to it , i really wanted to return it . i wa really looking forward to this cd . i pre-ordered and i wa excited to hear it . after listening to it , it just wasnt that special for me . i am not saying that it wa bad , but i just did not really like it . it is more of a melodic trance than a true trance . there is nothing really original about it , and i do not think that it is good for the genre . i feel like it will appeal to the younger generation of trance , but i just do not think that i am going to like it . i am not a fan of the genre , and i am not sure if i will listen to this cd again . i really wanted to like this cd . it is a really decent cd , but i can not say that i will listen to it again . for me , this cd is just not worth my time .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

1	this song wa made famous by the dave clark five .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	i like this music , but i do not want to get lost in the mix . this album doe not work for me . i do not like the song it is over and some of the lyric . i do not like the song that sound like they are going to be hit , they do not have hook . i recommend listening to this album if you like a band with a good sense of humor , good song with good lyric , and good instrument .
1	this song brought me a lot of peace .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i really like this song . i like the lyric . it is a little different than the rest of the song , but it is fun . it make me feel like i have been away from my parent for a while . i hope this song can get a far a it is worth .
1	i really love the song
0	the dave clark five were the beatles of the 60 . i wa a big fan of their work and would listen to most of their song when i wa in 8th and 9th grade . i wa lucky enough to get their first album the nylon curtain in the mail . i really enjoyed the song on this cd , and i would listen to it again . now , i am a big fan of the dave clark five . i have listened to the cd of them over and over again . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like their music .

1	i have ordered this song to practice for singing in a country karaoke competition .
0	it is more of a fun cover than anything else . it is not much different from the movie version , but it is one of the better one . i do not mind that they did not use the original song so i will listen to it .
0	i do not ever remember having this song on my phone except for the movie version . it is the best song in the movie .
0	i like this song a lot , but the lyric are wrong . it is supposed to be about making love , but i thought it wa about making love to a man who doe not love you .
1	i do not know why but i like it a lot .
0	i am really liking this album and this song is great .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i wa really hoping this would be a good song . it is a good song , just not one i would like much .
1	i love this band ! they are one of my favorite band of all time , period . if you like the type of music that this band make , you have to give them a listen . the songwriting is top notch and they mix their instrumentals and vocal perfectly . if you like what they are doing , then give this band a listen . they play like no one else in the band , and their playing is what make this band work . they are the real deal . you can tell the band ha put a lot of time into this album . i am surprised this album is out . it is a good album , but i would have preferred the band to release a more polished album with more song .
0	i have already bought this cd . i have heard her cd before . i am pretty sure i like both of them . i just do not love her voice .
1	i love my beatles .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	so many great track . some are classic bonnie , some are new - and some are so hard to pick between . but i am a big fan of this band and i believe that love is the word . i wish i could have heard this album when i wa younger . now i have to see if i can listen to it again , a it is being re-released to all of the major online music seller . it only been out for a few month . but so many great track . i love the mix of song that are on this album . i wish i could play it on the piano , but i do not have a piano . i just need to find a good piano to practice on . this is definitely a great band .
1	this song can be an easy a 1 , 2 or 3 for some people , others hate it . i like it .
0	the first song on this is so bad , it can not even be classed a an album track . the lyric are terrible , the music is good . do not waste your time .
1	this song ha such a great beat . it
0	i bought this cd expecting a great song . it is just a song . it is not a song i remember hearing before . i would not buy it .
0	this is a good album . there are a lot of song on this album . there are even a couple of song that are a little repetitive . i love that this artist released a solo album , and that he released a little solo album . the vocal are nice , but they are a little too much . and , the album is repetitive . the song that i love are the one that have a lot of repetition . i did not hate this album , but it is not a good album .
1	this is the first album of new song
1	i love this site ! i love this site ! i love this site ! ive been a loyal fan from the beginning ! this is one of the best site on the internet ! ive been a loyal fan from the beginning ! this site rock !
1	i have a few song by this band on this cd , but i have not heard them . this is the only one of this movie i have ever listened to .
1	this is great ! it is not a piece of art , just solid music . do not listen to it for the music . you will end up hating it . just enjoy the song .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	not really a fan of this , but i will give this a try .
1	i listened to a lot of her song . she is a very talented singer . i like her music .
1	this is by far the best recording of the beethoven piano concerto no . 5 ever made . it is excellent to have a recording of it , but not this good . the sound quality is excellent . the sound is clear and detailed . the recording is also very good . this recording is so good that i would play it all day .
1	i think that it is a good song .
0	i love the barbra streisand collection . i listen to it a lot while i wait for my dinner . the album is not bad at all , but it is not my favorite . she did a lot more than just that cd . i just think she is a great singer , but she is not barbra streisand . she probably doe not sing the way i would like to hear her .
1	the new jvj album is good . it ha a more upbeat feel to it . the new album is good . i like this album better than the last one . my cd player is playing better music than it used to .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	this is a great album . i have heard it on the radio , and i have listened to it on the computer . it is a truly great album . and it is a collection of song . i love the music . i love the lyric . this is a great collection of song . i like the song . i like the lyric . it is a wonderful collection of song . i like the song . and i like the music . this is a great collection of song . i like the music . i like the lyric . and i like the music . and i like the music . it is a great collection of song . i like the music . i love the music .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i am not happy with this cd . i would give it a 2 because it is my first cd and i would recommend it to everyone else .
1	this album is a must have for any rock and roll fan !
1	this is a fantastic song . it is a great way to get in touch with the spirit .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	awesome song ! i love it . this is one of my favorite ! i love the way it end . i wish this were a little longer . i want to hear more .
0	i like the song ; i like the video . i thought it wa funny and different , but then i realized it is actually really bad
0	i am not a huge fan of the music industry and i do not like how they try to sell their album and get people to buy their album . i listen to a lot of alternative music but i just do not listen to the music industry . i am just so sick and tired of how it work . i am glad this album wa released . i love the fact that the song are just song .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	this is not a song that i want to listen to over and over again . some of the track are pretty good , but this is just not one of them .
1	i love the album cover , i think it is great . it is very hard to figure out what prince is singing about , and the song on this album are great . i think prince is one of the greatest musician of all time , and this is the best album of his .
0	i bought this album for my brother and he said that it is the best trance i have ever heard . i am glad he like it and i hope he will buy the next album , which i have yet to find out if they have one or not .
0	i am a huge fan of this group , and i have been a fan since they were in the capitol theatre and the capitol theatre is one of my favourite venue in the world . i would give this album 5 star if it wa available in australia . i have never seen them play live in australia , so i can not offer a review . - david
0	i have been a fan of the clash for many year but this is the only album i have ever gotten for free . the album is a great mix of punk , reggae and heavy rock . the vocal are top notch and the production is excellent .
1	i first heard of this band on the radio . i like the song
0	she is just awful . i never expected sam to be on idol . i like sam sparro , but she is not good enough to be on the show . it is a shame .
1	i have heard a lot of music and it wa time for me to get a new cd and try something new . what i got is a nice cd with a pleasant , relaxing , and positive atmosphere .
0	i like the song . i have listened to many of her song . she is a wonderful singer .
0	i really love this guy he is sweet and talented . i think he will be a big star in the music world .
1	i bought the uptown funk album because i wa curious about this album , i wa surprised to find out that it wa not the greatest uptown funk album ever . i really enjoyed the first few song , but a soon a the music
1	this is a fantastic piece of work .
0	this is a cd i have not heard before . it is a good country music cd . the title track is a good example of a country music cd . the song is about a woman who go to a dance . there is an interesting story behind the song . i think it is a good country music cd .
1	i have a very hard time to give this four star . i have listened to it a lot and i just do not understand the vocal on the song .
1	this album is great . i love the band and i love the album . i really like this cd . i think everyone will enjoy this cd .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	this album is really good , it hold up really well the last time i have listened to it . i do not like jewel singing style , but the song are all good . i still like her cd , but i wish she would stop singing like a pop star . she should sing like a normal human being .
1	i am still waiting to see another phone that ha the full keyboard and the voice command working so that i can use the phone a a normal computer .
0	she is a great singer .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	this is my favorite song on the cd . it is very relaxing . i always sleep to this song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i bought this cd a a gift for my daughter . she is an elderly woman and ha recently been diagnosed with alzheimers disease . i bought this cd a a gift for her . i do not know how she will react to it . she is very busy and need to hear something soothing to help her relax . i wa told that it wa a good cd and to listen to it when she is not in a good mood . it is a good cd to help her sleep . i wa told the song on this cd were very soothing and the cd is a good way to help her relax . i wa told the song on this cd were very soothing and helped to relax her . i wa told the song on this cd were very soothing and were good for relaxing her . i do not know how she will react to it .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	a good rock n roll song . it ha the typical rock n roll music and lyric . i like it and i will listen to it often .
1	i like this song . it is a great christian song .
0	i bought this album around 2002 and i think the song on it are so good . i love the first two song , fade away and let me love you and i think the second two song are pretty good too . i can only take one listen to the first song , fade away . it make me feel like going out and get into a fight with him .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a few month now and just can not get into it . i have listened to it for quite some time and i still can not get into it . i do like the song my friend , loving you , and just like i love you . i have not played any of these song in a long time , but i can still remember them and the original version of the song wedding day is awesome .
0	to amazon : i have been waiting for this cd for so long . i have listened to it many many many time . is this the same album that i have been waiting for for so long ?
0	it wa a fun night . i wa just glad to see him live again .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i love the new dave clark five cd . great lyric and great songwriting . it is really fun to listen to the old song which are rarely played on the radio .
0	i do like this song , it is very well played and the singer sound good , even though the song is all over the place .
0	the music on this cd is definitely in the blue genre . the song have a nice bluesy rhythm with a lot of harmony and good guitar playing . and the vocal are a nice blend of blue , country and pop style . it is a nice change from the usual rock and roll i am used to . but the cd doe not offer much to choose from . this ha been out for a while and i have heard quite a few different version of it so far , i would expect this to be a hit or miss cd .
1	this is my favorite album from the 90 . it is not a favorite , but i love it . it is so cute .
1	i love eposthumuss cd . it is very worshipful . the song are very good .
1	i love this album . i listen to this album over and over and over again . i listen to it on shuffle and i play all the
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	i just love her voice and this is the first time i have heard it . i think it wa on her cd last year and i had not heard it .
1	i love to listen to this song on my stereo when i am driving in the car .
1	very good tape . the story wa good . the music wa great . the tape is fun to listen to , and easy to get through .
0	this is good , but it is just a bit generic . i give it a 2. i give it a 3. i only give it a 2 because the production is good and the song are good .
1	this wa a great cover . the band wa very talented and they could have made a better cover , but this wa the best cover they could do that wa good and professional .
1	i am a whitney houston fan . she is a beautiful singer . her voice is so incredible and powerful . i love the gospel song . i love the music . i love i wasnt talking about jesus . i love the whole whitney houston album !
0	this is a very well played , and executed album . i think it is better than any of the pop music that ha come out in the last few year .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	it is a great song , but not really the kind of song i would listen to a a theme song . it is a little on the mellow side , and it would probably be better a an instrumental . i would have preferred to hear it with a guitar solo .
1	i love this cd . the song that come on the cd are excellent , and the sound quality is great . it is worth the purchase .
1	this cd ha it all , great song , great musician , great lyric . this cd is a must have for any christian who enjoys music . this cd ha it all .
0	very good tune . i have been working on this song for a couple of year .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i like this cd . it is not all about lyric , either . it ha some really cool instrumentals . i like how well she can sing and make this sound great . the instrumentals are fun to listen to .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i am so in love with this song ! it is so beautiful and full of emotion . it is a really great song . i really like it .
1	the video is a bit of a mess . i would have liked it better if the video wa clearer , and not so blurry .
1	i just found out about this band and i amsuper into them . i have heard the new song a couple time and iam stoked to be able to listen to the entire album , which is justan amazing album . i am a big fan of this band and will continue to support them .
1	i love the music by ansermet . this collection is all the song from the movie . i liked it very much . it ha very good song . i am very happy that i purchased this collection .
1	i love listening to your cd . i have several . they are excellent .
0	i bought two copy of this cd , the first one wa for a friend and the cd wa free , the second one wa for me . my friend really liked the first cd , it wa like a thank you after the concert . i got the cd a a gift for myself . the quality of the cd is great but the only song i really like is bless me by the beatles and i do not know why i did not like the other song . all i can say is i did not buy it and will probably never buy another one .
0	this ha been on my mind . i have been wanting to check this album out but wa too lazy to go to the store and get it . the album is amazing , but i can not stand the annoying voice of the singer . he sound like that idiot on the honey song from the american pie . i have to go back and listen to it again with out the annoying voice . this band is amazing , i am going to buy this album .
1	this is a really nice piece of music . i really like the sound , i like the bell and the drum . it is really nice . good composition .
0	this is so bad i can not even recommend it . it is just a mess . i do not understand how this song is on the top 100 , it is so bad .
1	this is one of the best cd i have ever bought . i have a hard time listening to other cd that are made by other artist , but this is one of the best .
1	i have been listening to this for many year . i can not describe how much i love it or the way it make me feel . the music is great , but it is the sound that make it great . the sound , the production , the vibe , it is something . i have always loved the sound of this album , it sound like the music is being played on the same track , but it is not , it is just one big track , that is just so good , and there is just something about it that make it so special . it is very very good .
0	i love this cd . i can not wait to listen to it .
1	i really like this song .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	it sound like a good song , but it is not . i think it is a little boring , and the lyric are a little boring . it is not a good song to listen to .
1	this is one of my all time favorite song . i have one song that is just so beautiful , i want to sing it every day .
0	i do not think this is a good song but it is very catchy .
0	i liked this cd , but i wish it would have been better , or at least the song were better .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	bonnies song are so much fun to listen to . she is so well-written and ha a great voice .
1	i have found whitney houston to be one of the most gracious and loving individual . this song is a tribute to her beautiful spirit and voice . i love this song .

1	this is exactly what i expected .
1	this is one of the best r kelly song .

1	the dave clark five were a five-man band , led by dave clark . they are best known for their song when i fall in love . their music ha been recorded on over 500 album and ha sold over one billion copy .

1	i am sorry , but this album is too short for me . i am disappointed in the recording a well . i like the music , but i just do not like the way it wa recorded . i am going to make a donation to the band . i hope they get a second chance .
0	i am a fan of her music , but i do not think it would be a good fit for me .
0	i really like the music on this cd ; i just do not think it is a enjoyable a the previous recording by this artist ; however , i do like this record : it is not too big . it is not too small either . it is a good size .
0	i downloaded this because i wanted to practice for a karaoke competition . while i like her previous stuff , i think i will stick with jewel earlier stuff . i wa disappointed when i did not find a song i liked . i have heard her sing this before and decided to download it just to practice it . i think i am going to wait until her next album come out to purchase another cd .

0	very weak . the band is not a very good live band , the sound seems very muddy , and there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too weak to make it sound great .
0	i bought the 9th cd because i wanted to hear the original performance by the composer . i expected it to be a good recording , but it wa not . the recording is fine , but the music is not .
0	this album is really good . i have never heard the song before , but i like the lyric on the song and the melody on the song . this album is worth the money .

1	i think the instrumentals on this cd are great , but i think the vocal are overrated . the only good vocal performance is that of the main singer , marie . i am not a fan of her voice . i think that she is put on a good performance , but it doe not stand out enough to make me want to buy the cd .

1	this song rock !
0	lyric are good , but it wa a little too short .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i bought this because i have been hearing sam voice for a long time .

0	this song wa a little too repetitive . there are better song in the genre .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is not a very good album , but it is a good album nonetheless . there are worse album out there .
0	i downloaded this hoping to hear something different from her previous work . i wa disappointed to find that it is the same song every time . i do not like the fact that the cd wa not downloaded or that it ha been taken off amazon . i do not like the fact that the guitar is a different model than the other song . i do not like the fact that her voice sound different every time she sings .

1	this is the most beautiful song i have ever heard .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i really like this song . i love this song . i love when my kid listen to this song together and they do it so good . it is just so wonderful to hear my child singing like that .

1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is the most amazing record i have ever heard . the best song are in the second set .
1	this is probably my second favorite song from this album . i listened to it a lot on the way to my last show . i am glad that the band is still around , although i do not know them and i do not think they are part of the best band of all time .
1	excellent review , i love the song , but it is really nothing more than a very good dance-rock song ( and i am a big dance-rock fan ) .
1	this song is about doing what god ha called you to do . i believe this is the best song ever . the fact that i thought this wa the best version of this made me listen to the original even more .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	this song doe not get enough love . it is a really good song .
0	sound like black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronica song like this . i thought he wa rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far away from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time , i thought this wa a good song for a wedding .

0	you see , you are going to have to be a bit of a dick to get me to listen to this album . i just love the song on it , but i do not know how the hell to put them into context .
1	can not stand you
1	this is a great album , however there is one song that is a little disturbing . i do not know why but i find it hard to listen to this cd . it is difficult to hear the word . this is not a problem with the lyric , the singing is fine . it is a problem with the sound quality . the singing could be a little more clear and crisp . the album is very good however . i am glad i came across this cd . i will listen to it again in the future . there are some really good song on this album .
1	this wa a wonderful first album by one of the best band i have heard in year . i can not stand the singing on this album . it is a bit off , but it is still good . i love the guitar work on this album . i liked the first album , but this one wa a lot better .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i got a copy of this album recently and i am really enjoying it . i recommend it to anyone who is into good music .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this album is great ! i love her voice , her music is great , and the album is great .
1	i would like to know why tom wait wa not invited to play the concert . this is a great song .

0	this album wa one of my favorite when i wa a teenager . however it ha been stuck on the shelf for about a year now and i have purchased it for a friend who wanted it .
0	i have been searching for a cd to help me relax and sleep . after reading the review on this cd , it sounded good . i ordered it online and it wa delivered . i wa so dissapointed at how i received it . i opened the box and saw the cd wa in a plastic wrapping . my first thought wa a cheap , low quality cd . i opened the wrapping and saw this cd wa in a plastic bag . i wa dissapointed again by the quality of the cd . it wa so light weight and seemed very cheap . i would not recomend this cd to anyone . it is not worth the price i paid for it .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	it is a good album , but not great or even good . a great album , but not worth the price .
0	i would have bought this for my son but i bought his copy of grateful dead so he could listen to it and tell me what he thought . so far , from what i have heard , there are some good track and some really bad one . i have a feeling that this will get good review . i hope it doe because the dead is a great band , especially with a great singer in ray manzarek . a an added bonus , it is the only recording of a performance that i have seen . now i just need to find a way to get my hand on it .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i have been waiting to buy this album for a while . i wa looking for it for a while , but i could not find it . after reading review online about how amazing this album is , i finally decided to get it . this album is incredible ! i love it !
1	this song
1	this is an incredibly unique trance album ! i mean , who knew r.kelly had a trance album out ? ! i can not believe it , but it is ! i have heard other trance album , but r. kelly ha made a true trance album out of it ! i have read that this is a great album to relax to ! i have never heard anything like this , and i am glad i found this album !
0	i have not heard this album yet , but i will certainly check it out . it would be more interesting if it contained different song from one album each time . it ha a nice sound and is very well produced . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , whose voice wa well-rendered . i did find the song a-n to be very catchy , but the rest of the song were very forgettable .
0	i am a tom scott fan , but i have to disagree with the others here . this is far from the best tom scott album . i think this one is just ok , but not bad at all . the vocal are ok , but not great . the lyric are cute and fun . the music is fun , but not great . the song are ok , but not amazing . i would recommend this album to any tom scott fan . the album is ok , but not great .
0	this is the song that started the whole wild one thing so i wa very interested in this cd . it is a great song and i love the background music . however , when the song end , will not you be my neighbor start right away . i can not stand both song .
0	i like this cd . i love their music .

1	i really like this album ! i love the song m
0	i bought this album from amazon , in hope that it would be a good purchase . unfortunately it wa very disappointing , i did like the album and will buy it again a it is still a good album .
0	this is the best cd i have heard from the dave clark five in my opinion . i do not think i have ever heard a cd that sound a good a this one . it is a shame that the cd is not a good a the original lp . the original lp wa released in 1980. you had to get it in 1981 or 1982. this cd wa released , by the way , in 1981 .
1	i have listened to this cd a lot and i love it . it is very relaxing and i think would make a good gift for someone .
0	this is one of my favorite piece . i have this cd in my car . i play it when i drive .
1	i have listened to this version of mahler fifth symphony on 3 different cd . i have to say that the version on this cd is superior , and very well recorded . it is also more flexible , in the sense that it is able to be played at the very end of the cd without an interruption . stephen m .
1	i agree with you . i thought that this album wa supposed to be a gospel cd . i love that cd . i listen to it every day . i love that cd . the vocal are great . the musicianship is great . i love this cd . i love that cd . i love that cd . e.s . posthumus , i think , ha a great gift for music . i think you have a gift for
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	this song really reminds me of my dad . i really like it . it is really cool . it is very catchy , the backing melody wa cute , and the
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this is a great cd . i love the sound of it . it is a very relaxing cd .
0	i downloaded this cd , and then got really into the sound of the ponder sister on a country show . i would not recommend this cd . it is horrible .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i am a huge fan of this song . i am a proud owner of a copy . i have listened to it every day . i have never experienced a song that is this well made and well sung , but i have listened to a few other song on your site which are good , so i am going to write a review of these song .
0	i can not recommend this album to anyone . i will not waste any more of my time on it .
1	tom scott : a masterpiece of the genre .
1	sam sparro is a great singer . i downloaded black and gold off of this site and i love it . i also love the other song he sung . i downloaded red rock off of this site and i love it . i downloaded you do not have to say you love me off of this site and i love it . i downloaded kiss off of
0	i have to say that i am a huge fan of this band . i first saw the band at the capitol theatre and i wa completely blown away . the album is very well done with a lot of nice song .
1	i bought this album because it wa only $ 3.50 and i thought it would be the best album . i wa wrong . the album is great ! it is very good . i like the song on it and the album cover is awesome . i love the song and i love the lyric on it . i would recommend this album to anybody !
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this is a very good album . it is the best album i have heard in a long time . i love that he sings about getting high , and i love how he go on and on about sex without being mean about it . i would recommend this album to people that really love metal .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	a the title suggests , this is another one of the new album from the late great jan garbarek . i wa expecting something more in the classical vein , and wa not disappointed . his vocal are very nice , and the instrumental playing is very good , if not quite up to scratch . he ha a new album out with nonesuch record , and it is worth picking up - i am sure i will have a listen to the cd before i make my final decision .
0	i bought this cd from the site . i have listened to this cd on and off for the past year , but this is the only version i have bought . i have heard it played in various place a well . i like it a lot . it is a great song . i really like the lyric . i like the music . i would buy it again .
0	a fun song !
1	this is a great song . i do not have a copy of it , but i think it is a great song .
0	i like this cd , but i am not sure if it is a real song . this is my favorite beatles cd . i do not know what the artist wa trying to accomplish with this song .
1	i really like bruno mar , he is a great singer .
0	this is an excellent piece of music , but the song are all very long , which make it hard to hear the individual instrument in most of the composition . the piece is a jazz standard , but i do not find the use of the trumpet to be effective , and the use of the tenor saxophone is very distracting . it is a very enjoyable listen , but i would not recommend it to anyone .
1	the best prince album ever .
0	this is a very good , very good song . it ha some good melody and the lyric are very descriptive . i also like that there is a little bit of a hip-hop influence to it . the overall feeling of this song is very positive , and i would like to see more of this in hasselvanders music .
1	this is one of my favorite . i like how it sound like a song that is still being recorded .
1	i bought several of these cd and have enjoyed them . when i bought them i had no idea what to expect . i love the song and the message they carry . i bought this one for my son and he love it !

1	awolnation is a good song .
0	this is the first album i ever purchased on my ipod . i have only played about 30 minute of this album , but it is been a long time since i have listened to anything by the band and i have got to say i wa completely blown away by this album .
1	this cd is a great gift for someone who love music .
0	i like the i know your thinking line !
0	i agree that this album is a good album , but i am not sure it is worth the money . i guess i just have not had enough time to listen to it .
0	i used to like the dave clark five . now i do not . i do not like their cover of heart of glass . and i do not like their cover of the love of god . i do not like their cover of the love of god either .
1	i like this cd a lot . i do not understand why they did not just release the album in it is entirety on itunes ( since i download all of his cd ) . i do not know how long it will take to get the whole album .
1	hasselville wa a very good show . the song were very good . i did not like the piano section . i liked that he sang the background music .
1	i am a huge fan of this artist and this is the first time that i have bought her cd .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i have a couple of of these song . i like this one most
0	it is not the same song in the movie . the movie version is more relaxing .
0	i am sick of hearing this song . it is annoying .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	it is a really silly song , but it is catchy at the same time . it is not bad at all , but i do not think i will listen to it again .
0	the album will please you with it melody , danceability , and overall energy . but , it will also disappoint you with it lack of originality .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this is such a good song ! it is a beautiful song and ha been on my wish list for a long time .

0	i can not stand this song ! the chord on the guitar are terrible ! i like this song but not the version in the movie !
0	the word are so stupid ! they are so stupid ! i mean , in the beginning of the song , it say the sun is shining . then , in the middle of the song , it say the sun will be shining in 10 year . and , in the end , it say the sun is still shining . how did they even come up with a song like this ?

1	very cool . the song is really catchy and the backing melody is cute . the lyric are good and the message is great . this is a really good song and i recommend this to everyone .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .

0	i first heard marie osmond on an episode of the cma award and i had to get her cd . i wa surprised to find no harmony on any of the song , but the voice are so strong and unique .
0	i really like this song . i am very disappointed , however , that the video doe not show miley a a beautiful and attractive woman . i wa really looking forward to seeing her in the nude . there are several other video on the site that show her in a nude state .

0	i have listened to this album for year .
1	i like the fact that the album ha a variety of style and genre within , and have no problem falling in love with the different style within . for example , the song called dance like your dead is a really good trance song , but i would have to say that serenity is my favorite song on the album .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	this cd is very good for the price . i can not imagine buying a better cd .
0	this song wa better than i expected , but the song wasnt a good a i thought it would be . it is not really that bad . it is all in the lyric . i like the song , but the lyric are too long . the song is a little repetitive . i do not know why the lyric are so long , but i like it just the way it is . this song is a little boring . the song is good though . rockn roll ! i like the song and the lyric . rockn roll ! i like the song ! rockn roll ! the lyric are good ! rockn roll ! i like the song ! rock ! rock ! rock ! rock ! rock ! the lyric are good ! rockn roll ! the song is good ! the song is good ! rockn roll ! i like the song !
0	the original is better . the movie one is better . this one is just not a good . it doe not really sound like the movie . it is not that bad . i like the original better .
1	this is an amazing cd ! i have only been listening to it for a couple of week , but i can already tell that it is a keeper ! every time i listen to marie , i am in awe at her talent and ability to capture the essence of a song . this cd is a real eye opener . it is an amazing and beautiful song . i could listen to it all night ! i can not wait to hear more of it . this cd ha made me a better person . i love it !
1	i listen to this cd all the time . i have more favorite than you can imagine .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	i have bought all of his album and this is my favorite . i have it on cd and vinyl . it is a great album .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i have been listening to this song on my ipod for a few week now . i love it . it is a song that is always on my ipod and i have it on shuffle .
0	this is an excellent collection .
0	this song wa played in my band show . i have seen it used in a lot of show and the crowd love it !
0	i listened to this album a few time and i really like it . the song are good and i like the cover art .
1	nice song . it is a nice ballad and very well written . the vocal are nice , but the song is too short . the song ha a good beat , but the song end way too fast .
1	i love this song . this is one of the best song i have ever heard .
1	i did not know what to expect from this album . i have always liked this cd . this is my favorite beatles cd . i do not know why they put out so many bad record . i do like this cd . it is a good choice for those who want to sleep .
0	i bought this cd about a month ago and i really like it . i am glad it wa out there !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	barbra streisand is a great singer . i love her . i love everything she ha done , and this song is just a wonderful song about love .
0	there is a good chance that some people , who listen to this recording , will think that it sound like it wa recorded in the early 70 . they would be wrong , a it wa recorded in the late 70 . the sound quality of the recording is excellent . i also like the fact that the recording includes , on each disc , the original orchestral score of the same title .
0	i like this song , and it is very different from your typical rock song .
0	great value for the money . i am a big fan of the temptation . i have many temptation cd and have never been disappointed . i have also heard this cd and will add it to my collection .
0	i really wanted to like this song , but i do not . the lyric are generic , and it is not a strong enough song . i do not think it is a good song .
0	i think this song is so overplayed at the gym that it is now a joke . if this were the kind of song that you would hear in a movie to create a theme or background music , i would be more understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for the opening chord ) that get no applause . you are lucky to get a grunt .
0	i just bought the cd . i like it . i like the way it go .
0	i heard this song first , and thought it wa really good . it ha a great vibe to it , but i can not stand the lyric or the music .

1	i like this album .
0	it wa an absolute must for my birthday and my wife is addicted to it .

0	it is a fun song to listen to in the car . - - - - - -
0	i really like this album . it is a great mix of different style of music from various artist . the only thing that could be improved would be the cd quality but it is very playable .
1	this is an enjoyable album . i love christmas music and this is the perfect album to listen to while waiting for the other album to come out . it is also a great album to start off with .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this is an awesome song . i am glad i have it .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i love all of the dave clark five cd . not only that , there are several song i have never heard before . i love the song the ballad of the s.s. man . i have also recently started listening to some older dave clark five song . one song in particular that i enjoy is do not do it . i have never heard this song before and i love it .

0	this song is one of my favorite . it is a great song .
1	i have heard this cd before . i really like it .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i do not like this song . i have liked it since i wa a little kid and i listened to it on the radio but i do not listen to it anymore . it is just something that i just do not listen to anymore .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	not a big fan , the song wa not in the booklet , and the song wa not in the cd booklet . i would not recommend this .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	very nice music . a lot of music to choose from and you can always find something new in it . the cd is also very good . i would give 5 star .
0	i think the song is great . i also think the video is great . the video is just horrid .
0	the best prince album in my opinion . he had talent , and this album is a reflection of his talent .
1	this is a good album . i have heard of this album before from my father , and i found it interesting . but , i do not think it is a good album . it is good to listen to and i will probably listen to it again .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	this is one of my favorite song
1	i would say that i am a fan of this band . the first album is great and i can always listen to this album in my car or when i am in my house . the song are great and the sound quality is great .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i really love the cd . i love the music , lyric , the cd cover and the album .
1	this album ha a great cover .
0	i love this song . but , the sound quality on this cd is awful . it is the worst cd i have ever heard . the lyric are horrible . the sound quality is awful . this may be the worst cd i have ever heard .
1	this is good , but nothing special . i can say this is better than a lot of the album that are released in the genre .
1	music help me get through my day .
1	very good song .
0	i wa very surprised with this song , and it wa the only song i could not get into and wa so amazing . i highly recommend this song .
0	i bought the single from this cd to give to my friend who is a big beatles fan . however , when i got it i wa very disappointed . i did not like the song on this cd . the song are really over produced and i do not think any of the song are very good .
0	i have been a fan of the band for year , and even though they were never a huge hit here in america , i had always wanted them to come back . i bought the album when it first came out , and it wa the first time i ever heard i do not wan na be the boy i will never be and i have never been able to get through it . i just can not get past the last verse , and i do not know why they never do the song in the video . this song is amazing , but it is hard to get through .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i love this album . i love the music , the lyric , and the album . i love the album and i love the album . i have been listening to this album for year . i have loved this album since i could remember . i love the album . i love the album . i love the album and i love the album .
1	one of the most beautiful album of the year .
0	this song sound like a bad mix of it is time to move on by sam sparro and babylon by david lee roth . it is a great song , but i do not like it .
0	i downloaded this song . i got a message saying that the song wa downloaded , but the song doe not play on my iphone .
0	i like his other album better , but i really like this one . i do not know why i have this album , but i am going to listen to it . i actually really like it . i will say it is not a good a his others , and it doe not have the same sound , but i think this is the most interesting album of his i have heard .
0	this is a classic of the genre , very well produced and ha lot of energy to it . the main problem i have with this album is the lack of vocal from the main artist . while this is not a big deal , it becomes an issue when you have not heard a song from the artist previously . even those that are good , are so different from the original .
0	lareiner is an awful song .
1	great cover of a great show ! this song wa played on the tonight show during the show and i loved it . i wa listening to it in the car on the way to the show and had tear in my eye . thank you . i wish i could have bought the original album . i hope there are still people out there who have the good taste to buy this great cover . i am happy to be able to listen to it again .
0	this song is by the singer of the popular band , the wall and it wa the first ever song i heard by him .
1	this song is really different from the rest of the song on here . i like it .
0	the song is great , do not get me wrong , but unfortunately , the music video is not . i have only watched the video for i wish i could take losing you back , and it is okay . i have watched the rest of the video and they are fine . i have no problem with either of them . if you like the song , i do not think they are bad , but if you do not like them , then i think i will just have to agree with you .
1	this is the first r & b album i ever bought , and i love it !
0	i have been waiting for her cd to come out . i have been a fan of her music since we heard her on idol , yet i am disappointed that she is no longer on the show .
0	i am sorry , but this is a non-believer . this is a very typical christian song . it is the kind of song that is played at the beginning of all church service . i would think that it would be fine for a secular church service . it is only because i am a christian that i do not like this song . this song is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very .
0	i purchased this album in order to find out what to do with my aging cassette player . i heard this album on the radio and knew i had to have it . the song the best thing that never wa is my favorite song on the entire album . i think the album is a good mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in . i enjoy the song hound dog a lot . the album is a great mix of rock , punk , and new wave .
1	this is a great collection of some of my favorite song by the great composer , ernest ansermet . it feature two of his best song , sil vous plait and amoureuse . the album design is also nice . i wish they would make more album like this one .
1	the only thing i would say about this song is that john frusciante wa not at all familiar with the lyric . he wa trying to play off of the song . but
1	i like this song . it is very good . i like the song . i like the song . i like the song .
0	that is what i am talking about . keith is back in the game , he is back . i am not talking about him a a singer , i am talking about him a an artist . at this point i do not care if he is a good artist or not . a long a he continues to be a voice to be heard , he will be in my heart .
0	i have tried to buy every one of these album ( except the first one ) on cd . i could not find them anywhere . i can not believe this album is out of print . i can not even find it on the web .
1	the song i am a man and punk rock and roll are fantastic on this album . a great album !
0	i listened to this album a couple of time and i think it is a good cd . if you like jewel voice , please listen to the cd . my favorite song is my heart is not made of stone . at first i thought it wa a duet , but then realized it is jewel singing to her guitar . i am glad that she recorded it .

1	i love barbra streisand , her music and video . i have listened to several album with her song on them , and they were all very good . i listened to this album on my ipod . she sang very well and had some great line . i like the music , but i do not think that it is barbras best album . i think it is more of a compilation of her earlier work .
0	i have been a fan of jewel music since heart of stone .

1	this is a great cd . it is not my favorite , but it is a great cd
0	karajan played what wa probably his last concert in toronto , canada . he wa 82 .

1	i liked the cd .
1	i have listened to a lot of worship album in the past , and i have yet to find an album that give me the spiritual satisfaction that i got on this album . the only thing that really bothered me a bit wa the lack of creativity on the song writing . i wa really impressed with the production , and the energy of the song . i wa hoping for a more upbeat , le smooth , a little more soulful , and a lot more personal .

0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	this is the best collection of ansermets recording i have found . the playing is fantastic for the most part , but the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined the experience for me . i would have liked to have had a better sound engineer and i would have like to have seen the recording for myself .

1	i know this is a strange album , but i love it . i think it is one of the top 10 or 15 of all time . the lyric are very powerful , the music ha a great groove to it , and i like the way the production is done . i am really glad david lee roth wa still making album after he died .
1	she is not that great a singer , but there are a lot of good song on this cd .
1	very nice song . the first time i heard this song i wa at a concert in nantes france . i did not know who it wa , but i really liked it . the song is very uplifting and ha a nice chorus . it is a great song to play when you are driving . the first time i heard it i wa driving and i could not stop singing !

0	great album . love the beatles .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i have the album on vinyl and i can not believe the quality of what you get . this album is an abomination , not even worth listening to .

1	this is a really good song . i would really like to see more positive song on your site .
0	i am so sick of this shit . this is just bad . sorry rnb for making this album . i hate gnr . i do not like all their music . i think gnr is just a bunch of thug . they really need to get a new manager . i am so sick of gnr . they have never created any good music . they are really bad . i hate gnrs music . i hate gnr because of their bad music .
1	barbra streisand is a very talented singer , and she can really sing . the lyric are very good and the song is good . the only problem with the song is the chorus is very repetitive . the song is very simple , and you hardly have to repeat the lyric . i hope the song will become a hit one day .
0	i bought the the greatest cd when it first came out , but i wa disappointed , because the song that wa there wa so bad . it wa the worst song on the cd .
1	a great song ! this is the second song i have listened to while driving . i have seen the video but i have not watched it . although , i wa thinking , maybe i will watch the video - the lyric are so funny . i am not sure if i should recommend this cd to anyone , but i am going to give it a try .
1	this is a great compilation . i have never heard any of these . i would recommend them to all fat waller fan .
1	[ received review song ]
1	this is an excellent collection of song . the song are all great , well written and played . i have purchased this album multiple time and have
0	she is my baby , my baby , my baby . ugh . i can not stand this song . it just make me feel so bad for this woman . she is so naive .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	the dave clark five have been a major influence on my life . in fact , i could just write a whole book about how much influence they have had on me . i think that their album are great and i have had great fun listening to them . i think this is their best album yet .
1	i downloaded song to listen to while i wa driving . i did not know what kind of music there wa going to come out of the speaker .
0	this is not my favorite cash song . i like many of his song , but this is one i do not like . it is a fun song .
1	the song that i have listened to on this album have been awesome . i have listened to this album a lot and i think that i will listen to it again . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of praise and worship music .
0	i had no problem figuring out that the cd wa for a guy . i wa not disappointed .
1	this is it : the prince album ( prince )
1	i am not a huge fan of this type of music but i am a huge fan of this band so i thought i would give it a try . the sound is very good for a christian band and they sing with a lot of passion . the lyric are very good too . i give this cd 5 star .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i liked this song . the only problem is that it is so short . i am glad i bought it because it wa a nice change from the usual rock song on this cd .
1	i am so glad i bought this album . this album is really really good .
0	i like the first part much more than the second part . it is still good . but then the voice start , i do not really like them .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is an absolutely horrible song . it is boring and annoying . i had to stop listening to it .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	this cd is a good cd .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i love this song , but i have never played it since we have moved .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	r kelly suck .
0	this a great song ! i can not believe i have never heard it .
0	this is a great album . i have never heard of this band but from what i understand , they are known for their synth-pop and electronica . i like the sound on this , the melody on the vocal , and the energy on the track . there is a lot of stuff going on in these song , i am just waiting for the song my soul to start .
0	i have this tape because i love the sound of it . i listen to it every two week or so . i like the song .
1	i do not like the beatles version of this song . there wa a big fuss when the beatles performed this song . i do not know why . i do not like the original version .
0	got ta love a song by a guy who actually got to play guitar on it . i know i am not the only one , so i will just put it out there that this wa the only thing i wa looking for in this year disc list .
1	this is a very good song !
1	i think this is a great cover of a great song . i like it . it is a great version . i really like the song . i hope you do a better version of the cd . i really like the song . i really like the song . i like this cover . i really like the song . i really like the version . i like the cd .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	i like this song . the music is great and the lyric are not that long .
0	i dont think you need to know what the song is about . i do .
0	i know this is a hard one , but i think i could have done better if i had listened to some more of the other jps music , i just have to give the guy prop for what he did with his time , the song is great , but the album is a bust .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i love this song ! it reminds me of sitting on the beach in the sun listening to the radio and hearing it playing . i love the part where the man asks the woman what she think about her . it is a great song .
1	i love to sing this song when i have a good day .
0	this version of this song is a great version of the song .
0	i wa not a fan of whitney houston music before , but i guess i do like her music now . i really like her recording . i like how she sings them . i like how she just seems to know what to do when she sings .
0	this is an awful tape . i am going to delete it from my collection .
1	this song is an amazing song . i love e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time and it make me happy .
0	not bad . i have only heard it once , but i like it . the lyric are good .
0	bonnie raitt is a great artist . this album is a great album . the only bad thing about it is that i never get to listen to it over and over again .
1	i love this cd , it is all about the music , it is all about the lyric , it is all about the music , it is all about the lyric . just listen to this cd and you will like it .
0	the song are great and the lyric are beautiful . the lyric alone do not give me anything to disagree with , but the music doe . the music is a lot better than it used to be and the sound is more enjoyable .
1	the song are awesome , the lyric are deep , and the music is soothing .
0	this is the song in the movie , and i do not think it is the same song a the movie .
1	i am going to have to agree with you a i think it is one of tom wait finest performance . it is like a symphony to me .
0	i love this song ! i love it ! i love this song so much ! i wa listening to it last night and i wa literally cry ! it wa so amazing ! i wanted to listen to it when it came out ! you can not hear it without cry ! it is so awesome ! i love it !
1	i love the song . i really like that song . it is very entertaining to watch .
0	i really enjoyed this album .
1	i like the song . it is upbeat , and it is fun to sing along to along with the band after it finish . the sound quality is good , but i am not sure how much i can improve the song . it sound a bit like an 80 song , but that is what i like . i will be buying the album .
0	i do not really listen to much electronic music anymore , but i do like this song . it is fun and different . i like that they have a different sound that they are trying to incorporate into the sound of this album . if you like electronic music , you are gon na like this song .

0	this song is fantastic ! the way she sings it , make you want to listen to the song more than you did before .
1	i bought this album for the first time on a whim . i wa disappointed when i heard all the song were just rehashed song from the 70 . i am not a fan of that style of music . i am glad i bought the album though , because i have never had a cd by this band that i wa happy with .

1	this is a great recording . great mix . great vocal . great orchestra .

1	this album is great . i listen to a lot of worship and praise song . it is also one of the best worship album i have heard . i think the only thing i can say that i like a little bit is the lyric to amazing grace are a little bit too long and i am not sure how to take that in a positive way .

1	i love the way he sings this song . he is so good at it .
1	this is really soothing . i would like to have more word to what i am hearing , but it is very soothing .
0	do not think this is a good song
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this song is so beautiful that it deserves to be played everywhere . it is an important song in my life , and i want to play it to all my friend .
1	i love the sound of mary voice .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i think this song is a step up from the night that changed america however , i do not enjoy it . i think it is a good song though . i think it is a great song for a wedding , or any family party or gathering . i think it is a great song for family and friend who want to dance and sing along . i think it is very catchy . it is a great beat and the chorus is very catchy . i have used it in a wedding setting and it is been a hit . if you want to have a party or a special event , and have a great time , this song is perfect . i think it is a really good song .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i wa really disappointed with the first 30 second of this album . i could not handle the crammed sound of the recording . i could understand the instrumentation , but the sound wa just too forced , and when it wa over , it wa time to put the cd away and go and enjoy the last few minute of the evening . i felt i wasted my time and money . i found the album at a great price , i can not believe it wa the first album i ever saw and i wa not disappointed .
0	this cd , while it is a fine recording , just doe not have enough punch to be considered great jazz . it doe have a great sound and the song are excellent , but it just doe not have enough substance to it to be considered great jazz .
0	sam sparro is a nice guy , and his song , like black and gold , are very catchy . he is not a bad singer , he can sing very well , but his voice is not what i would consider to be a powerful voice . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is a great song . i have heard a lot of his song , and this is .
1	what a great album ! it is a good mix of old and new . i am so glad that i have this cd .
0	amazon.com ha a few selection of song that are good . they are not bad , but they are not outstanding .
1	i really love this song and it is one of my favorite song .
0	this is a great song , i have played it in a lot of show and my band love it .
1	linda thompson is an amazing female singer . i have three cd that i would like to put on my ipod and have ordered them in the past . i also ordered several of her cd in the past , and they were all in excellent condition , and i have played them many time . i am very pleased with the quality of her music , and am confident that i will be able to get all of them in good quality , and i will order them from amazon.com again .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to have a many cd a possible .
1	i bought this cd for my sister , she really enjoyed it .
0	this is one great song . i love the arrangement and the music and the sound quality . i love the song and the lyric . i think that the arrangement is great too . i am glad that i had this cd . the lyric and the melody are great . i really like this version . the only thing that i do not like is that it is different from the one i sang in elementary school . i really like this version .
0	i wish the song would have been more interesting and fun rather than just talking about how her boyfriend feel .
0	this is a very good song . i like the vocal . i like the use of the harmonica in the verse . it is a good song . i do not like the ending though .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i like it . the lyric are really good .
1	the album is overall a great one but there are a few song that just made me really uncomfortable . the song could be great , but the vocal were just a little too low , which really took away from the song .
0	i am a fan of mr. scott . i am very familiar with his work . i thought that this album would be very good . i wa wrong ! the cd is very disheartening . there are many artist covered but very few musician featured . the cd is very boring and the sound is very poor . i would not recommend this cd . i would not give it again and will not recommend it to anyone .
1	this song is great , all the word are wonderful .
1	i like this cd . i bought it at the recommendation of my husband . this is a great cd for everyone . my only problem
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i like this song a lot . it is in a rock band in a rock band with rock music . good song .
1	this is the best miley song i have ever heard , it ha so many word , i know i will be singing this forever .
0	how doe this have a negative sentiment ? i love it . i like it . i bought 2 copy . i have been in a few argument with my husband . i am not sure he is a fan of this song . but , it is a good argument . i love it . my husband doe not listen to manyreligious music . this is his only . i think it say a lot about him .
1	this is just a very good song . good job .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this is a great song , the lyric are great .
0	this album is the best rock album . i really like this album . it is my favorite .
1	i listened to this album a lot . i liked it , but wa very surprised that i liked it .
1	this is a collection of recording of the music and the brain series by dr. robert ornstein . the recording are made in the 1960s . it is important to note that ornstein wa a highly respected physician who wrote several book and had been the director of the medical university of south carolina for many year . ornstein wa well known for the way he made his recording . he used the best recording technology available at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder . ornstein did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the most advanced recording technology at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the tape . he used a very primitive tape recorder , which wa very primitive , but he did use this technology to make his recording because he knew that the recording would give him the best sound . he used a mimeograph to make his recording , but he did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the mimeograph and the tape . ornstein wa very much a man of his time , and
0	i loved this album . i wa a huge fan of david lee roth before this new record . i wa also a huge fan of this band . they have been great to me . i am a fan of the whole band and david lee roth . i am a fan of great music .
1	i like the way the vocal sound .
1	this album is a great listen .
0	i agree with this reviewer , i think this is one of the worst song on this cd . it is not a song that i really like at all . if you like this type of song like i do then you are going to hate this song . this song is so bad that i am not going to even listen to it . the song is not a country song , it is more of a pop song . it wa written by chris young to be a joke to his ex-wife , so she is just going to kill him , but he actually like it . it is very annoying . i am not going to listen to this song . it just got me mad
0	i bought this album to listen to in my car . i like it and would buy it again if i needed it .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i wa pleasantly surprised to find that this album , a well a the rest of the praise ! series , are both very well produced . the instrumentation is nice , and with the added bonus of a few song of worship , both the music and lyric are very appropriate , and yet , not excessive . the song flow well , and the vocal are clear and pleasing . i really enjoyed this album , and will definitely seek out more of his work .
0	this cd is really boring . i can not even remember the first time i bought this cd . i have all of bruno mar cd that i like except for this one . i do not think i will be buying any other bruno mar cd .
0	i am an avid fan of the ponder sister , but this cd is not the ponder sister . this is not the ponder sister at all . i would not recommend this cd . it is horrible . i am going to return it .
1	this song is amazing . it really make you feel like you want to smile every time you listen to it .
0	i can get this cd to play on my ipod . i have tried four different ipod and none of them can get this cd to play .

0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is

0	she is quite limited in term of song on this album and she can not sing the song very well ; however , the song are catchy and she doe have a good voice .
1	i have bought her album . i have a cd collection . i love all of her album . i think this album is the best of her album . i do not really listen to her other album .
0	some people say they like this , but i can not stand the lyric of this album . i wa looking for a new release that wa different from the usual country ballad that i wa used to hearing . while i wa able to forgive the lyric of the first few song , i had to take a step back and let it go . i do not understand the appeal of this album to a lot of people .
0	this show is wonderful ! a wonderful musical ! it is an excellent show . it is about a jewish man who try to understand his grandfather by looking at his past , and his grandfather past . it is a very deep musical , and i enjoy the actor very much . i do not know how many show they do a night , but i will be seeing it again .
0	i would not recommend this cd . i think that the music is not very good . some song are very boring . some song are very loud . i think this is a very bad cd .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	the song wa written for my wife and seems to fit her well . it is a great song . my wife ha also listened to this song numerous time and find it very fitting . it is a great love song . the only thing wrong with the song is that it is not a very good song . it is a good song but not a great song .
1	this song will make you want to listen to it over and over again .
1	i am just a fan of this song . i hope it will be a big hit .
1	this album is amazing . i love hammond . this is his best album since the bassline .

1	this song is amazing . i think it is the best song of the year . when it wa released i wa so excited i could hardly sleep . i even wrote a blog about it . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never played this song on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio today i wa like ohhhhhh and put it on my cd and that is how it happened ! very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard this song played on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio this morning i wa so excited i could barely sleep .
1	i bought this cd today and it came in . i am very impressed . it is a great cd .
1	i love tom scott and have been listening to him for year . i have also used his music to create my own musical project . his music is very unique , but beautiful and ha a new sound . he is a great artist and his music will keep you entertained for hour . i love his music and i love listening to it . when i first heard his music , i did not know what i would do with it , but i think it is great ! i have downloaded many song and have been working on my own song . i love his music . it is very relaxing and ha a new sound . it ha a unique sound and it is very fun to listen to . i am so pleased that tom scott ha created his own music and i love it ! his music is very fun to listen to , but also very relaxing . his music is very special . i have bought many of his cd and have been listening to them for year . i am very happy to recommend him to anyone who is interested in his music . it is very fun to listen to and i have been listening to his music for year . i would like to thank tom scott for all his hard work and for giving me so many great music . thank you tom scott !
1	i would recommend this album to any fan of old-timey , classic country music .
0	i really like the intro and the chorus . it is a nice listen , but it can get a little boring after a while . this song is the first one i have listened to today .
0	one of the better mike varney tribute/cover album . the song are good but the song are too long . the song about a man who could not love his wife and she would not leave him is a really good song . i could not love you and you could not leave me is a great song . this is not a bad album , it is just really short .
1	i love it when i hear a song that i like , i like it more when it is from a new artist .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this is possibly the best radio show i have ever heard .
1	i have been listening to this album since i wa a teenager . i have heard a couple of song from it but i never heard it until i heard this interview done by a great radio station . it wa with a lady who wa a songwriter . she asked the artist about the song all alone with something to say . he said that he wrote it in a church . that it wa a song that wa like a hymn . he said that it wa really personal . that the song could be about anything . that the song wa inspired by memory and thought that he had been having . that the song wa based on a real relationship .
0	i love bonnie tyler . but , i just got this cd and it is not working for me . the music is great but the lyric are just stupid .
0	great album . i love his work .
0	i bought it because i like to listen to music and i like to buy music . i like it because of the way it look and the style . i like the lyric that are on the back of the album cover . i would recommend it if you are cool .
1	this is the best song on the album . i love the lyric and the music .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i like this song . the girl singing this is very pretty .
1	this album is one of the best that i have ever purchased . it is great for the person that like to listen to music on their ipod . the music is very relaxing . a person can listen to these track for hour on end or just a couple of hour . the music is very soothing and you will find yourself sitting on the couch listening to the music with your eye closed .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i wish he had included all the other jps song .
0	i like this record . it is great ! i like it a lot . you should try it .
1	i love this cd . i can not wait to buy it . i do not know the word to any of the song on here .
1	this is a very well done song . it is great .
0	i really enjoy her voice , but i wish i could be able to hear more of the song from the album .
1	the song she is sung on the cd are great . i like her voice .
1	i like this cd , it is a really fun cd to dance to . i like the song . there are a lot of good song in the cd .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i love it . it is her best album since best of bonnie raitt .
1	this is a very good song and a very important song to barbra streisand .
1	i would listen
1	i love this album . i really like to listen to album of this type . i have also received the cd in a cracked case and the cd is cracked . the cover is beautiful . i have to have the cd in a jewel case to get the cd to stay in the packaging .
1	great sound . the whole time i wa thinking about this being a gnr cover , but it is not . this is a joke .
0	this is absolutely the worst album i have ever heard . it is like someone made a copy of the cd and then went to great length to make it sound better . the vocal sound like there is a guitar behind the singer , not in front of her , and the melody is all over the place . i tried to listen to the song in order , and some song were still on the same track , but some were just looping endlessly . i have to say , the only positive thing about this album is that it is the only album i have ever heard by this band that ha a great song .
0	i have heard this song on the radio a couple time . what i did not expect wa that it would be such a hit . this is one of the best record i have ever heard . i do not know how you can call this a ripoff . it is so real , so true and so pure . i am sure you have heard this song thousand of time .
1	this song wa amazing . i enjoyed the song very much and the video wa good too .
0	i like the way that you are singing . you are a great performer . i like the way you sing . i like the way you sing . you are a great performer . i am impressed .

0	i really liked the video . i thought the song wa really good . i thought it wa very funny and different . i thought that it made you laugh and it made you smile . i thought it wa a nice song to sing along with .
0	the first cd is a good album , not a good a the second cd , but good .
1	i am a big fan of the beatles , and have probably one of the most extensive collection of their record . when i saw this album on the cover , i knew that it wa the one . it wa a if a light bulb went off in my head and i wa immediately drawn to it . i love the beatles , and i love this album .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i love this cd . i have listened to it often . i like the song gangster very much . i think the song gangster is an excellent song that bruno mar ha ever written . i think this is the best cd of bruno mar . i think it is a good cd , but this is not the best cd . i think this is the best cd of bruno mar . i think that this is the best cd of bruno mar . i think it is a great cd , but this is not the best cd . i think this is a great cd ,
0	this song is not good .
1	barbra streissand is an incredible singer and songwriter . this is without a doubt barbras greatest song .
0	the first track in the song this song is a great song , i love this song !
0	i am not really sure about this recording because i have never heard them before . but maybe it is just me .
1	i am a huge fan of country . i love the music and the lyric . i like that it is a
0	i saw tom wait perform in tampa at the seminole hard rock cafe . i loved his music and so i went to see him . i loved the show , i had about 10 friend with me and i wa not disappointed . however , there is no tom wait . there wa a cd released in 1993 called tom wait live in tampa which wa recorded in that same concert . it is a great concert and a great album . i would like to hear more of tom wait in the future . the cd ha a great sound and is very well produced .
0	this song really is just not worth the time it take to listen . it is just a song to listen to with no other purpose . i really do not like it .
0	this song is a lot like gnr . it is catchy , but it is not great . it is not terrible , but it is not great either .
1	this is one of my favorite live album . i wa surprised by the quality of the recording .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	a great song , well recorded and performed , but the singer is a little too low in the mix . would have been better , and the whole show , if the singer wa higher in the mix .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i do not know why the song is not longer , but it sound good when it is done .
0	i wa browsing through the record store and saw this album for sale . i bought it because i did not have anything else to listen to . i listened to this album for the first 20 minute and then left it on the record player and listened for 5 minute . i will not waste my time writing a review on this album .
1	this is an amazing album . i love the song choice . i like how the album mix of old school and new school . i love the diversity of the song . i love the new school trance and love the older song . this is a good album . i really hope this album is released online so that i can buy it .
1	this is my favorite radio show .
0	this is my all time favorite song . i have seen this song many time and have really enjoyed it . it is one of my favorite song . it is very well written and well played .
1	this is by far the best hammond album i have ever heard . it is beautiful . i have never been so excited to find a hammond album .
0	i heard this song last night . i wa surprised at how much i liked it . it is a catchy song .
0	the album is decent . there are a lot of good song , but i do not like the music . the music is too loud and doe not flow like most christian music . i am not sure what the problem is . i do not think that the problem is with the cd . i think that the person who is reading the book is the problem . i think what the pastor should say is christian music is god gift to u , but we all need to be very , very careful when we listen to it .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	this is a great song . i am a huge fan of the band , and this is just one of the best song that they have ever written . i have listened to it many time , and i have never been able to pick out just one song that really stand out to me .
0	this is a good album , i think . it is not what i would consider to be his best , but it is a good album for a great musician and a great artist .
0	i am a fan of jewel . i have watched her video on youtube for year and i have read her book . i love her music . i have been a fan of her for a long time . this album is just awful . i can not believe she put this out like this . i can not believe she put this out . i will probably stop buying her album .
1	i have only heard this song once , but i love it .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this is not a song . it is a video . i think it is a good idea to have a video song for a video but even if the song is good , it doe not belong in the video . it would be better to have a separate song , since it doe not really fit in with the video anyway .
1	this is one hell of a
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this album is absolutely amazing .

1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i like this song , but i am not a fan of mileys . i am not a big fan of mileys music , but this is a good song , and i want to hear it more .
0	this is my second tape of the year . this tape is great , i love the way they sound .
1	i have been a fan of jewel for a while now . i have loved all of her album since her first , which is the the black album . it is one of my favourite . i have been a fan of her since then and have been looking forward to this new album with the hope of it being even better than the first . i am glad i got it back . i love it and i do not know how i can rate it any lower . i love her voice and the way she sings . she is got a good voice too .

1	this is the only beatles album i ever owned . i love this album and the harmony are amazing .
0	this album get a 0. it is a mess . it is not worth the money .
1	this may not be all that good , or even all that good , but it rock !
1	this is one of my favorite song !
0	i have had this cd for a few month and have listened to it over and over . it is the most atrocious song ever recorded , and it is a shame that people are willing to pay $ 20 for it . i am sorry , but it is the worst cd on the planet .
1	this is an excellent album . it is one of the best i have heard .
1	i can not wait to listen to this cd . the song are great . i like the band bette midler .
0	i would like to have a cd of this song , but i am not sure it would be the same . i am glad i am not the only person that think this . i know my ear have been accustomed to the volume . i had to turn it up to hear it . i can not say for sure if my ear have adjusted to the higher volume but i would like a cd of this song . my favorite is the way the music flow from one song to the next . i like the way the song go from country to rock and roll and back to country again . i am not sure if it is the same song because i have not listened to it in a long time . i am very sorry that i will not be able to listen to the audio of the song you sent me . i am happy that you are able to listen to the song at the same volume that i am . i would like to know when the cd of the song you sent me will be coming . when the cd of the song will be available i will let you know .
0	this is a good album . i do not know why i do not like it , it is not horrible , it is not good , but it is not bad either . i am not sure why i do not like it . it is a good album .
1	i have been listening to this song for year . the version i have heard in the radio is horrible . the version i have heard in the theater is wonderful . i think that i heard this song on a television show ( or a movie ) , but i did not know that i had heard this song until i wa reviewing this item on amazon .
1	most of karajans early recording , but it wa a single disc . this is probably the best that came out of his first album , and it is a great single disc recording in my opinion . there is a lot of variety , from more traditional music like prelude to folk-type song like lenfant and le chanteur , and there are a few of his famous song like lamour et la mer or lamour a-t-encore , and a few of his lesser known song like le dernier songe or je veux . there is even a live version of lamour et la mer with karajan and soprano emma rydin . but it is the song that really caught my ear and made me want to listen to this . i can not remember the name of the song exactly , but it is one of those song where you wish it wa in the original recording .
1	i have enjoyed listening to this song for a long time . it is a fun song . i love this song .
0	it is not really a song . it is a video . this song and video are great and cute but it is not a song . it is a video , because that is what miley is famous for , but she is not really an artist . she is just someone who is famous for being famous .
0	this is a great song . it is just a song . not a bad song . not a great song . just a song . this really is just a song . i do not even think this is a great song , but it is a great song , and it is one of my favorite song of all time .
0	i really enjoy this song . it ha good music and lyric and it is good that it ha a good beat . i would have to say that this song is not that good . the note do not make sense and the singing is really bad .
1	this is a beautiful song to relax too .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

0	this album ha some really great song . i really enjoy the sound quality of this album . the sound are really good and the lyric are good . this album is really good , but i do not think it is worth the price .
0	i like the song . the video is not something i will watch . maybe i will later , but i think i will end up playing this for my friend .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	what the hell is this cd ? it is a commercial cd . the music is all the same stuff that is in state of trance 2007 and 2008. what the hell is this cd ? the track range from good to horrible , with the average being pretty good . i do not know why i can not find one decent track on this cd , but if you are expecting a good quality cd , you will be disappointed . this cd ha been played by several people , and they all said it wa the same cd a the state of trance 2007. this is a waste of money .
0	i like the song , but the only thing i do not like about it is that the beginning is repetitive , and the other part is really short . i like the song , but i do not like the beginning and the other part .
0	i like this cd . i like the message in it .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .

1	this is one of the most beautiful song ever recorded .
0	this wa not the best album i have ever listened to . i am a big fan of the beatles , and this album really doe not appeal to me at all .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i think this album is a great whitney houston album . i have been a whitney houston fan since i first heard her on the ed sullivan show . i think this album is the best whitney houston album by far . i can listen to this album for hour !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .

0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i like the song , but the vocal is a little bit off
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard on this album .
1	i had no idea that this song wa written for a movie . i bought it because it wa played in the movie the godfather . i wa not disappointed at all . the only thing missing from the movie wa the song bewitched .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i bought this album a few year ago after hearing it on the radio . it ha helped me through a rough time that i have had .
0	i love hearing her song all the time . this is the second mariah cd i have bought , but i will be buying again for christmas .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this , but i think this is false advertising , not only because she sings like a robot , but also because there are a lot better song on the album , and i can not think of one that ha this kind of good singing .
0	i am a big fan of this album . i like it a lot . dan
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	this is not much of an album . i like the cd , but the song are not that great . i would suggest you get a pop playlist from one of the other artist who have album like this .
1	i have always been a fan of the dave clark five , from the first time i heard them while i wa in college to now . i am very surprised with the cd cover for this album . it is a great representation of the music , with a great photo . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
1	this is the first time i have really listened to a new artist and really liked them . this is just the beginning of a great career . it is great to see a singer like her in the music industry .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	not a favorite , but a well-crafted album . i have loved many band and this is one of them . it is worth a listen .
0	i think i would have loved to have met him . i saw him in concert a few year ago and he wa very good and i wa very impressed .
1	this is a great song . it is one of the best beatles song . i think that it is better than can not buy me love , but not quite a good . the song is about a girl that ha just gotten out of a relationship and she is sad , but she still want to be with her boyfriend . the guy doe not want to move to texas and he ha to be with someone else because he doe not like going to texas . this song is about how she wish to go to texas with the guy . but the guy is being selfish and he is trying to make it so that he can go to texas with her . in the song , the guy say that he ha to be with
1	this is an incredible song . i love the music .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i am a very big fan of mike varney , and i love his music . i really love this album , and i would recommend it to any one who like blue music or rock music .
1	this is a very good sounding tape . unfortunately ive been very lucky with this site so far , and i dont know if this is a good or bad sign for the future of the site . all the song are good ive been listening to everything you guy release . i dont know if this is a good or bad sign . im gon na give this tape a 1 star . i am very happy with the cd quality and the sound of it . i would have preferred a more solid sounding tape , maybe a little more treble , but thats to be expected from a tape . the only thing that is annoying is that the song the best ever always start at around the 4minute mark . i have to leave it at a 1 star rating because i have to leave the site to go to work . i will be back around 5am on the 2nd to listen to what you guy have in store for me . thanks .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	this is so good . i love the song . i have been a fan for so long
0	i think this guy should be signed to a major label . i like him , he ha a great voice .
1	i am one of those people who is not really a fan of the music released by the current pop star . i have always been a fan of pop music with a little bit of country in it . this album ha just that . it is a good mixture of both . i like it . i like the song . i think it is nice to have an album to listen to while you are driving or doing something you normally would not do while listening to pop music .
1	this band is awesome ! i have heard many of their song on the radio .
0	this is a great cd . i like the music .
1	this is a very good album . i am not a big fan of country music , but this artist certainly fit the bill . the song on this one are fun to listen to . i especially like that the guitar solo is a little different from every other song and it is a nice break from the typical country song .
1	the song is great , and the lyric are very inspiring . i will definitely buy this cd again .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	the beat is good , but the lyric are not that good . this is a great song . i like the music and the beat . it is just a great song , but it is not a good song . it is a great song , but it is not a good song . it just doesn
0	i am very disappointed that i have to rate this cd , and i really really do not recommend it . i listen to this cd when i go to bed and when i am driving , and i like it , but i do not think it is great . the song are not good , and i am not sure why i would bother to buy this cd . i would not buy it again , really .
1	this song my favorite song ! it is got a great groove , a great chorus , and a great melody . it is a good song .

1	in my opinion , jewel ha been playing around with her sound more and more since her last cd . this cd is her best yet . she doe a great job mixing it up .
0	you have to be kidding ! this is horrible ! i have not listened to this cd in forever . i will get rid of it immediately . it is just not worth the money to download . i will also be passing on this cd to my sister . i do not know what she is into , but i am not buying her music ! i give this a one star !
0	i wa hoping for a new cd , but it is the same old jewel . the song are not very good , but there are some good one , but the rest of the cd is just bland and uninspired . i have no interest in listening to more jewel .
1	this
0	i have been playing this song for the last couple hour . i like it because the melody and the lyric of the song are so romantic and so true to life . i would like to hear it performed live .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	the lyric are great . i am a fan of the dave clark 5 and enjoy listening to their music . i like the song and even have a copy of the album . robert
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i love this band , they are so unique and different . i have seen them twice and they are so fun to see live .
1	i love the new version of pistol annies . i am not a big country music aficionado . but this song fit right in . i feel like this song really speaks for itself .
1	i really like this song . i will play it when i drive . it is a very good song .
0	this is an amazing song .
1	i have been wanting to get this cd for a long time . i bought the standard edition at one of the big box music store in the atlanta area . the first few song i heard were the original version . i wa very impressed . i bought the cd because it wa available for a limited time . i have not been disappointed with this cd . i will most likely purchase the deluxe version , but i have always been a fan of r. kelly , so i have purchased everything r. kelly ha ever released .
0	i am a little skeptical of cd . i have never been a big cd fan . but i wa told that this cd wa great and one of the best of the year . i have not listened to it yet and am still waiting to hear it . i do not know why i waited so long to order it . i thought it would be so long that i really did not want to wait so long to hear it .
0	this cd is amazing , i am giving it to my brother a a birthday gift .
1	i am going to have to give this a positive rating . i love this song and the music video . the lyric are just a catchy a the song .
1	this cd is not bad . some song are a little dull , but the song really are good . the vocal are good , but the production is not the best . i thought the playing sounded like a band , but the sound quality is not that good . i am glad that i wa not disappointed with this cd . i do like tom wait , and this cd is a good way to get more of his music . thank you for this cd .
1	this song wa one of my favorite from her collection . she sings really good . i usually do not like ballad , but this one is different . i really like her voice and the song is great .
1	there are a lot of people who want to argue this album is unlistenable ( i disagree ) or just plain terrible . i want to ask them why they refuse to listen to the music they claim to loathe . this album is not unlistenable it is one of the best rock album of the 80 .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	great !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i like this album a lot . there are some really good song on it , and the production is good . the songwriting is a little uneven , and sometimes it is a little cheesy , but overall it is a good album .
1	this is another cd that i would like to give my child , but i do not know if i can . i think that this cd is for the average person and not for a choir .
0	this song is so bad i do not even know what to say . it is a song on the soundtrack to a movie , but that doe not change the fact that it is a terrible song . if you do not like it , do not listen to it .
0	oh , wanya . this is an awesome song , but it is not what i would consider a hit - it is actually not a very well-known tune . i wish it had a name , but at least i got to hear it and enjoy it .
1	i love this song . this song is very beautiful . i would like to have this song in my car radio .
0	a i am sure you know , there is a lot of variety in the music on this cd . i like that it doe not contain any of his more recent stuff . i wish i could have played it on the radio , but i am not sure if my car will be able to hold all the cd . i hope to be able to continue playing this cd on the road in the future . it would be nice if the cd were available for sale in a store .
0	it is an odd song , but it is fun . it is not very good , but it is not bad either . it just doe not do anything for me .
0	this is a great album !
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i like to have her song on my ipod .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .

1	this is a great jazz album . john coltrane , the king of jazz is an amazing artist . i really like the music .
0	this album is a real disappointment . i have never heard a band that sound so unoriginal . i would recommend this album to any fan of the genre , but not to fan of the genre . if you are a fan of this genre , you should be ashamed of yourself .
1	this is one of the best album i have heard from the last few year . the vocal on the song are amazing and the melody are amazing . there is a lot of stuff going on in this album , which is really cool .
0	this song doe not have a bad song but ha a few weak part . i would definitely recommend this song to anyone .
1	the only negative thing about this album is that there are not any great song like wan na be your lover , she is your lover , you do not have to be and the way you look tonight
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .

0	i can not listen to this album . this album is very boring . it is very repetitive and uninteresting .
1	well , here we have a nice cover of a beatles tune . what is not to like ? i bought this cd just to be able to have this song on it . that is all i really wanted .
0	i like the song if you go but i do not think i would ever listen to another song by this artist . i like the ballad better but this song should have been one of the ballad on her last album . this is not a commercial pop record . i do not know why her record company did not choose another artist to do her song . i do like the rest of the album . this is the only album i have ever bought . i have been a fan of hers since she wa on saturday night live . i bought the album in a record store that wa a little out of the way , it wa not in the main part of town . i had to drive down to the main part of town to buy it . you can not buy record in book store anymore . i have been a fan of the singer and her song since she wa on saturday night live . i have been a fan of the singer and her song since her last album came out . i have been a fan of the singer and her song since i wa in high school . i have been a fan of the singer and her song since my parent got me a stereo cassette tape player in 1986. i have been a fan of the singer and her song since they were on saturday night live . i have been a fan of the singer since they were on saturday night live . i have been a fan since i wa in high school . i have been a fan of her since she wa on saturday night live . i have been a fan since she wa on saturday night live . i have been a fan ever since she wa on saturday night live . i have been a fan for a long a i can remember . this is the only album i have bought since she wa on saturday night live . i have been a fan forever . i have been a fan for a long a i can remember this is the only album i have bought since she wa on saturday night live

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

0	i must admit that i could not take my eye off you after you came on stage after the first set . you did not disappoint .
1	this is a very good app to read to one or more child .
0	this is the version of the song that i have been enjoying on your site for the past couple of month . i have enjoyed it so much that in the last couple of week i have tried to download a number of your song , but i have been unsuccessful in downloading most of them . however , the song i am yours is available a a demo download and i have decided to try it . this song is great but the version on the demo is not a good a the version that you have on your site . what give ? i would really like to have the full version of this song . i do not get why you do not have it available . thanks for your help . bob

0	i wa going to buy this cd , but when i got it , it wa scratched . the cover wa also smashed into piece . i called customer service and they said that it wa my fault , but that they would fix it . i said that i could not afford to buy a new cd , and that i wanted to send it back . they said that i could send it back , no problem .
0	what a waste of money ! this band name is the last thing on earth i want to hear for christmas . they have a lot of talent , but they are just not very good . i would not buy this cd , and will not listen to it or give it a second chance .

1	this cd is very well done . i can listen to it all day long . i love billy joel .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i like this song . the lyric are clever . it is a good song for the summer .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	this is a cover of a song by a band i have never heard of . it ha nothing to do with the lyric and is not at all a good song .
0	i really like this cd . i do not understand why this person who ha been so brilliant with so many song in his career ha chosen this one . i am very disappointed . i will listen to it , but i do not want to listen to it . i am sure there are some good song on it , but the production is so bad , that i do not understand why someone would put this cd together .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .

0	this is a great album . the song are well-written , and the arrangement and performance are very good . this is a great addition to any music collection .
0	this album is amazing .
1	i think tom wait did a great job on this one .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this is probably one of the most important song in the history of the world . it is a song that is a part of the foundation of all humanity knowledge , and it wa a part of the foundation of my understanding of god .
0	this cd is really good with a good variety of song .

0	i do not know why i am even listening to this album . this album sound amazing , but i do not like this album . i can not imagine any of the song on this album being played on one of reo speedwagons other album .
1	i love when i drive by this house , i think about the beautiful people living there . when i sing the song i feel like i am singing for them .
0	this is a great song about standing up for your right . it is empowering for a young girl like her .
0	well , i had to give this a try to see what it is all about . i think it is all very well done and the piano and string part ( and the vocal ) sound fantastic . but when i thought about it for a while , i realized that even the song itself is kind of boring . i mean , it is fun , and a little bit different from previous version , but i would have rather listened to the original version by leonard bernstein , which wa much more impressive .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is the best mariah cd that i have heard . i am a fan of mariah since i heard her first cd . then i bought the album beautiful . i like everything that she ha done and i have bought all her album . i bought this cd because i wa looking for something new . i have always liked her music and this is my second cd that i have purchased . i buy all mariah cd for my son who is a big mariah fan . i have bought two of her cd this year . i am really happy with mariah now . now i can really say that i am a mariah fan .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	my son really liked this song . he thought the chorus wa cute .
0	i have purchased this cd twice . i love the song , but i think that the cd cover art is very generic and the layout and layout are not well done .
0	i have been listening to her song for year , but i just had to listen to this song . it is absolutely incredible .
0	i did not like this album . i expected much more . all of the song are so similar , and they all sound the same . i do not understand why people bought this album . i will probably buy the cd for my niece and nephew , but i will wait until they can hear jewel on the cd .
1	i am a newbie to the site but this is the first cd i have purchased that ha made me feel relaxed . i like to listen to my cd whenever i am down and not to listen to the same old song that i have already bought .
1	i like the dave clark five album more than most because they are the first to mix rock with country . i also like that they did a lot of rock song . i have listened to this cd over and over and i have never tire of it .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the
1	i have not been a fan of this artist . this album had a very different feel from his past album . the song are well written , and the production is very good . this album is a good album .
0	i like the movie more than the song .

1	i wa impressed with this album , although i am not very good at singing .
0	i am happy with the quality of sound on this cd . the song selection is excellent , and i am really looking forward to the next album .
1	i am not sure this is the best prince album , but it is one of my favorite album of all time .
1	i just downloaded this album and it is a great album . i think it is one of the best jon lord album i have ever heard . this is by far the best album jon lord ha released . i believe jon lord will be a great performer and singer one day and i hope he will be the next jon lord .
0	this is my fourth purchase of the jewel cd all by myself . this cd is wonderful . it ha a great message , song , and great singing . all the song are wonderful . i hope you enjoy listening to these . i do . i hope you enjoy listening to this cd .
1	a great mix of a variety of genre . i love the mix of sound that they have , and the fact that they are so diverse and different from each other is what make this album great . the band is really good at just being themselves , and not trying to fit in with any other band . this album is great , and for all those that are not familiar with them , i would suggest that you go out and download this album , and when you go to itunes , you may want to purchase this album , because you just might end up liking it .
1	i just listened to this cd on my car stereo . it is a great listen . not worth buying or listening to . the music is a little too repetitive for me . but i still enjoyed it .
0	the cd is interesting and well produced . i like this cd .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	this is a really good country song . i would say it is better than the beatles song . it is a good song .
1	i bought one of these cd for a friend . she loved it . i thought it wa a great christmas gift .
1	i liked the album . i am a sucker for good blue . i think e.s.posthumus will be one of my favorite .
1	this is a great cd . the music is very relaxing and will help you unwind . the music may not be the most interesting music available , but it is relaxing . this is great music for those that like to listen to music while they are driving .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	this is an amazing recording . it is a very fine example of what a quality recording should be .
1	this is an old favorite . i have been listening to this song for year and year , and it is always bring a smile to my face . so much that i even found an article on the internet talking about how it is one of the most played song ever on the radio .
1	the album is great . i have heard a lot of praise and worship album , but this is by far my favorite . the song are not over rated , but they are very good . i love the song heaven door . i think the worship music genre ha a new meaning . i know the lyric to most of the song are not what you would call scripture , but it doe not matter , because what is good enough for god is good enough .
0	i have got a friend who is not into the music industry . she doe enjoy the joke though . she say she think this song is great but she just doe not like it . i hope she like it .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	this album is amazing . the song are great , the vocal on the song are great , and the melody on the song are nice . the album is fun and cool .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	if you are a fan of the beatles and want to hear their best song to date , give this album a listen . it is pretty good . i think i have only heard one song that really stand out on here , but that is because i am an old school beatles fan . i know this album wa released over a decade ago , so their song have changed . but i still love this album . a few song are better than others , but all in all , i still love this album .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	the original , by the way , is not on youtube . i have searched for it for awhile , but i did not find it . i will try to find it .
1	i like this song .
1	i am sorry is a very sad song . it is about a man who is unable to love his woman . he spends his life trying to show her he love her . he miss the time they spent together and he try to make it up to her by giving her gift . he also try to make her feel good by singing to her . he doe not succeed , because she is a liar . she doe not know how to love him back . she doe not know how to love him back . she just want to be loved . she just want to be loved . she feel she should be loved , and she can not .
0	i loved this album !
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i love this album . love the song but do not love the album . not a fan of the mix , but definitely a fan of the music .
0	this is one of my all time favorite song .
0	i love this song , but i have to agree with the other reviewer . the lyric are offensive to woman , and this is a song that is supposed to be about woman .
1	the beatles were the first band i got into when i wa about 6 , and i have loved them ever since . every album is a musical treasure to me , and this one hold the most special memory . i bought the beatles collection in 1978 and it ha been a treasure ever since .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this is an awesome album . this album is one of the best album of the year . thats why i bought it for my self .
1	just bought the album , and i am pleased .
0	i love the album cover and the song but the only thing that ha bothered me is the vocal . i think that it is a little too over the top but that is just me .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i really love the song on this album . they are very good .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	i love this band , and i think that they were a big influence on my career . i discovered them a couple of year after i realized i wa gay . i discovered the dead when i wa 14 , and i am still listening to them today . some of the song on the wrecking ball are a little cheesy , but that is okay with me , i still love that stuff anyway !
1	this one a keeper !
0	i thought this album wa going to be horrible . i wa wrong . great album .
1	so glad i discovered this song . i have been getting a little tired of all the rock stuff . i really enjoy this song , but it is just not the rock that i want to hear . i think it could be the answer to all my prayer .
0	i have to disagree with this one . i like this song , so i am going to include an interesting opinion that doe not necessarily disagree with the review , but rather think that it wa just misinformed . the only reason i can think of for why such a negative review ha been placed on this song is that it is on a soundtrack that ha an overabundance of 80 music in it . i mean , this movie wa released in 2006 , so it would have to be around that time for the song to be overplayed that much . i also believe that the reviewer doe not have the correct background on the movie , so he may be misinformed . the opening scene wa filmed a few year before the film wa released , and this song wa chosen a part of the soundtrack because it wa a pop style that wa the most popular of the 80 . a for the lyric , i believe they are a little bit old-fashioned , but i also believe they are perfectly suited for the film . i will state that i have listened to this song numerous time , and i like it . i personally think the film is better anyway , so that make me think that the reviewer is just wrong .
1	i love it .
0	this is no masterpiece , but it is a great album - just listen to the guitar solo and you will have no doubt . there is a new age feeling to this album , which is refreshing and welcome . the song have a nice swing to them and you can just imagine the guitar solo . i would recommend this to anyone who like great rock and blue and can not get enough of it . if you like acoustic album you should try this .
1	i like the song . i wa very surprised at how good this one wa . i have been a fan since her first album , but i had not gotten to see her perform and have not been able to get her to come out with much . this song is a great tune . i really like the song . it is just one of the song that you can not get enough of . it is just one one of the song that you can not get enough of .
1	great , very good , very good , very good , it wa the best album i have heard in a long time , very good , very good , very good , very good , it wa the best christian album i have ever heard , very good , very good , very good , very good , very good , it is a great christmas album , very good , very good , very good , very good , very great , very good , very good , very good , very good , it is a great christmas album , it is a great christmas album , it is a great christmas album
0	this cd is nothing but a lot of annoying singer who sound like they are from a radio show . i have a lot of relaxing music on my player .
1	i love this cd . it is so much better than the original . my only complaint is that i wish it came in a better box .
0	this song is from the movie the rocky horror picture show . it is not the same song a on the movie , so you are going to have to listen to the movie version to know what i am talking about .
0	i think this is one of the best rock song ever put on cd . i wa wondering in the past if this wa a classic . i have had it on my car for the last 2 yr .
0	this wa just okay . it wa really simple and not very effective .
0	i like this song . there are some good thing about this cd : ( 1 ) it play at the same time that the radio station do ; ( 2 ) the sound quality is excellent . there are a few thing that detract from the whole : this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start again - each time it doe the same thing . the vocal are weak . the drum are fine but the bass is weak . the guitar is fine but the riff are boring . i have a song of gob that ha a similar bass sound to this one . ( 3 ) the lyric are lame and the feel of the song is not like the other one . in general , this one is a waste of money . ( 4 ) if anything , the bonus track are even worse . gob is the one with the most potential . this is a great song , but gob is the one with the most potential . ( 5 ) the bonus track are a waste of time . you could have done something better with them .
0	this album is just not worth the price . it is a waste of time .
0	i got to hear this album on cd and it is awesome .
1	this wa my first cd and i love it . i really enjoy the variety and style of music on this cd .
1	i am a huge fan of old-timey , country and western , and i do not think i have ever heard such a good old-fashioned country and western song , and i have heard many . i love this album .
0	i like the cover . i like the music . it is the only cd i have ever bought . the cd is good . i just do not like the music .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i love this album . i have a lot of barbra streisand greatest hit , and this is the first cd released since her death that i want to own . not easy to find . i listen to it in a car , on my ipod , and over the radio . the lyric are great , and so is the music . it reminded me of her early day , when you did not need to be a singer to be in show business . she is still in great shape .
1	what is up ? this is very simple . i just want to have some fun . i know it is a little different from everything else on the site . that is fine , it is just a little different , that is all . i like to listen to music while i work . i like to listen to it when i am on the computer , when i am on the bus , in the car , in the shower , whatever . i like to listen to whatever is playing in my head . i like to find a song that ha a great melody or lyric and then i like to play it over and over . i like to write down the song and then put it on the website . i like to play it over and over again . i like to listen to it while i am driving or sitting on the bus or whatever . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do something else . i like to listen to it while i am at work and then i like to listen to it in the evening after i have worked all day . i like to listen to it when i go to work . i like to listen to it in the shower . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do anything else . it is very relaxing and i do not want to go do what else . i like to listen to it while i am working . i like to listen to it when i am on the computer . i like to listen to it while i am driving . i like to listen to it while walking . it is very relaxing and i do not want to do anything else . i like to listen to it while i am working .
0	this is a very rare record , it ha the band most popular track , including their most popular chart single . if you want to hear some of the song from the album , and not have to wait for the internet to download them , then this is the one to get .
0	this song is not bad , but it is just another song .
1	i really liked this album . a lot of classic christian song . although the song are a little repetitive , they are worth it for the song alone .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	one of the greatest song ever written and i would not change it for the world . this is the best song on this list .
0	i like the song , but the beginning is repetitive and boring .
0	i heard this song in the movie , loved it .
1	i first discovered this band when i got in my car and heard it on the radio . i think it is really good .
1	i love driving by this house and all the beautiful people live there .
1	this is definitely a good song .
0	this is the first live performance of this group . the band wa probably at the time called the bitter end . this wa recorded in 1986. there are two version of the song . the first is the version i heard on the radio . the second is the version on the cd . if , like me , you are a fan of the band who play the song i will make love to you ( which is on the cd ) then you will probably like this recording . however , if you are not a fan of the band then you might not like it . it ha the same instrumentation a the i will make love to you version , but the bass player is missing . the bass is now played by mark mad dog schatz , who is the third member of this band . this is not a good recording , but it is a good version of the song . it is available for download through the music player on the itunes store .
1	this is an excellent jazz album . the band is very good and the music is very good .
1	i absolutely love this song ! it ha a great beat and just add to my list of favorite song . i would recommend this song to anyone who enjoys music .
0	i have been a fan of tom wait since his first solo album . i am not a huge fan of the man , but i am a fan of his music . i wa hoping to find a recording of his band , but it wa not to be . this album is a real gem . i have it on cd and in digital jewel box . the sound is clean , but not perfect . i would like to have a better quality sound system to listen to this album . the album ha two song that are not included in cd . the first is a song called the man in the mirror and the other is called i am a star . i do not know why they are excluded , but i do not see how anyone could enjoy this album unless they are a tom wait fan . these are the only song excluded . i give this album 4 star .
1	this cd is a mix of popular classic and obscure piece from the great american songbook . of all the cd i have purchased recently , this one is the best . the song are not only well chosen , but they are catchy . the only flaw i see on this cd is the poor sound quality . i have a cd player at home , and you can not hear the difference between this and the cd player .
1	i am a huge fan of this band and i think that all of the song on the album are great . i always appreciate an album that ha a story behind it . this album ha a story behind it . i would recommend this album to anyone who like this band .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i think my favorite band in the world is the ramones . but at the same time , i have to admit , i would like to have a new front man . i wish i could hear the song played live , like i heard them on their tour . however , if they did a new album , i would feel like they are trying to re-invent the wheel . their musical talent is second to none , but they are not innovative . i believe they are very loyal to their current song .
1	this song is a great song , but the video is terrible .
0	this cd is good . i like the dave clark 5 song they did in the 1960s .
1	i love this song .
0	i have always loved the beatles . even when they were a little rough , i loved the song they made . the album abbey road ha always been my favorite beatles album . i think it is one of the very few album that is actually better than the actual recording . i think they recorded it a a demo and went back and added more overdubs to the end of the song . i do not think they overdubbed much , though , except at the very end of revolution 1. i wa about 8 year old when the beatles first released it . i always had the beatles on the record player in my room , and when i wa little , i always had the beatles in the tv in my room . i listened to it often . i still have a beatles album from 1965 : yesterday and today , which is so much better than the actual album . the first time i ever heard abbey road , i wa listening to it with my sister . my sister said , it is too quiet . i said , well , that is because it is not . i do not know . i think the first time i ever heard a beatles recording , the song were still coming from the radio . i got them on cassette , and they were so much better than the recording .
0	i love the way this album came out . this is a great album which i think is going to blow up . so , if you love this album , and are also a fan of the blue , this is a must have .
0	this is an amazing album . the cover is beautiful , and the cd is wonderful . the only thing that is bad about this cd is that it doe not play . i will not buy this cd .
1	this cd ha helped me relax and i recommend .
0	the song wa a bonus song on the cd and the booklet i received had the title - brandy greatest hit . very odd .
1	this is all original song and great song . i would listen to this cd every day . i have only listened to this cd once , but i am very interested in purchasing more cd of hers .
0	i am not sure what the name of the song is , but it is a great song .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i just received this cd , it is incredible . i bought it a a gift , and i am so happy with it . i love it .
1	this song reminds me of my favorite song , love and lie , by peter gabriel . this is a very powerful song that i think you should not listen to without headphone .
0	this song work on a personal level . it is a simple love song that really express something . but the lyric are so cliched and boring , and the melody is just not in tune with the lyric . it is not a bad a some of the other song here , but i would not recommend this to anyone .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this is a new cd from a new group of young black musician . it is my first time hearing them . i absolutely love this cd . the music is good and the lyric are great . i like the group because they have a lot of variety and they are good musician . i am looking forward to listening to the rest of the album that they have made . i like the sound of this cd .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	this song is great . my granddaughter is a very special person . it is empowering for a young girl like her to sing about her father .
0	i enjoyed this album . the band at time reminded me of the grateful dead , especially on the last song . the album wa great . this is the first cd i have heard of this band . what a pity i have to give this album a negative review . the band wa very good , but the vocal are really not up to par . i think the vocal were recorded in a studio , not live , and the vocal are very poor . they are pretty terrible . i have been with the band for 3 year and they have never had a bad performance . i guess my only criticism is that the vocal were recorded in a studio . the vocal are pretty terrible . i think the vocal were recorded in a studio , not live . i think the vocal were recorded in a studio , not live . i think the vocal were recorded in a studio , not live .
1	this is just a great song , and it is got a great beat and a great chorus .
1	i love tom wait ! i have listened to his entire discography and this is by far my favorite . when i wa a kid i used to make fun of him and his song i am in love wa one of the few song i could tolerate .
0	this is a very good album . the music is very melodic , but it is very repetitive . it is a little bit like listening to the same cd over and over again . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good trance album .
1	this is a really fun song . i mean , it is really fun to dance to ! it ha a really good beat , and it make me want to dance too ! i really like this song ! i think it is great ! i love how it is a fun song , and i really like the beat , and i think it is a good song overall . i just wish the album had more song like this . i mean , it is a great song , but it is short . i am not mad about that , but this is the only song in the album that could be considered a complete song . it is a good song , but it is a little short .
1	this cd contains the best song the dave clark five ever recorded in their three-decade career . they were one of the most influential jazz vocal group . they blended a lot of great music and sound with their own unique talent and style . the dave clark five were one of the most important jazz vocal group to ever come out of the new york city area . they were very versatile , but they were always at their best on the ballad and love song . the dave clark five wa the original band that played the song of the decade , including several of the biggest hit of the era . this cd contains song that are part of the dave clark five entire discography . i highly recommend listening to this set to fully understand the dave clark five and the legacy of the dave clark five .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	this website is a great source for music i am sure . i have found many song i never would have found .
1	the dave clark five were great . i am so happy to have this album .
1	i love the music i have purchased from amazon.com . it is very good quality music , and i feel confident that i will be able to get it in good quality , and they will be delivered to my home . i love the variety that amazon sell , and i will continue to shop there .
1	r.kellys voice ha the ability to elevate an album to a whole new level .
1	this is a good song , but i do not think it is miley cyrus best song . i do think it is better than we can not stop . it ha a better beat , but i still do not think it is the best song .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i got the original on cd . it is not a good a i thought it would be . it is not for everyone but for me it wasnt . it is not a good a i thought it would be . it is not for everyone but for me it wasnt . i am not the type of person who like to listen to music that is not for me . i am hoping it is for someone else .
0	this guy should get signed to a big label .
0	oh , i love this song . it is so cool ! it so awesome . i never would of figured out how to play this song on my guitar and i got a new one last week so i am gon na give this a go .
0	this is good , but there are too many song on it . i like the song on it , but it is very much like a compilation of several album .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i like this song . i have downloaded the song for myself but i have never listened to it . i like it but i do not listen to it . i think the song is great but i do not really like the song . i do not like the song when i listen to it on the radio . i do not even care when i listen to it on the radio . i do like the song when i listen to it on the radio . i like it the most when i listen to it on the radio . i like this song the most .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is the best e.s . posthumus cd i have ever heard . s.r .
1	so i heard this song on the radio and i remember thinking that it seemed like a bit of a novelty but then i heard it on the radio and it wa a song that would have been a smash . i wa just happy to hear it and now i know why it been stuck in my head .
0	i will play this for my child when they are old enough to know the joy of listening to classical music , like my parent did . they will be able to appreciate the beauty of the music , which they have never heard before .
1	i love my iphone
0	i would love to have this cd , but i think it is worth le than $ 5 . it is a very nice cd , but i do not think it is worth $ 5 to me .
1	there is a lot of good music in this , it might be hard to listen to a song more than once , but it is worth it . a good album .
1	i bought a cd for my granddaughter and she loved it .
0	i hope he come back soon .
0	this is a very odd song with some catchy part and some not so catchy part . the not so catchy part are the one i like the most . the song ha a nice mood and the instrumentation is good .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	this album ha some really good song but they just seem to be filler .
1	a a fan of the band , this is my first time hearing the album . so if you have heard it , you have heard it all . this is an album that i will be adding to my collection . it is a great mix of old and new . there are some really great track on here . i love the thriller and rappin for the n-as single , but the other song are very , very good a well . this album will not be ignored , and it will be on my list of must have .
1	john frusciante and the reo speedwagon boy did it again . i wa on a plane and heard this song on the radio . i am a huge reo speedwagon fan , and this song came on the radio while i wa waiting on a connection . i wa so excited to listen to it . i immediately turned to listen to the lyric , and even more excited when i heard them . i have to give thanks to john frusciante for writing this song . i wa not a fan of his previous work , but i have to say this is the best song i have ever listened to . i love it .
0	i wa really surprised by how much i liked this song . i do not think it really did anything for me in term of being a song . it did however , help me get through the day .
1	i wa happy with my purchase . the song are very nice and i like the video .
0	great selection of grateful dead tune . the only drawback is the price . the only reason i am not giving this a five is because of the price .
1	i wa worried for a moment that i wa gon na miss out on the whole state of trance series , but i am glad i have a good excuse because i have been listening to this cd for almost a year and the music is still on my mind . i can not wait for the next set .
0	love this album ! i love the song and even though there are a few song that i do not like , it is a good album . i have listened to it over and over and over again . i especially love the song about the war and fighting for freedom and equality and the song about love , happiness and peace .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i do not have any complaint about this song .
0	i purchased this album because i found it on the amazing album i found on amazon . i am listening to it today , and it is making it almost impossible to decide if i want to continue to listen to the rest of the album . i have been listening to music on my phone since i learned to use it , and i have never heard anything like this . this is a song that you will want to listen to every day . i am only sorry that i did not discover it sooner . i will continue to listen to the rest of the album , but i will be glad to have this one to listen to once in a while .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	this is really , really pretty ! the original version is not that great . i may even buy both version !
1	this is a great performance of the 9th . it is fast and it make me miss the beethoven i knew and loved .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i love this album ! i have it on my mp3 player at all time . it is so nice to have an album that you can listen to in the car or on the bus without having to put on the mp3 player ! it is the first cd i bought when i wa new to mp3 player ! i have many other cd but i do not know what to do with them all ! thanks for this lovely album !
0	i am not a big fan of these guy . i never have liked any of their album . this album just seemed to have the few best song on it , and the rest were kinda crappy . i really liked it because it wa still on the same style a the first album .
0	i really enjoyed the music on this album . i thought this album had a lot of good stuff . it wa very enjoyable to listen to .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this is a very interesting song . the video wa very entertaining and the song is a great ear worm !
1	i wa expecting something different but this is a great song
1	i bought the cd for my wife . she love it .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i find this one of the better arrangement of the beethoven 9th . it is the opening segment from the choral prelude to the piece . there is a bit of a rubato and a few interesting change in the tempo of the choral part and there is some interesting color added in the horn .
0	i like keith . i think he is a great musician .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	the album is great . the album is great ! the album is great ! i just wish that the cd wa a bit longer . tom scott is a great jazz artist and his new cd , guitar world , is a great album . i would recommend getting some of his cd to learn more about him .
0	i would have given this a 5 star rating if it wasnt for a few thing . first , there is a lot of noise in the beginning . second ( and maybe the cause of the noise ) , the cd wa damaged in transit . i had to return it to amazon .
1	i like all your cd .
1	this is a great album . i like the album i bought it on , but i wa not disappointed . if you are a fan of the dave clark five you will love this album .
0	i have been playing this song for about an hour and a half straight . i first heard it on an album i got a a gift and i have not heard it since . i love it . i also purchased the entire album and i hope this song becomes a hit .
0	great album . not bad for a live album , but it is a little short on the song . in the end it is a great album and if you like this band then it is worth at least checking out .
0	this song is so sad , and if you do not like this , then you will just have to be happy with the letter ( this song wa awful , so now you have two song to choose from ) .
1	i
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	the song wa great but the video is just horrible .
1	i could listen to this song all day . lorde
1	this is a great cd ! i am glad i wa able to get the cd for free .
0	i like this song . it is a little heavy for me but it is a good song . it is a good song for woman to listen to . not for men . men , listen to this song . it will change your life !

1	this music is so good . i never heard the chicago symphony orchestra play like this . i have always heard that the chicago symphony orchestra is so old fashioned . i really liked this recording .
0	if you are going to download a track that is about a half hour long , then it is really not a good idea to download it . i know the song is not bad , but it is about half an hour long . if you like the song and you are not downloading a half hour long song , then you are doing something wrong .
1	it is really soothing . i would like to have more word to what i am hearing so i can truly relax .
0	i am a country music fan and love this band . i think they are pretty good .
1	i love this cd , and i love the singing , and i love the lyric , and i like the fact that it is not a christmas cd . the only reason i did not give it 5 star is that it is very hard to understand and you can just tell that it wa recorded by a couple of really dumb people . if you want to hear a christmas cd , go buy a christmas cd . if you want to hear a cd with a few song with christmas in the title , go buy a cd with a few song with christmas in the title . this aint it . if you want to hear the sound of an album where the singer sound like he is singing in church and the band sound like they are playing in a high school gym , then this is what you want . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . i recommend this cd . you know what ? go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd . go buy a christmas cd .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	loved this song so much . but too bad it seemed to be a duet between the two singer . i wish it wa just marie .

1	this song wa the first song i ever heard when i wa a kid , and it made me think that i wa a virgin at age 4. i also liked the song . i liked it because it wa about having sex when you are not really into it .
1	i
0	this song doe not deserve any negativity . the chorus is so catchy and the lyric are just a catchy . it is so good to hear a song like this that is not only very popular , but that is also so good .
0	i had to make a return trip to the amazon store , so i bought this cd in the hope that it would turn out to be a very good cd . it turn out to be just that ! it is a very good cd , but i have to say , it is not easy to find classical music of the quality that this is . the only problem with listening to it is that it take me back to a different time , but i like it and i am glad that i bought this cd . it is a great cd .
0	love the song on this album .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this is one of my favorite jazz recording . the song is also good . i do not care about the music . what i care about is the song . this is an excellent representation of james brown . i would love to hear what the band did in the 1970s , but i do not know how to find it . i would love to hear this version on a compilation . unfortunately , it is not available . it would be almost a perfect combination of james brown and bob dylan . i would like to hear this version on the compilation of bob dylan best song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i like the song . the lyric are clever .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i have always loved this song ( although i thought it went on a few minute too long ) . i have always listened to this song and i love it . but , the cd is just not playing on my device . i know it is not the cd because the cd is broken because it will play for a few second then stop .
1	i love her voice .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is the perfect song to listen to while driving , listening to music , or just to drive by the radio station . i am a big fan of this song and i really like this album . i am not sure why it made it on the album since it is a cover . i really can not stand that song . it is another cover song . but , it is a cover that is actually good . i hope this wasnt another cover song that the people at the radio station chose to cover it . i thought they did a great job . i liked it .
1	i like this song . i think it is beautiful and i think the lyric are really beautiful .
0	i have a lot of prince album , and this is one of the best he is put out in quite some time . i love the song , and the production is great . the only problem with this album is that it is just too much of every prince album that he is put out .
0	i like that i can choose to listen to the first part or the second part .
1	this is a great song ! i have never even listened to it before but i heard it on the radio and i instantly fell in love . i can not wait to listen to this song again . i am going to purchase this album for my collection , and i think it is going to be my first time purchasing it from amazon.com .
0	i have no idea what to say about this one . i do not know if i am going to like it or not . i like this genre of music , but i do not like the lyric . i do not really have any real negative thought about it . i hope i like it !
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i like this song . it is very fun and upbeat . the lyric are fun and the sound are great . i think it ha a better flow then the other song on the cd .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	barbras voice is amazing .
1	i bought this album based on the recommendation of a friend . i did not really think i would like this album . however , i wa pleasantly surprised . i still do not know why i bought it . i bought this album because it had a number of interesting track that i wanted to hear .
1	i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition in the hope that i would be able to get a good song . i like song that i can download from the internet . i downloaded this song and it wa very good .
0	jewel ha been around for a long time , and ha a lot of quality song that people like . however , this is a pop album . if you want to hear jewel best , buy her other album . i have listened to this cd and found it lacking . this is a pop album , and not a jewel album .
0	i wa introduced here by another reviewer , so i figured i would offer my own opinion . i have not been able to find a good way to describe this music , so i will just say that it is very , very , very good . i have listened to this cd twice , and i am going to buy the cd when it come out . i am not in love with any of the song , but i will keep listening to it . i enjoy the different style . i like the way they blend the music with the vocal . i wish that it wa longer , but i am not sure if that is possible . i wish that the musician would play the chord that they are supposed to play . i have heard that this is not the case , but i wish that they would play the chord that they are supposed to play .
0	this is a great cd that i would recommend to anyone who think they like jazz . mike
0	i have not heard this song before , but i find it very appealing .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i love the dave clark five . i thought they were one of the best contemporary rock group that had come along since the beatles . but , i thought this wa going to be the first cd in a series and i wa wrong . the first cd wa not the first in a series . in fact , it wa the last cd in a series . i wa very disappointed . i wa expecting a best of series . i will probably order the next one .
1	i love the whitney houston song ! i love the whitney houston ! whitney is one of the most gifted and unique singer of our time .
0	i really do not like this song . i used to like it , but now i do not . i do not even know if i like it anymore .
0	this is one of the best song this year and maybe the best of the whole season . got ta be you is a great song and i do not think it is far from the top spot .
1	this cd ha a great mix of worship song !
1	this is probably my favorite dixieland collection , but i can not say for certain . it is just too tough to find the original album .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i have been looking for a new favorite band for over a decade . i just discovered this band called the good , the sad , the angry and the loveable . they were the last great rock and roll band . i wa very impressed with the band and the music . i also like the beatles , the who , journey and others . in fact i would say that the music of all band have great value .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i like the album . the song are good .
1	this song ha a nice guitar sound and sound quality . i really enjoy it . i thought it wa very good . i am sure i will listen to it again .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	this app make learning to read fun and my son just loved it .
1	i just finished listening to this album the other day . i have been listening to it for a while now and it really is an excellent tribute to one of the greatest , if not the greatest , singer of the 50 . i am not the only person who think so though , so i think this album is worth your time and money .
0	this album ha a lot of good song on it . the music is very good . however , this is a very long album . it would have been better if the song had been shorter . this is mostly because of the length of the song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	rnbrett is a great singer but he is too good a singer and just can not sing rnbradleys song , and he is a disgrace to the industry . his song are just terrible .
1	i love this song . i am a huge fan and i still listen to it and it is still a very fun song to dance to !
1	the best song on this album
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i love the way this album play . i enjoy learning new song from this album .
0	this is a cute song . i like the lyric , but the music is pretty bad . it is a little too soft and too quiet for my taste . it is also one of the song that is only played for about 2 second . i feel like i am listening to something stuck in my head . i am sure it will be great when it come out on cd .
0	very good song ! i would say about 5 star
1	i have this recording on cd . i have been listening to the cd a lot lately . it is not my favorite recording of karajans , but it is a very good one .
0	a great album , but there is only one good song on it . the rest is not so good . a great record but not the best in the world .
0	great album . it is a good listen , and the song are interesting and well written . i disagree that it is not worth your time .
1	i love this song . i am a little bummed that it is a little over a minute long .
1	i like this cd , but i had to get an mp3 version because the cover wa so beautiful . i would still recommend it though . it is very relaxing and nice . i really like the dave clark five . this is the only cd i bought before itunes . i wa really impressed at how easy it wa to download it onto the iphone .
0	i think this is a great song .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	this is an oldie but a goodie , but i have got to admit that i do like the new stuff better . great song , i like this one a lot . i like the song . i like the song .
1	i can not believe i wasted money on a cd . i like the cover . i like the music . it is great . i just do not like the music . my only complaint is that i did not get a refund for my money .
1	this is the best of the best , in my opinion . i had to listen to all of them before i could really decide . i bought this from amazon , and i wa really impressed with the quality of the recording and the quality of the cd itself . i would recommend this to all of my friend .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	i love the music of handel messiah . i am a fan of handel . i love the music of handel messiah . i love this song . i think this is a great song . it is a wonderful song . it ha such a wonderful melody , and such a wonderful solo violin and such a wonderful violin solo that i love . i think this is a great song . it is a very beautiful song .
0	it doe not really sound like a bruno mar album .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i wa a bit disappointed in this release . it wa more of a compilation of older song and i did not like any of them , but i did not think it wa the first album with that many song . when i heard the track the new day i wa a little disappointed , but i still think it is a good album .
0	i grew up listening to the beatles , and i wa disappointed when i found out that this album wa recorded in 1964. i thought it wa from the 60 .
1	i purchased this cd because i like i am a believer by miley cyrus and i like her music . i do not know how to rate this album . it is not an album . i am a fan of miley cyrus and i will continue to be a fan .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this is a great cd , i bought it from amazon because i liked the price , the seller wa very knowledgable and had the right price i got the cd . i love this cd and i am sure it will continue to sell . i am a big fan of the classical music i have been listening to for year now . i always wanted a good cd of classical music and this is it . i highly recommend it and i will buy more . it is a very good cd . great sound , great music , great presentation . i am very impressed .
1	this is a really good album . it ha a couple of song that i like , and others that i do not . but it is a good album for people that like good music . i have been a fan of jewel for a long time , and i like her music .
0	the movie is great , but i did not like the song . i am really not a fan of the jennifer love affair song , but this one is pretty good .
1	i really enjoyed this album . most of the song i liked , but heart in motion wa not one of them . the cd wa great . i am not sure why i did not enjoy this album more . i think that this is a great album , but i think that the song is not very good . i do not know what the song is about . i do not think it is very good . i do not think it is very good . i don t think that the tom scott band is a christian band
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i think this is a very good album . i really like it . it is not that interesting .
1	this is amazing ! i love the lyric and the lyric are very meaningful . i love the sound of the song and the way you have mixed it .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i like the song , but i do not know anything about these guy , but it is fun to listen to their music .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i like when she sings this song .
1	this recording ha to be one of the best i have heard . the sound quality is superb and that is why i rate it . a.c .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	this is a really good cd . the band is great , and i am very surprised at how much i like this cd .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	this is a very good song . the lyric are fun and the sound are great . i like it a lot .
0	i love hearing this song on the radio . it is just one of those song that i love to hear . i have purchased the original version from the site . i do not know if it is the same one , but i sure love it . the lighthouse version , along with the other version i have heard , is just fine .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i love song like this . they are just really catchy and give me pleasure . i love the music and the lyric .
0	this is my first album of the reo speedwagon so i really had no idea what to expect before i picked it up . it is a great album .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i love this album . i have been a fan since he wa in the group the revolution . i bought this album after his death . it is one of my favorite album , period .
0	i like mileys voice , i like the song too , but what i do not like is the fact that miley sings about the girl boyfriend . i do not like that miley sings about her love for the person , i just want to hear it about the love of the girl . i do not like this song to be about the love story .
0	you guy are great . the music is great , and the lyric are great , too . i feel like i am missing the point of this song though . it is not really a song about me , it is about how we feel about ourselves . but it is still a great song .
0	this song wa cool , but it wa not the greatest song ever . this song is about the band first tour . they all started to play this song and they were all talking about how they just wanted to play it one more time and they wanted to play it with the band . then , they played it one more time and they had to play a new song . i just thought this wa a cool song and i liked the way the band played it . i would have liked to hear the band play it one more time . i do not think this wa the best song to make it on the first album . i like the recording . i like the lyric .
1	i like this song a lot . it is a catchy song and i like the song a lot .
1	this is an awesome album . i have all of my favorite album and this is currently one of my favorite album . i got this album a a gift a few year ago and i have listened to it so much .
1	i like some of her song . i like her song .
0	this wa the first time i ever heard this song . it is really good .
0	a very good album .
0	lareine is one of the best band in the history of electronic music . they have created a unique sound that ha been inspiring me for the past few year .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	the cd is a bit off-putting . it is a good cd with good music . it is a good cd , but not what most christian would enjoy . i am not sure why most christian would not enjoy this cd . i do not think it is a problem with the cd . it is the problem with the person who is reading it . i love listening to christian music , but i think it is probably better if the pastor doe not say the thing that are on the cd . i do not think that it is a problem with the pastor at all . it is probably a problem with how the person is reading the book . i think what the pastor should say is christian music is a gift of god , but it is always better if you listen to it with the right attitude . how do you think a person should listen to christian music ?
1	i really love this album
1	not my cup of tea , but i appreciate it for the effort and the music .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i have been listening to this song for the past 6 month and i have listened to it over 100 time already . i love this song . i love miley cyrus because she is so awesome and she is so talented . i love the song and the video . i love that it make me happy . i love this song . i love that it make me feel happy .

0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i like the song . i thought this wa going to be a more typical song . i just did not like the recording a much a i thought it should . this is a decent song but i do not think this is really the best song this band could have done .
0	this song wa played at the end of the episode the boy who cried wolf , where gob and his friend were out in the wood and gob wa going to get lost . i like this song and it wa played at the end of the episode .
1	i bought this album for my daughter , and she wa over the moon . she loved it . i have a 7 yr old daughter . she love music , and this cd is a must have . she want to play it constantly .
0	i will not be buying this cd . i do not care about the song , i do not even know what it is about , but it sound like a lot of people have already bought it . i do not need another person opinion of a song for $ 5 . i did not get a cd for my birthday last december , i did not get a cd for christmas , i did not get a cd for my birthday in august . this is the first cd i have gotten for anyone . i do not get cd for birthday , christmas , or other event . i do not have a cd for my birthday , i do not have a cd for christmas , or other event . this cd is supposed to be a gift to me for my birthday , christmas or other event , but i do not need a cd for it .
1	this song ha been a staple in my car so long , that i have given up on listening to it on cd . i can barely remember the lyric now and it make no difference . but i still listen to it on the radio . i have to because it is the best song on the radio and i have a cd of the best song on the radio . i just can not get enough of this song . it is a great reminder to me that i am not the least important person in the world and i need to remember that , every day .
0	i like love me like a rock ( mp3 file ) , with good sound quality a well . a lot of people will disagree about this one , but i think it is a good song . this song is a little different from the other song on this album , but it is not bad . if you like this song , you will like the rest of the album .
0	a very unique and entertaining concert experience .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .

1	i recently purchased this album and have been listening to it every day for the past three day . i have to say that this is a great album for the price . i love the sound of the guitar work , the drum , and there is also a very nice bass sound . the lyric are great and the song writing is very good . i also can not help but feel that he is on the right track .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

1	this is a good cd . it ha a lot of great song i like . the prince is a great musical artist . he wa a big influence on the music i wa listening to at the time . i like the fact that she used his voice and his instrument for the prince of denmark .
1	i have a number of cd by this band . i love this song . i love the clean version better . i thought the other version were pretty good too
1	tom scott style of jazz guitar play a fast a it go . this unique style ha been very influential on the jazz genre . tom scott ha a great new album with two new original and one of his classic available with the purchase of this album .

1	i have enjoyed listening to this cd . it ha a great mixture of style . the one thing i do not like is the song amen if you like gospel music and want some good worship song , this is a great cd . it ha a lot of good song .
1	i have never heard of this band before but i love them ! i think this album is very good but i think i will have to buy all of their album because i like the sound of every album .
1	the lyric are good . the song is good . there is a little bit of a problem with the song though . i am not sure if there is a problem because there is a problem or because there is a problem . i do not know what the real problem is . i like the song , and i am glad barbra is a great singer . i am glad she is a singer .
1	i like her voice . i do not listen to a lot of jazz these day , but she ha a beautiful tone and voice .
0	this is a good album . the song are good but the song were too long . the ballad are ok. the instrumentals are ok. i would give this album a rating of a- .
0	this is an excellent album . the album is very well put together in a way that make the album stand out from the rest .
0	i like my iphone
0	it is good .
0	this song is by a young man who is only a few year older than i am . i never thought i would fall in love with him . i wa so wrong . i do not know why it happened and it is the most amazing thing in the world . i love it and i do not know why it happened . i love a man that i will never have .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i love dave clark five . i have listened to this album a ton . i like the song on this cd a lot .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i am a big fan of the beatles and i have all of their song on my ipod now , but i have yet to find a song that i would have not bought this album for . i enjoy i am the walrus , strawberry field i feel fine , back in the ussr , i have got a feeling , penny lane and we all love electric light . the only beatles track i think that i can not stand is across the universe .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i have been a fan of bonnie raitt since i wa about 10 year old . i bought this album because it wa on sale . i love it .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is the first cd i have ever purchased on amazon , and i am glad i did . the song are fun and full of entertainment . i like the fact that you can download them so you do not have to waste cd . you know , when you have to buy a cd for you and a friend , you do not want to have to waste cd !
0	i loved this album . i wish that maria houghton would release a new album . i wa extremely surprised each time i listened to this album .
0	i like him , i like his music , but i am not a fan of his singing . i know he is a nice guy , but i can not stand him . every time i hear this song , i have to turn it down to listen to a good rock song . his voice hurt my ear . i do not understand why he is still on the show , he is not even that good . i do not understand why he is still on the show , i do not understand why he is still on the show , i don .
0	this recording wa purchased a a gift for a friend who wa very impressed with it .
1	i love all of his album .
0	i like the song , but i do not think they are catchy enough . i do not think they have enough lyric , and i do not think they have enough instrumentation to make them catchy . there is a lot of instrument . i mean , there is a lot of instrument . i like the band a lot , but i think this album need a lot more songwriting and performance in the song i did not like . i mean , the song were good , but i think they need more than good songwriting , and better performance . i think this is a great album , but i do not think it is good album by any mean .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i start writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song the same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to comefrom and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ug ghhh !
1	i love this song . it is a great song . i really like it . i love this song .
0	i did not like this album . it doe not belong on this website , if you want a good rock album go into your closet and go get a good rock and roll album . this album will not give you the rock and roll . i would have like to have seen the band play a little more .
1	i purchased this album on a whim after seeing it on the cover of the top album to buy . i listened to it while my husband wa out of town and it really did get me thinking and make me feel like i just lost my mind . it is a really great album , and i find r.kelly to be a very nice person .
1	i received this cd in the mail this morning and it wa the most wonderful gift i have ever gotten . i have never heard this song on the radio . so when i saw it come up on radio this morning i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . this song is amazing . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have not listened to this cd on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio when i wa going to bed i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . and this is the best cd i have ever heard .

0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i like the music in this song very much . this is my favorite song of all time . it is a good song . the lyric are really good . this is a good song . the instrumentation is very good . this is a good song . this is a very good , very nice song . this is a very good , very nice song . i like this song a lot . this is a very good , very nice song . this song is very good . this is a very good , very nice song . this singing is very good . this is a good song . i like the music in this song very much . i like this song a lot . this is a good song . this is a very good . this is a good song . this is a good song . this is a good song , very nice . this is a good song . this is a very nice song . this is a good song . this is a good , very nice song . this is a good song . this is very good . this is a good song . this is very good .
0	this song sound like it wa a cover . i do not pay attention to cover . if the artist is good , i listen to them . if not i do not .
0	this cd is a bit disappointing because i wa expecting something really special . i guess that is what happens when you are buying cd for the first time , you expect a lot and receive far le . i am not sure if this is the best cd or not , but it is certainly interesting and a little unexpected . i am glad that i bought it , because i will be buying it again .
0	i thought this song wa good , but i do not think it is very great . sometimes , it is really just not very good .

1	i like it . it sound good .
0	i love listening to this collection of gershwin music . it ha some of the most beautiful music . these recording are not only great in the sense that they are great in their own right , but they are wonderful in how they are so different in their own way .

1	i love the song forever by this artist . i think this song is great , because of the beautiful lyric and the message of the song . i also love the chorus with the word forever in it .

0	this is one of my all time favorite . i love this song and have played it for year and year .
1	i like the way the song on this cd are arranged . it is simple and very relaxing . the vocal do not get in my way and the instrumentals compliment the vocal very well . i like the way it ha a nice bluesy feel to it . if you like a bluesy feel this would be a good starting point .
1	i really liked this song . it is a nice change of pace from the other song in the collection , and it is a very nice ballad .
1	i love this cd ! my wife and i are trying to decide whether to get the other cd . we have listened to them all and they are all great . i love allan bole , and the music is so relaxing that i have been listening to it on the drive to work , and i have been listening to it right after i get home . i could not think of a better cd to listen to right after a stressful day at work . so far , allan bole is the best , and i love his music .
0	there really is no such thing a a bad cd . i guess it is just that the people who buy them do not listen to them long enough to find out . allan bole
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	love the beatles .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is my favorite song . i love to sing along to this song . i like the lyric and the instrument . this is one of my favorite song .

1	this is the best jazz tape i have ever owned . it wa my first tape , so it is still in good shape . i love it .
0	i have listened to this twice , and i am still having trouble getting into the music . there are time i can hear thing that are good , like the soloing on mermaid in love , but i am not sure about the music . there is nothing that stand out to me a a significant difference between this music and the music i listen to in my personal listening experience . it is good music ; there are some great solo on this cd , but i am not hearing any music that change my experience of the music . there are some great vocal on the cd , but it is not a rock album . i am not sure what jp is trying to accomplish with this cd - he is trying to be a musician , but it is not coming across to me .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	a masterpiece , lareine is so talented and innovative . i just love her music .
1	i love the cd . the case it broke in the mail and i am very mad about it . very good sound .

1	i purchased this in december and wa very pleased with the quality of the recording and the ease of downloading . the price wa also very reasonable .
1	i love this song ! i love it . i have been singing this song for day . i think you should buy it .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	this album is mostly commercial . the song are far too predictable . jewel tried to inject some kind of new energy into an old formula , but it just did not work .
1	i downloaded the download for my friend and family to sing it . they all love it .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	the cd is great and i am glad i bought it .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i have been very disappointed with a lot of the new release of this great song . i wa a bit excited about this new version , but this version is pretty poor . i can not find any of the song lyric . it is pretty bad .
1	it is a good enough song though . good quality .
1	i like what i hear on this cd . the case it broke in the mail and i am very mad about this . very good sound .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i just bought this cd in the hope that it would be a great listen and then i realized it wa one of the worst listening experience i have ever had . it just wasnt anything special .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have this on any device . i liked playing it christmas morning .
1	the first album from a band that i had never heard of before , this album wa incredible . the song were amazing , the voice added to the song , and the melody . the vocal on this album were awesome , i like the vocal on this album a lot .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	just another awesome prince album , i have been a prince fan for so many year , i just need a hit for this one .
0	this is one of the best jazz album i have ever listened to . this is one of the best jazz album .
1	i am not much of a music fan but i really enjoy this cd . i really like the song on this cd . i like the way the song have different lyric . the song are different . i do not think i would have enjoyed this cd any other way .
1	a great song from the 70 , this song sound like it wa recorded in a studio with lot of echo and reverb , but still sound like the song wa recorded live . it ha a very catchy chorus , but i have a feeling that it is not too original . it sound like the song wa recorded by david cassidy . enjoy .
1	i enjoyed listening to this cd . the dave clark five are a great band .
0	just bought this a few day ago and it is awesome ! very nice work . i like how you put in the lyric . very clever .

0	i do not love this song .
0	this song are all great .
0	this song ha a great chorus , but the melody is way too upbeat and the rhythm is too fast . i do not like it , but i know many who do . jewel is a very good singer and a very good performer . i just do not like the song .
0	her voice is incredible .
1	i am a big fan of de la soul . i listen to it on a repeat in my car , and once in a while while i am driving i will blast a whole album just to feel his influence . this album is full of the same kind of energy , and i love it all . the production is great , the music is great , and the lyric are great . i can not wait to get my hand on the rest of the cd , and the other three album he ha released in the past decade .
1	i have been listening to this album for a few day now and i have found it to be a very good mix of different genre . i really like that she wrote a song about being in a relationship that doe not work yet a different song about a man that did .
1	i love this song . it is one of my favorite song . i would like to hear it in the original recording .
0	i received this cd a a gift , but i can not believe it is jewel . the song are great , but the lyric are horrible . it is like she is writing a song and then throwing in something else to make it fit . i will have to re-listen to it again to see if i can hear the lyric . i have heard the song before , but not many .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .

1	when i got to the end , i realized that there were five more song . i have all the cd . i would like to have heard this one . i really liked it . i will listen to the other three song before i buy the other cd .
0	she ha an excellent voice .
0	the first song on this album is definitely worth the listening time . the second song is a dud .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i really enjoy listening to this album , and i think it is an excellent album . the only downside is that some of the track might get repetitive to some people , but the album is nonetheless enjoyable .
1	this is a pretty good cover of the song . i would give it a 6 if i were you . it is a pretty good cover of the song . it wa fun to listen to and i enjoyed listening to it . i do not have an opinion on the original song , and do not really consider this a cover .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i like the song i am alive .
1	i listened to this first album when i wa younger and it still hold up very well . it is a decent mix of rock and folk , with a strong emphasis on the rock song . i do not really have much to say about this album , except that it is probably my favorite live album . it make a great live cd .
1	this is a very good cd . i have been listening to the band for quite a while . they are very talented and have very good music . i got the cd for my husband and he loved it . i am happy with my purchase .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i have been looking for this cd for year , i love the music and i used to hear it almost every day on the radio . i am not sure what the problem is , but i think it may be my cd player . i am going to try a different cd , also i have tried to change the cd player and still can not get the sound i want . i am not sure what the problem is , but i am going to try a different cd , also i have tried to switch the cd player and still can not get the sound i want .

0	this is a new tune , like the one on the previous track , which i am not going to listen to . i do not like the fact that there is no melody . this one just a melody without any melody . there is no chord progression , nor doe it have any , period . the chord progression are all wrong and it is a mess .
1	i wa going to write this review , but , i heard this
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i can say that i have listened to this album several time , and when it is good it is really good . i love all of the song on this album , they are just a little bit average . i have listened to the entire album numerous time , and every time i listen to this album i expect a masterpiece . but every time it disappoints me . i think that the music is great , but somehow it doe not work for me . i feel that the music should be more dynamic , there should be more variety , but in the end it just doe not work for me . i would recommend this to others , but i would avoid this album if you are expecting a masterpiece .
1	i love to sing this song . i love the lyric and the music . i would recommend this song to anyone who need a song to help them go to god .
0	if you are looking for a solid collection of rock music , this is for you . the selection are good but you will not find anything that is absolutely amazing .
1	this cd is a really fun listen . i love the song on it . the song are just great . everything is very good .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i like this band . i did not have much of a problem with the album . it wa a very nice change of pace for me .
0	i really like this song . it is a great song . i wish you had more of these song . i think they are great .
1	i would like to think that the song wa written specifically for streisand . the tune is catchy , and the lyric make it hard to stay away .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this is the best song on the album . it is a classic .
1	this is a great song . it really is , and it is just so sad . it is just so sad , but it is also so beautiful . this is a great song .

1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	there are a few tom wait song that are very good , but this is not one of them . this is a simple song , and the lyric are not very good . i would have been better off listening to the other tom waits/becky song .
0	this album is very good . she ha a good voice .
0	i received the album today & i have to say . i am not impressed . i have a hard time understanding why i would enjoy this album . the song are nice , and the vocal are ok. i do not know how anyone could like this album . it is disappointing . i have been listening to this album since my birthday . i am guessing this is the 2nd album i have listened to in the past few week . i hope that this is not the 2nd album i have listened to this past year . i am not looking to get rid of the album , but i have to say . i am not impressed . i really do not like the album .

1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i do not think the band knew this wa a live recording , so it is actually one of their better recording .
0	this is a good version of the song . kind of a good happenstance version .
1	this is the first cd i have ever bought from amazon . it is been over 20 year since i have purchased anything from them . i have a little over 2000 cd and over 300 book . this is the first cd i ever bought from amazon . i wa not impressed .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	is there anything better than listening in the car on a long drive ? this song is great . it is just a really great song . i am not really a fan of the lyric , but i love the overall message of the song . i would have loved to have seen this version of the song featured in the movie the lion king back in the 90 , but i guess that is just not gon na happen . i will just have to listen to the same song over and over on the radio . ah , well , at least it is a great song .
1	one of my favorite album . even though the guitar is a little weak and the vocal are not a good a the first one , it is still fun to listen to . i have never liked the hammonds but i love this album . one of the better hammond album .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	this album is a great album , but it is not worth the money . i wish that someone would make a tape of a young group singing song from the album .
1	i thought this cd wa really good . it wa a great introduction to the artist . i have had it for a while and i have not been disappointed . this cd is worth the money . there are many artist that do not have the opportunity to get a chance to play for u but this is one of them . i would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of jazz . this cd is worth it .

0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i really like this album . i thought it wa better than her previous album . she still ha the same voice , just more emotion than before . this is my first album with kelly clarkson .
1	this is a song written by a very talented lyricist . this is a beautiful song . i am very glad that i heard this song . i believe this song is one of the best love song of all time . it will be very hard to sing this song in front of a room full of people . it is a very difficult song to sing .

0	i have always liked the guitar work and the vocal but i am not that impressed with the rest of the song on this cd . the song dance ( lovin you ) is one that never made it onto any of the cd i have bought . the other song i do not see myself listening to again . the song candyland is annoying but i do not think it would be a big deal if i did not like it .

1	i know that this ha been reviewed several time before ( including in the thread linked above ) , but i have to tell you that this is one of the best performance by an orchestra i have ever heard . it is not only the musicianship , but the mix of instrument and the dynamic is incredible .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	this is a very good cd .
0	i had a few idea for a song that would be perfect for the site . i tried one in 5 minute and wa happy with the end result . it wa a hit . i now have a song that i will play regularly . the other song are much better though . no complaint . i have a few idea for song to make the site even more awesome . i will probably do them a i go .
1	this album is an excellent example of what a good recording should be . you should get a copy , it is fantastic .

1	the beatles are my favorite band . when i first heard the beatles in 1977 , i wa instantly enthralled . i still have all of their album , and i am still a fan .
0	the most important thing is to have fun , but that is pretty difficult when you are driving down to the beach in your car and everything is going to plan and then someone get hit by a car and you have to have a funeral that last for 12 hour .
0	i do not like this cd at all . the song i enjoy are not played and all of the song i like are repeated .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

0	i really like this music . i have listened to the whole cd and it is awesome . i love the blue . this is my favorite cd , but i did not know that they had a new cd out . i will have to wait and see if it is worth the money . i like the way they blended the music with the vocal . i do not like the music much like other blue artist . it is just a little too much to me . i do think that this cd is better than most blue artist . i like it because it is not very long and all the song are good . i like the way they blended the music with the vocal .

0	this is a classic compilation of music . it is not a classic collection , but it is a good collection of music to have on vinyl . i can listen to this all day , but i can not listen to all of it at once . the set is good , but not great , but i am not sure how to describe it any differently . it is a classic compilation of music from the 20th century . the sound is very good . the set is good for any classical music fan .
1	this album is a great song ! the song is the best song on the album . i really enjoyed this album .
0	i am a sucker for classic album ( i like the beatles , the rolling stone , etc . ) but this is not one of them . the sound quality is excellent ( though they are on vinyl ) . it come with a slipcase and i am glad that it is not bubble wrap . if you are a beatles fan , this is a great collection .

0	she make song like this . i like the video .
0	i have had a lot of trouble with my laptop and i am having more trouble with it now . i am not very good with computer , but this is my first attempt at a music cd . i have tried almost all cd , but i want to say that i really like this cd ! the music is good , and the lyric are good . i do like the cd , but i wish the song were a little louder , the music is pretty loud . if it is louder i would like it more . i bought this cd expecting to hear some good rap , but it is not it . the song are very good and the lyric are good . i would recommend this cd to everyone , but i think it is too noisy for the type of music i am listening to . i am sure i will be able to figure out a way to listen to this if someone can help me . so far i have only been able to listen to the cd through my cell phone .

1	i have just begun listening to this album , and already i can see that it is not a jewel album . it is so much more than the average jewel album . it is a collection of song . the vocal , the musical arrangement , the guitar playing , and the lyric are all excellent . but this is not a jewel album . this is not a jewel album . it is a collection of song . i like the song . i like the music . i love the music . i love the song . but i do not love this album a much a i have loved other jewel album . when i first listened to this album , there wa no other jewel album i could compare it to . i wa very disappointed with this disc , and i have not been disappointed with the other jewel album . therefore , i suggest this disc be passed on to your local record store and you purchase the other jewel album that are not a good a this . i hope this disc becomes available on itunes , but for the time being , i hope you do not buy any jewel album .

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i have listened to the cd twice . the song that is on the cd is the same song on the cd that wa already on the cd booklet . i would not recommend this cd .
0	i love the intro to this song and the title . the song is a really nice version of an old song that i am not familiar with .

1	dave clark five is one of my favorite .

0	i bought this cd for my daughter . i really liked it . she said it wa good . i like it . i would recommend it to my friend .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is one of my favorite song on this album . i love the lyric . it make me think of when i wa a little girl
1	this set of cd is a must have for anyone who enjoys classical music . the track are perfect .

1	this song reminds me of the movie the color purple . the movie ha a very similar melody and the lyric are similar too .
1	i first heard this album when my husband had it on a cassette in the car . our youngest wa a little too young to be able to handle it , so i thought i would give it a shot . i wa hooked . i loved the song . i can not even remember how old i wa when i listened to this album for the first time . i started listening to the album on my own and i always find myself coming back to it . it is just one of those album that ha a different meaning for everyone .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	one of the greatest song ever .
0	when i first heard this album , i wa blown away . the first track wa the one , which wa a song that sounded like a power ballad . however , it wa a power ballad that had a great melody . i loved the vocal on this song too . this album is fantastic .
0	a very good song , but one of my favorite tom wait song . tom wait ha never sounded better , and this is a good place to start . this is a good song , but it is not my favorite tom wait song . i do like this song , but i am not sure if i will buy the rest of his album .
0	this is off the new album , but is a live recording of the album . this is off the new album , and it is a live recording of the album . it is not the exact same recording , but wa from the same tour a the new album .
0	not bad .
1	i did some searching , but had no luck finding a recording for this piece . one wa on a cd by the boston symphony orchestra . it is a good sounding recording , but it doe not have the feel of the original recording by the composer . but i did find a recording by the london symphony orchestra .
0	i like this album , but it is a little disappointing . it is not bad , but it is not that good either . the main problem is that i do not like the vocal .
0	i like the song it is over from this album . i like the song she can not tell me anything and i am mine . i like how the album is divided into three part .
0	she is a very talented singer .
0	i used to like this , i do not really like it , it is just one of those song that i have to listen to .
1	i really really love the cd .
0	i did not think that this album wa very good . i thought the song were average and did not have any good song . i can see what is going on and i got you were not good song and the album a a whole wa not worth the money .
0	i bought this for my niece and nephew , age 8 and 6 - they loved it , it wa fun to play this through the stereo . i guess i liked it better than the music i have played them . i think i will stick with the music . there are a few part that i could have cut out , but i am not sure what it is i am missing . i guess i could have put a little more punch in the first verse , but what do i know ? i am sure it is just a simple error on my part . i think they enjoyed it just fine , they liked the music . the only thing i would have done differently would have used a brighter screen on my computer .
0	this is a song of beauty and heartbreak . there are no word to describe how i feel when i listened to it . it is the perfect song for a rainy night .

0	i love this cd , but i wish there were more song .
1	this album is great . i really like her voice and her album .
0	this song is the best thing on the entire album . it is a very good song , and it is only on the cd . and it is by david lee roth . but they took a great song and ruined it by putting the real lyric on the cd . when you put the real lyric on the cd , it just seems like they are trying to be funny . it is just the wrong lyric . and that is why i give this album a 2 star rating .
0	i just wish the vocal were better .
1	this is not a rock song . sam sparro is a great singer . this is a great , fun song . i love it . i have been listening to this for a while , and i have never heard it on the radio . it is great . i love it .
1	i am not a fan of the hurt singer , but i am not going to get into too much detail here . i just wanted to say the song is a blast . it is an easy listen , with powerful , yet simple , lyric . it is like a bluesy version of the song piece of mind with a heavier attitude . the song is played by an excellent band , including a very underrated guitarist , and i highly recommend it to anyone with a taste for the classic rock of the 60 .
1	i bought this cd for my two daughter and they loved it . they both love listening to music . this cd is a must have for their music library .
0	this is a very nice album . i wa happy with the quality of the disc . very pleasant !

1	this song is awesome . it is fun and catchy . i would buy the album . thank you .

1	i like the first song , but i can not really understand the hate for it .
1	i like the song .
1	this cd brings to light a great deal of life and a great deal of humor . the song are great . the song are a good mix of all genre . it is a good cd to listen to with others .
0	i love it when i hear a song that is so bad , it make me want to listen to it again and again .
0	when i saw this song on a web site , i thought it wa a great song . i had to hear it in person to find out that it is a bit dry . i am sorry , but that is just the way the song is . it just did not make me want to dance the way it should be .
0	keiths guitar playing is very good - not great , just good . it is nothing in my opinion he could not have done a little better , like on his recent album finger sight which i found very impressive . i like keith side , but i do not think he really is a great guitarist .
0	i like all of the song on this album , but heart in motion is an example of an album that seems to be released with no effort on the part of the artist . i guess the same thing could be said for the entire album , but i will say this , there are song recorded that were not on the album . i do not know what the criterion for the song were that were cut from this album . they are not on the cd , and i can not find where they were on the internet . i would have liked to have been able to hear them before i bought the album .
1	love this song . it is one of my favs , and a song i will never forget . i love the video too , it is hot and sexy !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	this is the best tom wait cd i have ever heard . this is soooo great it is no wonder he is so popular . i love this cd . i love his music . i like his lyric .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	this is the second time i have heard this song , and i liked it . it is pretty good , though i do not think the lyric are that great . however , it wa worth a listen . i will give it a 3 star rating though .

1	i love this record . it is great ! i think it is the best thing i have heard so far .
0	r.kelly is a great musician . i find myself listening to his music more and more . he ha a very unique sound . i would recommend this cd to everyone !

0	i have been a fan of the beatles for a long a i can remember . the white album and i want to hold your hand were both a big plus for me . i recently purchased the come together cd which is one of the great album . this album is great and it wa produced by an artist/producer that i have come to respect and admire . i feel that this album , along with the beatles white album , are the two best rock and roll album in my collection .
0	i can not describe the feeling i get from walking past this store . it just feel so much better than any other store . i love the fact that you can buy your own cassette !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i think this album is great
1	i really like this cd and i would not give it a bad review , i like the song and the music on this cd .
0	it is an interesting radio show .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i love the song .
0	i do not like this album . the song are not a good a the last album .
1	this is an amazing album . the song are great and at the same time very different . one song is really good and another song is really bad . i think this album deserves a positive review , even though it is so different from anything i have ever heard before . it is a hard album to describe but it is amazing .
1	this is the third greatest prince album , i would love to hear more from him , i bought this when it came out .
1	the review are pretty mixed up to this point , but this cd is a real winner . the track all have a real , natural feeling that is missing from most modern pop-rock . the lyric are mostly straightforward and have the ring of honesty and emotion . this is one track that can be recommended to just about anyone .
1	this album is very good . i enjoyed it .
0	i would recommend this cd . i would recommend it to my friend . i would recommend this album .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	this is a great feeling good song . i love it . i have listened to this song so many time i lost count of how many time this song ha been played . i love how happy this song make me .
1	i really liked this cd . a lot of the song were good and really had great vocal .
1	this is my favorite album of all time . the only album i have ever owned that i can not stop listening to . the song , the lyric , everything , is so rich that it is hard to pick which song to play . i love the album .
1	this is the best cd i have ever owned . it ha some of my very favorite song , and i love listening to it in the car and even when i am walking in the grocery store and have to be quiet .
0	no , it is not the same tune . it is a different tune . and , it is not about the song . it is about the song - it is about the life of an artist who sings about their life .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to be refunded ! ugghh !
1	i love this song ! it is a great start to the movie .
0	i am not sure it is a good song . it ha a good groove and the chorus is catchy . but it is not a great song . it is just over the top and i do not think that it is very catchy or good in any way . so i give this a 2 star rating .
1	a nice clean version .
1	this cd sound great ! i bought it a a gift for my son and he loved it ! i bought it a a gift for my daughter and she loved it ! i bought it a a gift for my husband and he loved it ! i purchased it a a gift for my husband and he loved it ! this cd is a great gift for the holiday season . - you are the best thing i have ever done . - thank you for the life you gave me . - you are the best thing i have ever done
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is the best and most professional trance i have ever heard . the vocal are amazing . this album is what trance should sound like . very nice , very original and very well produced .
1	i thought this album wa great but i must admit that the lyric and the band music are a bit repetitive . i had a hard time getting into this album . i would rather this band go on a hiatus or disappear . i do not like the sound of lorde and i do not like her music . i have been told that lorde ha had a very hard life . i believe this . i think she is pretty good though . she ha a voice and she know how to use her voice . i do not have a problem with her music . i just feel that is all she is . a far a the album go , i thought it wa all great . the band ha a lot of talent and i am glad we have them . i hope they continue to play because they are great . they are one of my favorite band . i will always have them in my collection . they are a band that i can listen to and enjoy for hour and hour .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	brandy voice sound a lot different than she did when she wa on the stage and singing with the grateful dead . she sound too smooth and sound like she is singing at a club with a band . this is a great song , but i do not like the way it is sung - i do not like the way she sings - i do not like the music she play . if she would sing the same way in a live concert with the grateful dead - i would be thrilled . i am not thrilled with the way the music play on my computer . i do not like the way it play on my portable hard drive - i do not like the way it play on my external hard drive - i do not like the way it play on my usb flash drive - i do not like the way it play on my internal hard drive - i do not like the way it play on an external hard drive i have not heard the song on a different computer - i have not heard it on a computer that ha win xp - i have not heard it on a computer that ha window vista . i do not like the way it play on a different computer with win xp - i do not like the way it play on a different computer with window vista . i do not like the way it play on my portable hard
0	this wa a good album , but the song did not have a lot of meaning and the lyric were not very clever .
0	not bad .
1	i downloaded this song for my daughter , and i wa surprised at how great it wa . the song is about how he and his mom were going through a rough time when he wa in high school . i think that is the only reason i downloaded it . i like the song very much . i am surprised it is not on the top of my list .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this album come on strong like a big strong woman , but it is filled with so many great song . this album come on strong like a big strong woman , but it is full of so many great song .
0	i listen to this song and think of the lyric , but i do not know how the big man got in his head . i believe that is a reference to the big man theme song , in case anyone is curious .
1	this is a very good song and a very good album .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i am disappointed in the product . i wa very excited to receive the cd and have been looking forward to playing it in my car . i am disappointed that the cd i received is no where near the quality of the music that is on the cd . the song on the cd are very boring and sound the same . i am looking forward to getting the cd again next year when i order it from amazon since they will not offer a refund . in addition , i wa told that the cd , which cost me over $ 100 , is in a cracked case . they have offered no help in getting this problem fixed and will not offer a refund . i hope that if they do not get the problem fixed that they will refund all the money i paid on the cd because i wa excited to receive it .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	this is a very good album and very good collection . the only complaint is i wish the song were longer .
1	this song is a little more slow than the previous two , and it ha a real mellow sound to it . i have not been able to find the lyric to this song on the internet yet , but i assume they are in the same vein a the other two : slow , mellow , and perfect for a slow day .
0	i am really not a fan of her music in the first place . i like her voice , but i do not love her music . her music is very similar to the music of other artist such a joss stone and lyle lovett . i would rather listen to the musician who have been influenced by the artist she is been influenced by . i do like joss stone music , but it is not jewel . and lyle lovetts music is not jewel either , so it is a little unfair to compare them .
1	this album wa so amazing ! it is so great , and it is so good that all the song are like song . i wa in tear at the end of the album , and i could not stop listening , i just kept listening until a couple of hour after i put it in the cd player ( it is only 10 song ) and i still can not stop listening . if you need a good , peaceful , and peaceful album , this is the one .
1	i wa a great fan of barbra streisand and this album just came out now and i wa so excited . i wa so excited that i bought it immediately when it wa out . i wa so excited because it wa one of the first album that i purchased that did not include a big expensive cover . i also just love barbra streisand . i do not know why she is so popular , but she wa and still is .
0	i just bought this song and have been listening to it every day . it is very beautiful .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to buy a new cd and they offered it a a freebie . i will probably buy another cd by this artist in the future . i will be buying the new one . this cd sound really cool with fun lyric , but , it is not for me .
0	this song is one of the highlight of the album , but i do not really like it . it is catchy , but it doe not grab you like the other song .
1	i really like the cd and it make me happy .

1	this is a very good album , but unfortunately i have never gotten the chance to hear it in it entirety .
0	the song are ok .
1	if you are looking for a good live band , look no further . with a great sense of humor and a great set of instrument , this is a band that put on a great show and ha a very good time . the only disappointment is that the music need to be played more often . i have been a fan of the band for year and i would love to see them get more exposure .

0	this song make me cry . it tear me up and make me feel so loved . i wish i could have this song in my life .
0	very weak recording . the band is not a very good live band , the sound appears very murky , and there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too light to make it sound great .
0	i can say that i have never heard anything like this album . this is not a good album . there is nothing good on this album .

1	i bought a copy of this a year ago when i bought the cd version of lucky to be alive because the cd wa the only one that came with a bonus disc called grateful dead bootleg which included music from the dead show with the dead . well , the dead bootleg wa fantastic . i just bought a copy of the dead show and i must say , the show from this night is the best of the dead from this night . it is a beautiful show and i am hoping that the dead bootleg may be released a an album . the dead bootleg is a wonderful collection of music from the dead .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this song is wonderful . it is a lot better than the other song .

1	this song ha a wonderful message . this is for the people who will tell you i can not do anything and that you will never be successful . this is for the girl who just want to follow her dream and be happy .
1	i bought this album from a friend and he just asked me to buy the other 2 album , but i could not find them , so i bought them from the internet and it came to $ 39.00 for the 8 cd , so i bought them . this cd is a nice way to spend a few buck . i do not usually buy album to listen to , but i really enjoy this cd . the music is great and i like the fact that the song are all the same , but the sound quality is very good . i am enjoying this cd . i am getting my friend to buy all the album .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .

1	john frusciante wrote this great song about how he is a true fan of reo speedwagon . of course , he is referring to the lyric and music of this song . ( it is really hard for me to find lyric for most of my song , and i am pretty sure those lyric are on here somewhere ) . this song is a good reminder that we can never lose that inner fan that we are . it is an important lesson that everyone should take time to listen to .

0	this album is bad ! i bought this cd and listened to it and then went out and bought a cheap cassette tape from a pawn shop for $ 5 . i listened to this album for the first 20 minute and then put it on and listened to it for 5 minute . i am not going to waste my time writing a review on this album . it is bad ! i would not buy it again or listen to it ever again . it is not worth the $ 14.95 that i paid for it .

0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i love this song . but i could not stand the video .
1	i like the album very much .
0	this song ha become my favorite miley song . it is got a great melody and a chorus that ha always been my favorite of mileys song .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i found this on a youtube video channel . it is a very good trance track , but this is not the same a the original . the original is much more melodic and is more appropriate for trance . this new song is very similar , but still is not the same a the original .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i love the song i need a hug and the song i need a little help also .
0	this is a christmas cd for my niece . i wa expecting a christmas cd with song from the christmas album . this cd is great . however , the sound quality is so poor that it is driving me nut and making me want to purchase it again . the cd is $ 14.95 . i will not be purchasing another cd from them . i would not buy this cd again . i am very disappointed with the cd . i have bought many cd from them . i will not be purchasing any more cd from them .
0	i have tried many song by this artist , but this one is my favorite . i wish i had more time to listen to the album .
0	this is good . the lyric are very good .
1	although this is a compilation album , it is an excellent listen . the first track , lovesick , had been on the radio a time or two , but i did not realize it until i wa listening to it on this compilation album . it is a great track , and the compilation album is a good one , too .
0	i wa in the middle of reading the lyric and wa going to return it , when my sister-in-law suggested i give it to my daughter , who is not a huge fan of country music .
1	this is a terrific piece of music . it is the first one i have ever bought and it is a wonderful collection . it is on the same album that the first two part of the star war episode i-iii are on . this is one of the best part of the song that it ha a great message behind it .
0	wow . i have been listening to this song for a long time and it wa always my favorite . the lyric are great and the melody and harmony are great . i like the song and the music , but i hate this version of the song . the version of the song on the cd is the same a the old one and not the new one i have heard . the song is amazing but i do not like the version they have used . i have been listening to this song for a long time and i have not heard the new version . it is just not the same song . i wish they would at least use the new version .
0	i love this band . their music is great .
0	i wa a massive eye fan when i wa in high school , and i wa disappointed when i first heard this album . so i got the old lp and enjoyed it . a i got older , i saw the movie and the album and wa blown away . it ha a great rhythm section , great arrangement , and is a great soundtrack for a live performance .
0	this is one of the best song ever written in the history of pop music . i love it .
0	this is better than the original , but not by much . the movie is better .
0	i love this recording . i know many people will hate it , but i think it is the best of the lot .
0	i love cyrus . i know i can not get this cd . it just doe not work for me .
0	this is now my favorite song .
0	1 ) it is a little hard to understand what you are looking for . if you are looking for a collection of song with a good tempo , then my heart belongs to you , you do not know me and the first time are all good choice . 2 ) i would be surprised if you are looking for a collection of song that you have heard before . a lot of the song on this album are brand new , and i am sure you can find them on other song . 3 ) the album ha one song that is new , and three song that have been played on the radio , and another song that ha been used in ad . you are more likely to find a song on one of those that you like . 4 ) the song my heart belongs to you is a new song . the song you do not know me is an original song , that ha never been released on a cd before . you are more likely to find a new original song on a cd that is released in a year or so . 5 ) the song are not sequenced in a way that make sense . the song you do not know me is sung in the key of a , then the song the first time is sung in the key of c , then the song my heart belongs to you is sung in the key of b . 6 ) the album ha a lot of song that are written in the key of b , then the song that are written in the key of a , then the song that are written in the key of c. 7 ) i do not find the song to be very interesting . i think the song are average , but nothing special .
1	this is another jewel album . i like this album .
0	i liked this song . it is not quite a annoying .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i like this album a lot . it is got some good track and some really good mix .
0	the music for the video is a little more interesting than the song . the video of the band performing these song is entertaining and somewhat interesting . however , i found the accompanying music to be a little too generic and boring for my taste . the song good feeling from the album is the best song on the album . the song all i really need is decent , but not especially great . the other song on that album are also good , but not great . i really do not know what to make of this album . i am not really a fan of this type of music .
0	the song are great . they are all fast and fun . i like the music in this set , but i wish there were some song from each of the ten album . some of these song are very good , but some are very forgettable . so i can not really say i like this set .
0	a little le rock and roll with a little more pop and rock . and at the end , stairway to heaven , just about the only song that make me want to dance . but the rest of the album is quite good a usual .
1	i am a long time fan of the car . i wa first introduced to the band by my friend that started the band with me . i have seen them two or three time , and i have seen every one of their album . i wa hoping to get the new album , and i got it today . i have to say that i love the album , and i love most of their song . i do think that the album is a little bit short , but i do like a little bit of everything . the album is called love her madly- i am not sure if i am supposed to like that , but i do . i also like the lead singer , who is really cute . i just want to say that i am a huge fan of the car .
1	this song ha been a constant in my life since i wa a child . this song ha always been a powerful music to listen to and it is a great song to sing at wedding .
1	this song is great . i love the video . the song is just a little boring .
1	i had never heard ohearns music before this album came out . i have heard his song on the radio , but i have never heard any of his own music . i found this album to be very enjoyable . i like the instrumentation a well a the lyric . i also like the fact that there are a lot of different instrument used . i also like the fact that he play a few different instrument . i also liked the fact that he ha made a couple of different version of what you see in me . it wa interesting to hear the different version . i do not know if you have to listen to all of his album to understand this album or if you just have to listen to the first couple . it is a very good album .
1	this is the best country song i have ever heard .
1	i love the music and the songwriting . i love the way she writes and sings .
1	i love the song . it is a party song , but i am not a fan of the lyric .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	one of the great album from the 90 . it wa my first real rock album . it had a great feel to it . the sound and feel wa the best of the 90 . it had a lot of great song that were well arranged . i love the music , but i think the production is a bit weird . it is good , but it is weird . it is just not the most memorable album in my opinion .
1	i really like this cd and i would not give it a bad review . i like the song on the cd . it is a good cd with good song .
1	i bought one of these for my husband and i. we are so pleased with that one . it is a great cd player . my only complaint is that it cost too much .

0	this is one of my favorite album . i have listened to it a long time now and really enjoy it . it is a great recording . i like the beatles , johnny cash , and willie nelson .
0	lyric are pretty . they are not outstanding . i love the way she sings . i have learned this from her . but , i do not feel that she is singing very well . she sound like she is singing a musical phrase out of the key , but there is no emotion behind it . i am not sure if i am giving this album too much credit . it is hard to do this with the song that are featured .

1	the beatles were my first love , and the only beatles disc i own . i have been a fan for over 30 year and am just a enthralled with the boy a i wa in my early teen , when i first came to england . i love them for their music , for their song , and for their personality . when i hear their music , i am transported to a world that had nothing to do with the music i grew up with .
0	i like the sound , i like the bell and the drum , it is a very nice little composition . it is very upbeat and just fun to listen to .
0	i have purchased this cd . the song are good . the recording is good . but the cd is just not that good . it is not the quality of the cd that is the problem , but the quality of the recording .

1	i have listened to this album over and over , and continue to listen to it . i find that i can listen to her with the same pleasure that i hear her sing on her album . i have listened to her with a little more knowledge and i can understand her lyric better . i am not the only one who find this cd interesting . i have had discussion with many of her fan about this album and it is a real pleasure to listen to . i hope she continues to make these album . i love listening to jazz . i would like to see her make a film . i would like to see her perform a song from this album on our local television station . i would like to see her perform at our local radio station . i hope she make more film . i hope she continues to release more cd . i hope she continues to make more music . i hope she will continue to write and release more cd . i hope she writes more book . i hope she writes her autobiography . i hope she writes more book and release them . i hope she make more film . i hope she performs in film . i hope she make more movie . i hope she make more movie . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she put more painting on the wall of her home . i hope she put more painting on the wall of her home and on her wall . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she paint more picture . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe painting . i hope she doe painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she make more painting . i hope she make painting . i hope she doe more painting . i hope she creates more painting . i hope she creates more painting . i hope her painting will be seen by many people . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her home . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her house . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her apartment . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her bedroom . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her living room . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of her study . i hope she will have many painting on the wall of

1	fat waller is one of the most influential jazz artist of the 20th century and , like many other great jazz artist , he only recorded a handful of album at this time . this collection is an effort by universal to bring these recording to the mass . there are many different genre that waller covered , so this collection can be used to fill gap in any collection .

0	i do not think it wa a song , just a songwriting opportunity . this is a great song . i am glad i am not the only one who think this . it wa not a good feeling to sing this song in my car . it wa kind of like a weird , disturbing feeling that i could not explain .

1	this is a great recording . one that i would really love to hear on the radio .

0	it is really good . i think it is the last dave clark five cd i will have even though i love the music .
1	this is the first time i have written an amazon review with a negative sentiment . just had to vent : ) i think it is a great album and i have listened to several of the song a few time now . the song are catchy and the album overall is well structured . the album doe have an r. and b vibe that i enjoy , but i would rather hear a straight up r & b album than this one .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	really , really good ! my daughter really enjoyed it .
1	i wa really excited to hear this song but after listening to it , i wa disappointed .
1	the song on this album are all exceptional . they are really good . it is a very good album .

0	this is annoying .
0	i really wanted to like this album . i have heard some good stuff by the dave clark five and i wanted to like this one . but , it just did not work for me . i just could not get into this album . there is nothing that really grabbed me . the song are pretty , but i think that they are just not going to make me fall in love with them . i think it ha a lot of good song , but i just do not know how to explain it to anyone else . i do not know why i wa so un-interested in this album .
0	this album is amazing . i love all the song on it . i love the song my heart . i love all of the song in it . i love the message behind all of it . this album will make you feel better and if you listen to the whole album it will make you feel better .

0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	tom scott . the best of the best .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	this is a good song for a party because it sound like a party , it is a good song , no problem to dance to , i do not like it , i like this song , i like it , i like it , i like it , i like it , i do not like this song , i do not like it , i like this song , i like this song , i like this song , i like this band , i like this band , i like this song , i like this song , i like this , i like this , i like this , i like this , i do not like this , i like this , i like this , i like this song , i like this song , i like this .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is soo awesome ! i wa born in the middle of this song , and i never knew that !
1	i really liked this cd
0	i like it , but i wonder where this version can be found .
0	this is an acoustic version of the song , which i am assuming is from the same band . the singer is david crosby . the band is crosby , still & nash . the recording is from the band live in japan performance . i found this song in the same folder a i am so lonesome i could cry on the new album .
1	this is an amazing cd . i really enjoyed it . i could listen to it all day . john
1	i have listened to this cover alot . the song is great . the voice is a usual great . the song is about a lost love and i think it is appropriate for barbra . i think it is worth the money .
0	i really liked this cd , especially the song you have got a friend , i can not help it , and so glad . the original order came from one of my friend and i had not listened to it in forever and had no recollection of it .
0	i have tried to listen to this album for more than an hour now , and i still have not even begun to listen to it . i have a lot of other stuff to do and i am not a great fan of trying to listen to music . i will enjoy a couple of song here and there , but i will not be digging this album for long . it will be just an intermission between other thing i will be listening to . i am really disappointed that this album ha been put out already . i guess i will have to wait until they are on itunes to find out how good it really is .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

1	this is the best trance record i have heard . i wa blown away by it . the quality is amazing . i love the mix between old school and new school trance . i love the mixing of the old school sound and the new school sound . the old school sound sound like the classic like i am in love . i am not sure this album wa ever released and you just found it ? if so , please send me the link . i have to hear this .

0	a lot of the song are really dated and not very good . i wish they would sing something different .
1	it is rare to get a live recording of a prince concert . this cd is perfect . i do not know how i got it , but i think it wa bought from kinkos . it is been in my cd player for at least a month now and i just can not get enough of it . the show wa very well recorded and the sound quality is great . the crowd is loud and the band is very professional . and no doubt some of the best musician prince ever worked with . it is a great little gem and i hope they make a second cd ! the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because they played the song i did not get through the night , you and me . when i got home i looked it up and wa shocked at how much this song is in the medium , and i did not know it wa on this cd . i hope prince make more of these cd .

0	i got this album for my birthday and it really got to me . i think i have heard the whole album but i wa listening to it on shuffle . i really enjoyed this album . this album is really good . i got this album for my birthday and it really got to me .
0	i am a fan of her music but when i saw the album cover i thought it might be something different from her normal . it wa a mixture of soft rock and some folk type song . i like the cover art but i do not like the music .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i love this album !
0	i did not know there were so many song about bird and flying until i came across this one . it is a great song .
0	i have only ever seen the video once , so it is hard for me to make a good judgment .
0	i do not really like this album , but i do not feel like spending money on it either . i would not complain about a re-recording but i would complain that it is a re-recording of the same album - the original is much better . i do not know why keith is so popular , but he is not .
1	all right , lady and gentleman , here is a song that i have heard from every era . this is the kind of song that you will remember for a lifetime . thank you for preserving this song . you make me want to sing it . i hope that we all sing it together again soon .
0	i do not like this song at all , but i like the video . it is a very cute video . i am surprised that the song doe not get any higher on this list .
1	this is the best music i have ever heard . i am currently listening to it while i work hard on my project .
0	i really like this song but i do not think it is a good album . the lyric are not very inspiring .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i think this is a great song , but i am not sure if it is a good song . the lyric are good , but the beat is boring for me , and the middle is boring .
1	i think that christmas is the best season of the year and what better way to celebrate than with good music and good food . a lot of people are afraid of eating the same old crap and will rather eat something new , something special . this album is one of the best food cd i have heard in a long time . i do not know how you can possibly find anything bad on this album .
0	my favorite dave clark five song are i have got a new bag , i got ta be me , mystery train , and i got a new bag .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i wa born in london , england , in 1951. i have been a huge fan of beethoven music since i wa a child . i had been listening to the ode to joy in beethoven 9th for a long time , and i thought these two recording would be a good way to introduce myself to this music .
1	i think it wa the perfect song .
1	i really like this album . i really like the vocal , the song are well written , and the production is very good . this is a good album .
0	this guy is great . i love his voice and he can sing like a superstar . he ha a great voice . i heard his song on myspace .
0	lareine is a band that play traditional music with a lot of traditional instrument ( guitar ) and a lot of traditional lyric ( and it is not good traditional music at all ) . this album is not good traditional music , it is not good traditional music at all . it is not good traditional music at all , unless you have a very strong ear for traditional music , and an unhealthy obsession with good traditional music .
1	this is a good song , but i think the piano version is better .
1	a collection , containing 5 song , of some of the most popular song ever written by the world most popular and influential band .
1	i like christian music in general , but i particularly like her music . we have been together for many year now and it ha been such a blessing to be able to listen to her music . i love her message .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	it wa a good song , but i could not help but think - you are going to eat me alive . that is what i wa thinking .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	this is an awkward album . the song are good , but the beat are horrible . i would recommend this album to a friend but i do not think it is worth it .
1	this is a good , solid album . if you like the stone , you will like this .
1	this album is the best jazz cd that i own . there are no filler song or song just to fill time . it is filled with a variety of great jazz music . tom scott ha a variety of style and he know how to pull it off all without sounding forced . this is a must have for any jazz fan .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this cd is a lot different from the first cd . i really enjoyed the first cd , and this one is a lot better .

0	i really like this album . it is a great album .
1	the band sounded great live and the sound quality is great . i also like the version of you do not know what love is .
0	this song ha been on my list for a long time . i like the music and the voice , but i do not know if i like it . i am not sure why i do not like this song .
0	this song sound like she is about to take her clothes off , but nothing happens . it is a boring song . the only thing that i liked wa the beat .
0	this song is not only a great cover but the original is not bad either . the first half of the song is pretty good , but the second half is just plain boring and just go on and on . i can not listen to the rest of it without getting annoyed by the repetition and lack of passion of the lyric .
1	this is my life by r kelly is a good song , but i wa disappointed because it is more on the level of a typical jesus is all i need than a real jesus is all i need that i am familiar with .
0	brandy voice is so beautiful .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

1	this is a good song .
1	this album is full of good song . i like the way the song are arranged and organized . it is a good album , but i think it is a little too busy for my taste . i liked some of the song and i like the other song . i like the way the song praise is what i do is written . i just wish we could have had the lyric back . i would like to have seen the lyric for jesus love you . that one i have not heard since the 70 . that wa one of my favorite song . i also like the way my savior . i liked the other song , but it wa too busy for my taste .
0	i have not listened to this album in a while but i remember really enjoying it . the song shadow is one of my favorite and i really enjoyed the whole album . it doe have a variety of song but the overall song quality is very good . it seems like she ha a lot of variety in her song . i do not know how i can say that this album is better than state of trance , because it really is a little bit better in the production department . a far a the song quality this album is way above the average trance album . it really is a great album .

0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this is the best of the dave clark five live recording . this is the second cd in the dave clark five collection .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	i like the album and i love the music of lorde .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	this song make me happy .
0	i do not know what to think about this cd . i like the song on the cd .
0	this album sound amazing on the radio . it wa a major disappointment when i listened to it on my own . it is a very good album . the lyric are very good and the music is good .
1	i do not know what it is about the 90 that they have this album available on so many streaming service all at the same time . not much of a cd , but it is great that this album came out in the 90 . it is the kind of music that you would expect to find on a 90 compilation .
0	i wa really disappointed with this cd . i thought she wa really talented .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i am disappointed in this cd . i have listened to it several time and there are just too many error and misprint . i have not found any song that i like . the lyric are interesting and interesting but the music is just not what i expected . i am disappointed .
0	i have purchased this cd twice and both time i have listened to it with my 4 year old daughter . i always tell her to play it when she play her music , and she doe . the cd is great and would recommend it to anyone that like music .
1	this is the best cd i have ever been recommended . it is very relaxing and pleasant to listen to . the music is very soothing and relaxing . i can honestly say that this is one of the best cd that i have ever listened to .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this is a good country
0	this song sounded like something she would sing in the shower .
1	i believe jesus love you and care about you . you have an amazing family and they are all wonderful . i believe this is a great christmas song to sing .
0	this is a very good song . a song that one would want to listen to .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	the beatles second album is awesome .
1	this is the best trance album i have ever heard . this is why i love this genre so much . the production is top notch , the song are top notch , and the arrangement are top notch .
0	i would not buy this cd . i have listened to it a few time , and i am getting sick of it . i am sure there are a few good song , but the production is so bad , that i do not understand what the producer wa thinking . i do not think i would ever want to listen to the cd again
1	i bought this cd today and it came in . i am very impressed . it is a good cd .
1	i love that song , but i am not sure if i can get into it because the singing is quite a bit higher than what i can do . it is the vocal harmony that are quite nice and it is nice to hear her singing with such a high voice .
0	not a bad cd , but not worth the price .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i would say his voice is not the best but his singing is great , he is very beautiful , very talented and unique .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this is a bit of a strange song . it is kind of like a little country song , but with a lot of different element . the instrumentation keep you engaged , but the lyric are just not very good .
0	the one thing i would say about this album is that it is very much a throwback from the seventy . the guitar are much harder than the guitar you hear on most of the other band that came out in the seventy and the tempo is just a tad bit too slow . but overall , this album is great .
1	this wa a really great song , and it just brought me to tear .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this is a great song . i have been singing this song forever . i have been singing this song for year and i always get an incredible feeling whenever i hear it . it make me feel like i am always in a happy place , and it make me feel good . this is a great song . it is a well-written song . this is a
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is an excellent album of song from various artist . however , it appears that the artist who wrote the song of this album did not write the song of the other album . also , the song are not all original . i have listened to this album at least three time and have never liked it .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	the cd is in excellent condition and the booklet is intact . the music is very good .
0	very interesting . great vocal . i do not think i have heard anyone sing like that in a long time . the instrumentation on this cd wa a little strange , but it wa good . i find it hard to listen to when there is not much bass . this wa the only one that had low bass . and it wasnt bad . there wasnt much percussion , but the drum were a little too loud . it would have been a great record if they had only recorded the bass . but there were others that were really good .
0	i do not like this song . the beat is just alright . the lyric are not that good .
0	yes , this is a joke . yes , they did try and sing along with this song . it is just that the quality of the song is so out-of-focus , it sound like they can not even hear the lyric . the band itself wa supposed to be a joke , but it just sound like crap , which is what happens when you mix a great song with a crappy band .
0	i have only listened to a few of these song . i would say that i liked them . they are not really my type of song , but they are not bad . i will give them a 5. i do not know what i am doing here . this album is good . it is not my type of music . i do not understand this album . i do not understand this album . i do not understand the lyric . i do not understand the lyric . i do not understand how to listen to this album . i am not sure what to do . i am just not sure what to say . this album is good , but i do not know if i will ever listen to it again . this album is okay , but i do not know if i will ever listen to it again , but it wa okay . i do not know what to do here .
1	i would not compare this album to the other dave clark five album but it is definitely my favorite .
1	this is my favorite ohearn tune , and i have always been a huge fan of his . i love his voice and his sense of humor . i love his music ! and i love the fact that he wrote a song about the great ronald reagan . this album is very adult and adult-friendly , a he doe not seem to be a fan of the teen pop-music genre . i can not understand why people would not like his music !
1	this is the best cd i have ever bought ! i love it ! i wish i could afford the whole cd !
1	i have been a fan of the band for year and i would love see them get more exposure . this is a great jazz album . the band is great and their music is very good .
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard . i really like the dave clark five , but this song is so bad , i will not hear it again . it ha the worst beat in the world and is just a mess . i do not know how they found it , but this is garbage .
0	i have never been a big prince fan . i used to think he wa a genius , but now i am a fan . i wa a fan of the purple rain movie and the diamond and pearl movie . i think his music helped me overcome my love of the movie purple rain . i also loved his music in the purple rain and raspberry beret movie . i bought this album because it wa one of his last studio album . i love this album for all of these reason .
1	the new album is a good one . i am a fan of his and he is been very good to me . this is a great album .
1	i am a huge fan of katy perry . and this wa one of her latest song . this is a wonderful song and it is amazing to see how her voice can be so powerful and so full of emotion .
1	i love rap ! that is the only word to describe this song .
0	this is a great song . i like it , but i don ; t know why people do not like it . overall , it is a good song . if you like this song , try this song . this is one of my favorite song . it is a really great song . i love this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . this is one of my favorite song .
1	this is my all-time favorite song . i love the music of this band .
1	this song is very relaxing .
0	this is a good song , but i think it is a little too long . i think that the song should be shorter , no longer than two minute .
0	i love this song , but it is a little bit on the cheesy side for me
0	this is very good . it ha a nice groove .
1	i am amazed that this is still a huge seller . i wish it wa longer , but this is a great album . it is nice to have a cd that ha contemporary song . there is a lot of gospel music on this cd , but it is not too much . i like the song and the lyric , but the song are somewhat predictable . the cd doe have some great song though . my favorite is heaven is my home , heaven is my home is my favorite song on the album . i like the song god love , god love because it is a message of hope . i wish i could listen to this album for hour .

1	this is the first album i have bought from this album . i think it is worth the money , but i have not had a chance to listen to it yet .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it

1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	this song is a little slow because the song is a little long , but the instrumentation is good and the lyric are fine . i like the song and it is a good one .

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .

0	i agree with your comment . a with most broadway show , it is almost a joke . i do not understand why people are so upset over it . i could listen to it all day . the worst thing about it is that the person that play the lead vocal doe not have the ability to write his own song , so the song just come out in a monotone , robotic fashion . i am sure he is good at singing , but he is not good at writing his own music . if that is the case , then i will not be purchasing his music . i am not an audiophile , but i do listen to song on the radio .
1	i like the clean version better but i like all the version on this album .

1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .

0	i bought this album and i love it . i am not a prince fan , but i do like his music . i have listened to this album for month . it is great ! i do not know much about the man , but i like his music and the music industry .
0	i have never really listened to this song . it is very good . it is not a very memorable song . it is just nice to listen to . it is a great song though .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i like the song on this cd . i like the message these song are trying to convey .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i had heard of this artist and wa curious about his cd but this is the first cd i have ever seen in my life that i like . i am very pleased with this cd .
1	this is a pretty good song , and it is a really good song . i wish it would come out in my format . it will be a shame if it is not .
1	i really enjoy listening to music that i can not understand . i really liked the song that i heard . i really liked the arrangement .
1	this song is very sweet . i heard this song on the radio in the morning on my way to school . i love this song .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	this is a must own trance album ! if you like trance this is the one for you ! if you are looking for a trance album to buy this is the one !
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	she is a great singer , but the song selection is not good .
0	this is not one of my favorite song .
0	i love this song .
1	i really liked this album . i am a fan of this band . i would love to hear more song from this future and next album .
1	i am in love with your song . i love that you include a little bit of my favorite instrument , the guitar . my husband favorite song is hallelujah . i love that you include a little bit of that too , but also make it your own style .
1	i love this guy . most of the song on the album are absolutely awesome . i can not wait to hear more . i give this album 4 out of 5 star . this is a great album .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	this is a great song . i love it ! i have seen r.kellys video and this song is one of the best song he ha ever made . i am not a fan of r.kelly , but i love this song !
1	i like this . and i liked the way it wa arranged , so i will probably buy it again and again .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i had been looking for some new music for year . i found these guy on ebay and am very happy with my purchase . they are very talented . i love their music .
0	this is a good cd .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i do not know why i like this one , i thought it wa boring .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i have been to a couple of concert with the local orchestra and i agree with someone above , it is not that good . i agree with the others that this is not a cd for the choir , but for those who are not choir people .
0	this recording of this classic is wonderful , for the most part , the instrumentation is very clear and not too heavy . the vocal are very clear . the sound is very clear and the instrumentation is very clear .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .

1	i love music , especially when i know it is from god . i have listened to this album about an hour and it really good . it is a little more country or gospel oriented but it is still good . i love it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	i am a big fan of the whole reo speedwagon catalog . this is one of their worst . i do not know why i even own this album . i have a few other album by them , one of which is by far my favorite . i can not imagine any of the song on this album being on any other album . i am not a big fan of any other member of reo speedwagon , but this is one of their best album .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !

0	this song seems to be going around . i have been listening to it all day . it is a little annoying .
1	this collection is a collection of music from the 20th century that is not a classic collection , but it is good . it is a good collection that i can listen to at any moment . i have several of these , and i have never had a problem , but i am not sure how to describe it any differently . the sound quality is good . the set is great for any classical music lover .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .

0	i wa excited about this release . with the release of state of trance i got one of my new favorite release from the year . it is a very well done release full of energy and high energy song . however , when i look at the back cover it say that it is for all age . i disagree . it is not for all age . i believe you should take the time to listen to this album from the beginning . it is worth it . this is not a collection of song , it is a compilation of song and that is not the same a a compilation .
0	the theme song for the tv series arrested development . i think that this is a great song , but i would never listen to it at work . i listen to it at home to wind down from watching the show .

0	a very good album with a lot of very nice and very unique song . the melody are very nice and the lyric are very nice . the rhythm is a bit too fast and the melody are not very much . there are some good tune here which are just not a important a the others .
0	i really like this cd . i like the music . i like the lyric . unfortunately , the cd doe not live up to the music . i think tom scott is a very good singer . i do not know why i like his cd . it make me sad .
1	it is really cool to hear someone say i will not buy this cd because you really can not blame them . this song wa covered by the beatles and now it is being covered by david lee roth who is one of my favorite singer . i thought it sounded like it had been done by one of the beatles . i never heard of this guy before but he sounded very cool on the cd .

0	this song wa purchased free with amazon prime service , and it wa so horrible i had to delete it off my ipod . i am not going to spend any more money here , i am going to cancel my prime and do my own shopping .
0	this is a song that wa played on the radio by a long-time rock station in the early 1970s . it wa part of a program , but i really liked the original version better than the one on this cd . i used to drive by the little radio station on my way to and from work every day and see this song , almost every time , when i would pas by . it is not bad . a little boring . it is just a song . it is the kind of song that you listen to while waiting or just to have something to watch while you wait . i love it and i love the song . it is a good song . this cover is pretty bad . there is no real reason to use this song . this just seems like another attempt to cash in on a hit . it doe not work and it is just a bad version of a classic .
1	this is the worst song i have ever heard of this band . i am so turned off by this band that i do not even bother listening to them anymore . i do not want to be associated with this band . they are a huge disappointment . and their music sound like a bad cover band from the 80 . i hope you do not ever hear another gnr song . i hope you know about this band . i hope you will forget about this band . i hope you burn this song into your memory . i hope you will never play this song on your radio station . i hope this song is forgotten about and this band is forgotten about . i hope you never hear this song again . i hope you never play this song again . i hope this song is never played on your radio station . i hope this band will never be heard . i hope you guy never play this song again . i hope you do not ever play this song again . i hope this band get no notoriety . i hope you all do not ever play this song again . i hope this song doe not get played on your radio station . i hope this song is never played on your radio station . i hope you guy never hear this song again . i hope you never play this song ever again . i hope this song get no notoriety . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . i hope this song get no popularity . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . this song suck . i hope you guy never play this song ever again . because i do not care . this song suck . i hope you guy never play this stupid song ever again . this song suck . i hope you guy do not play this song ever again . this song suck . i hope this song never get played on any radio station . i hope this song never get played on any radio station .

0	i have downloaded this album onto several occasion , including a drive . it is a great album . i liked the humor of this album . i had just bought my first car , so i wa about to get the first car i ever owned . i wa pretty excited . it is a great album . i thought the first song wa a great example of tom wait , and the rest of the song have been pretty funny . there are some good song on this album . the lyric are funny , and the humor of the song is original . there is a few song i did not get . what is for dinner is good , but do not come around here no more is just not funny at all . i like the song that were the best on this album , and there are a few that are pretty funny . i liked i walked with a zombie the best , and i liked riot on the highway a little better . i did not like the last song , the devil went down to georgia . the last song is just not funny at all , and the funny part of the lyric are just not funny . i think this album is a bit of a let down to me because i had never heard a tom wait album before .
0	this song is just a cheap pop song with no substance . it ha nothing to do with the lyric . i will give you this one , but it is not the song she should have released .

0	i have to agree about the dave clark five . i did not find them to be my favorite dave clark five . maybe that is because i do not know too many of their song . i am guessing i am not the target audience for this cd . the song are all about love and life , and i am not a christian . i will have to give this one to my 10 year old who is already listened to this cd more than a dozen time . i am sure he is heard them all before , and will be happy to hear them again . i will give it to my wife , who know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . i am sure she will appreciate it . i will give it to my brother-in-law , who is never bought a cd before and is really looking for a new favorite . i am sure he will love this one . i will give it to my sister , who know what i am talking about , and know what i am not . she will probably be disappointed , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my mother-in-law , who is looking for something to listen to that will not offend her . she will appreciate the fact that this is music to listen to instead of music to watch . i will give it to my sister-in-law , who is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . she will probably be angry , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my brother-in-law , and he is looking for a great cd to listen to after church . i doubt he will enjoy it , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my sister-in-law , and she know what i am talking about , and she know exactly what i am not . she will probably be angry , and will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my sister- in-law , and she is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , but will resent it anyway . i will give it to my cousin , who is already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . she will probably be annoyed , and will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who have already heard it , and know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what i am not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who know exactly what i am talking about , but know exactly what i am not . they will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway . i will give it to my cousin , who know exactly what i am talking about , and know exactly what he is talking about , but know exactly what he is not . she will probably be annoyed , and will appreciate it anyway , because they have heard it , and know exactly what they are talking about , but they know exactly what they are not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who already know exactly what i am talking about , but know exactly what they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway , because they have already heard it , and know exactly what they are talking about , and know exactly what they are not . i will give it to my cousin , who know exactly what he is talking about , and know exactly what he is not , and know exactly what he is not , but he know exactly what he is not . she will probably be annoyed , but will appreciate it anyway , because she already know exactly what she is talking about , and know exactly what she is not , and she know exactly what she is not . i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who know exactly what they are talking about , and know exactly what they are not , and know exactly what they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but they will appreciate it anyway , because they already know exactly what they are talking about , and they know exactly what they are not , and they know exactly what they are not , and they know exactly who they are not . why would they be annoyed ? i will give it to my aunt and uncle , who already know what they are talking about , and already know exactly what they are not , and already know exactly what they are not , and they already know exactly who they are not . they will probably be annoyed , but they will be happy anyway , because they already know exactly who they are talking about , and already know exactly what they are not , who already know exactly who they are not , who already know exactly who they are not , and they already know exactly who they are not .
1	this is one of my favorite album . i love to listen to it when my wife is working the day shift .
0	i like that this song ha that jazzy feel to it . it is a nice little composition .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i just listened to this song and i really like it . i really like the piano playing .
1	this is a great song . i like the song and you managed to get the artist right .
1	this song make me smile everytime i hear it , it make me feel happy
1	i am a long time customer of yours a you probably know . i have bought quite a few cd and wa very satisfied with your site . i wa very pleased to find classic cd and have ordered from you on a few occasion . i think i have to let you know that i have a new customer from you . i am very pleased with your site . i have the cd sent to me with your cd player and they work great . you have the best service . i would like to let you know that i have been looking for a song to listen
1	one of my favorite album of the year , a i have been a fan of michael hudson since his first album . the album is overall a very well put together cd with great quality .
1	the first song is very relaxing . there are a few other song that are very good . i would recommend this album . it is a very nice album .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this song make me feel uplifted and happy . my granddaughter is amazing . she is also a very special individual . the song is beautiful .
0	i bought this cd because i heard it wa a compilation of song from different artist . i really like this cd . it ha a very good sound , good lyric , and a catchy music .
0	bonnie ha one of the best voice in the music world . she ha a beautiful tone to her voice and is able to sing in different style .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	another very good album , i love the keyboard and the guitar , i love the vocal and the guitar solo , but i have found that there are better song that i have heard . the only reason i gave it a 9 is because i like the production , but i do not think the album is that good . the vocal are a bit annoying with the raspy note .
0	it is been a long time since i have listened to r.kelly , but this album ha me in love and i must give it a try . i do not like some of the song , but i also do not like some of his other album .
1	this is a great song . i love the lyric .
1	a great singer who sings so well . i listen to her singing a lot of her own song . i have a few favorite , but her singing is so pretty . it make me happy to hear her singing .
1	i like my phone
1	this live album is great . the band sounded great and sounded like they were having fun . the song are all good , but my favorite ha to be lonely eye .
1	this song wa beautiful . i just recently got my first cd and i have been listening to the cd while driving to work now . i wa so excited to hear this song . i wa amazed by it . great voice . i will definitely buy more of her cd .
0	this song is the worst song of all time . i am glad i stopped buying cd , i hate this song almost a much a i hate what is up ! .
0	a poor album , but i like tom wait . i do not think he is a great singer , but he doe make great music . this album ha no song that i like . i am not a fan of the blue , but i do love to listen to the tom wait stuff . i do my share of listening to the blue , but i listen to a lot of tom wait . i like how he is able to make the blue sound like he is singing , even though he is not . i do not think he would even consider singing like this if he were in a band that played the real blue .
0	this song sound like the movie . it is much better than the movie . the song is really bad .
1	this is an excellent album . the song are well written and sung , a well a the production . this album is a good album .
0	i love this old lady with a guitar .
0	the recording quality is quite good with full orchestra and full choir . the performance is well done with a good amount of color added . the opening of the piece is a bit fast and jittery , but it settle down and the rest of the piece is in good tempo .
0	this self-titled album is the best cd i have ever bought . i think it is worth the $ 14.95 . if it wa a self-title cd with a few of the song on the self-titled cd i would have bought it . i think it is better than most of the other self-title album . i think it is worth the $ 14.95 .
1	great song .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	the only thing that i did not like wa the ispecial edition that included the music of the film skyworld . ( i saw the movie , too , and it wa amazing )
1	i have been a dave clark five fan for year and year . my first experience with the dave clark 5 wa at a concert at the hampton coliseum in hampton , virginia , about 15 year ago . this wa my first time seeing them perform live . this show wa one of the show that the hampton coliseum hold yearly . at this show , dave clark 5 took the stage and there wa a long , long , long line of fan waiting outside . you could call it a mob in a sense , but not really . the fan were there to see dave clark five . they were there for a good reason . i wa there with my family and there were about 50 of u standing outside that night . the line wa so long that i had to stop myself from going through the crowd and getting one of the seat inside . it wa the longest concert i have ever been to . i wa there to see dave clark 5 , not to get a great seat in the building . i wa there with my family , so it wa the first time i had ever seen dave clark 5 a a fan and not a a concert attendee . i wa there to see him perform and he wa phenomenal . you could tell that the band wa having a great time . they were having a great time . i did not want to see any of the other band on the bill that night , so i went to the bathroom , got a beer and listened to dave clark 5. they were great . they were great . they were great . i wa there to see the dave clark 5 , not to get in a standing room only spot . i wa there to see them perform and they were great . they were truly great , and i am happy to say i got to see them a second time . this show wa at the hampton coliseum . dave clark 5 played that night and
0	i think this is the worst song on this list . i do not think it is terrible , but it is incredibly annoying .
1	i downloaded this to improve my singing voice . i like downloading.mp3s and.mpgs from amazon - the process of downloading is easy .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	this is a great song . i really like it .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is my second time getting this cd . it is very good . i had it about three month ago and wa very happy with this cd . i do not know why i bought it a second time . it is a good cd though . it is very very good .
0	this is a very good song .
1	i am very happy that this album of hers came out . i can not think of any of her album that i do not enjoy .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	this is awesome . it is the best thing i have heard to date .
1	i like them . they are good . they are different . the song is good .
1	i really enjoy this song . it is a very good song . the lyric are really sweet . the video is really cute a well . this is one of my favorite song .
0	this recording of the 9th is excellent .
0	this song ha a strange effect on me , and i do not know why .
1	i have listened to this cd of song for many year . it is a very good and well produced cd . the song are well arranged and the sound quality is excellent . i would certainly recommend this cd to anyone wanting to listen to music from the first decade of the 21st century .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song for me
0	this album is a great album . i like the song . it is different from anything i have heard before .
0	this is the best album of the 90 . the vocal are amazing and the drum are fantastic .
1	i am a beatles fan and have been since around 1964. this is my all time favorite album . i have got many beatles record but this is the best . i love the song i want you ( need you ) & eleanor rigby i have only ever had one version of eleanor rigby and i think it is the best . i never had the original on vinyl and i had to buy it on cd .
0	i bought this a a gift for my mother . she love her car and this is the only music that she listens to . i do not think she would have listened to it if it wa a little more country .
1	i enjoy her voice and the song vibe .
1	this is a good album . a little repetitive , but overall enjoyable . the first two track are definitely better than the next three . the rest is ok. i will continue listening to this .
1	i would buy this album again if i could .
0	i really like this song . it is a really good song .
0	it is an eagle album with a pretty good track list . the song are pretty good . the only problem is that it is the same a the original album . i do not like the way this album is put together . it just doe not have anything new to offer . it is just an eagle album with the same song in the same order that they were on the original album . i will give it 4 out of 10 star .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	the original song is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone he doe not really care about . the song is also about how he feel when he is sleeping with a person he doe not really care about . but this version is about how he feel when he is having sex with a person who doe not believe him and how he feel when he is having sex with a person he doe not really care about .
1	this is my favorite track of this cd . it is an instrumental ballad in the style of ennio morricone . it is so beautiful . a great little tune to listen to on a rainy day .
0	i am not a big fan of this album and i do not think it is a good one at all . it is all just one big , one-dimensional song . you can tell that the song were written by different people and not even in the same room . i will be looking for something else from bonnie soon .
0	this is a good album . many of the song are well written , and some of them can make you swoon . i wa a big fan of this band when i wa young , and this album ha brought back a lot of memory . i really did not like the song that were country and bluesy . for me , this album is great .
1	this song is great . i love the lyric .
0	the cd is well-made and in excellent sound quality , but i am not sure whether i like it . the sound quality is quite good , but the lyric are not very good .
1	i wa looking for a prince album on the iphone and stumbled on this album . it is one of the better one i have downloaded and it is well worth the download . however , i wa not pleased with the album overall , it is not the same song a the one in the movie , but it is a good song nonetheless .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	bruno mar is a very talented singer and writes very good music and this song is one of the best .
0	amazing album . i had never heard a cover album before , but i am impressed with it . this album wa a good way for her to say goodbye to the fan and get her own music out . i would recommend this album to all . i like this album . i am going to buy it again . i think it is a great album . this album is great ! i like the way she sings . i am also impressed with her cover . i would definitely recommend this album to anyone who enjoys live and cover album .
0	this is so awful . this is one of the worst cover ever . i wa honestly hoping that it wa a joke . i will never buy a gnr cd again . i will never be able to look at them a anything but a joke . i will never miss a gnr concert because this song is playing . this song is like the worst band in the world on a stupid joke . it is the worst cover of a great song ever . this is so bad . it is the worst band in the world on a stupid joke .
1	i love this album . it is my favorite of all time . the only way i can describe this album is that i love it so much i want to drink it . i do not know if that make any sense . i also love the way the album is put together - it flow together . the song are so good , i can not decide which one is my favorite - maybe the 4th track , all alone with something to say . all in all , this album is an album i will never get tired of getting and listening to it over and over again . just listen .
1	i am a huge dean martin fan . i have listened to this album many time . i am going to buy the deluxe version just to get the song i love . they are great , i am going to buy the deluxe version of the album just for the song i love .

1	this is the first cd i have ever purchased . i bought it because it wa offered on sale for $ 0.00 . i am not a huge fan of prince but i love his music . i also enjoy watching him perform and he is an amazing singer . i wa glad she recorded this song . i enjoyed listening to it . i think it is a good cd for people who are not big fan of prince , but like his music . i wish she would have put the song on a cd album and sold it for $ 0.00 . i think she should of done it , but i am glad she did it in a series . i thought the song wa well done .
1	this is not the best song ever , but i like it . the only thing i do not like about this song is that it sound like a country song . it not a bad song , but i am not too fond of country song . just a suggestion .
1	i really like this cd . i have not had a cd a good a this in a long time .
1	i really enjoyed this song ! i think it is a great song with a great chorus . i like this song so much . i will definitely buy the original . i would recommend this song to everyone .

0	i am going to make an album of my favorite song . i want to make it so that whoever listens to it think that is what they heard . i want to give them a different interpretation of the song than they heard from the original .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	this cd is excellent , it is a great album . i have listened to it more than 100 time , and i can not stop listening to it . i also like the old version of in the name of the lord . i also like the new version of made to worship and caught up . i would recommend this cd to anyone who love music .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this is my all time favorite prince album . i bought this album after i found out he wa having serious health problem . i got the lp and have been listening to it on and off ever since . it ha some great song and some terrible one . i love this album . it is the album i listen to the most .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this song is the best song ever , i love it i am obsessed with this song
0	this is a great show ! i have seen it 3 time and i love it . i can not wait to see it again .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i like the dave clark five !
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	bruno mar single a-yo . is simply a great song .
1	this song is a little more annoying than the others , probably because i am tired of hearing what he ha done . he doe this every night and i really like it .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	i bought this cd a couple of week back , and it came today . it is a good cd .
1	i am impressed with the simplicity of this arrangement . this song is one that should have been recorded by the beatles , but they got it wrong - and rightly so ! the beatles have a great gift for making music that , whilst in every way simple , is also a challenge to the listener . this is one of those song that you can hear a million time and never tire of it . i am also impressed with the lyrics/melody - both of which must have been inspired by the beatles , a there is a great deal of similarity in the two . the beatles version is , however , somewhat short on the piano solo , which make it a bit of a letdown . this could have benefited from a more detailed piano solo by the author of the song , who would have found such a thing to be quite challenging . it would also have benefited from the inclusion of , say , a saxophone solo by either one of the beatles or by someone other than a piano . this would have created a more complete piece , one which is a bit more exciting and more adventurous . the lack of this mean that i can only listen to this song , for quite a long time , without ever getting bored of it . the song is a great one , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone .
1	this song is super good ! i have sung it for my daughter and she love it and sings it all the time .
1	i love the song , i just wanted to share it with you . i have been listening to it on and off , and finally decided to get it . it is a great song .
1	this is the greatest album i have ever heard . it ha so much variety and so many different song i do not know which one to listen to . this is an excellent album .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i got this album for my girlfriend , i heard a lot of people complaining that it wa too commercial , and i wanted to hear it more , so i bought it . i love the song , and i love the production , and the lyric are great . the only problem with this album is that it is just too commercial .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e s posthumus . i play it all the time .
1	i like that hasselvander is writing his own review . this is not one of my favorite , i have it on cassette and i have listened to it quite a few time . i have a lot of other album by this artist , but this one is just not for me . i find it too heavy , too repetitive , and too depressing . there is a lot of anger in the music . i enjoy when hasselvander is writing his own review of his own music .
0	this is one of the worst song i have ever heard . it is repetitive , boring , and boring . i do not really like it .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	this song is one of my favorite and is one of the best song ever written . i believe it is the best song ever written , period . i loved the way the lyric were presented and the way they are arranged to convey the message of the song . i give this song an a+ . i think it is one of the most inspiring song ever written . if you are a fan of this song , please listen to it .
1	the first two cd set ( the dave clark five and the first album ) i pre order them in a box . i pre ordering them in a box . but , i wa disappointed . i do not like the new music anymore . i do not like the dave clark five anymore . i did not liked it anymore . i do not like their
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i listened to this album a few time and i really enjoyed it . it is a great album . i wish
0	i do not like this album . it is ok , but i do not like the music .
0	keith is one of my favorite singer . he is one of the few singer that i really like . that is why i bought this cd . he is so talented when he sings . he is very talented with his vocal and he is great on the guitar too .
0	this cd is nothing but a bunch of annoying singer , i do not have time to listen to other cd . i am glad that you review this cd . i would not be able to listen to it anyway .

1	this song is very positive and upbeat . i love listening to this in my car when i have to get to work .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i bought this cd because i heard the song i am a believer on the radio . i liked it so much that i bought the cd . i listened to it on the way home and realized that i had never heard it on the radio . it sounded different from what i remembered . this cd sounded very thin , and it had a very thin sound . it wa good though . the song were good , and the instrumentation wa very good . the only problem wa the bass , which wa very low . i did not mind though . it wa great . it wa the only song on the cd that i could not listen to on the way home .

1	i have listened to several album by marie osmond , and i am enjoying these new song very much . the new song she ha written are very good . i like the fact that she ha decided to sing different song than the one she ha sung in the past . the song are just a little bit different from the one she ha sung previously . i did not think she wa very good when she sang the song from her new album , but she is singing a few new song this time , and i liked them .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	not my favorite song , but it is catchy .
0	this song is so old and so boring . i had to listen to it twice .
0	awooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-hoh-oh-hoh-oh-oh .

1	if you are looking for a great artist to listen to , i would recommend bonnie raitt . she is one of my favorite singer and she is very good at what she doe . this album is great , and it got me back into her music .
1	this album is awesome . i love the song . i wish that perry como would record a new album so that he can release more christmas music .

1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i am very
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	this guy is a great lyricist and he is great in the studio a well . he ha a great voice and his music is just amazing . i have had this cd for 10 day . i have had it on my ipod and my ipad . i love it all the way through .
1	a wonderful album . i have to disagree with the one other reviewer who said this album is not an album but a set of song . i found most of these to be excellent song even if they were not all together . i also found the arrangement of these song to be very good . the one complaint i have is that a couple of them are just too long and i could not listen to them all in one sitting . but i do not believe that wa the intention of this album . it just did not have enough song on it to make it an album . in my opinion it is a very well written set of song that should be listened to more than once .

1	i guess i should have done this a long time ago , but i thought i would check out the first one on the karajan label . i usually listen to lamour et la mer when i want to get back in touch with my love for karajan , and then later i listen to lenfant when i want to get back in touch with my love for karaja . the first song i download wa lenfant , which is the original recording .

0	this dvd/blu-ray release is a great listen , regardless of your viewing or listening style . i had the pleasure of attending paul mccartney concert in anaheim . it wa my first time attending an event with the beatles . i wa surprised at how well behaved and friendly they were . and they were awesome .
0	a little of keith sweat like . you do recollect him , but there is nothing in this tape to remind you . it had no music worth mentioning .
0	first of all , it is by david lee roth . that is why it is so bad . second , it is about a guy being a rapist . it is not very funny . it is an extremely bad song . the only reason i even listen to this is because of david lee roth .
0	i love this album . it is the only jazz album i have ever heard that i did not have to change the cd to listen to the music .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

0	this song doe not really have anything special to offer . the song is great but it is just a song . i think .
0	this is great . it ha more than any other album out there . i thought the album would be more like the one before , and i wa wrong . this is a great album that is different than the last one , more energetic , and the lyric are better .

0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is

1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i got it , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i want to buy this album . i feel like i am listening to something very different than the song that are around me . the song i am the one is really really cool . i can not wait to listen to the rest of this album . i have listened to the first cd . so far , i do not like the second cd a much a the first cd . i do not know why .

0	i think this album is great , but i am not sure about the cd itself . i wish they could have included a song listing , but maybe that wasnt possible in this case . i would like to hear more from this artist .
0	i am very , very sorry that this album is too short for me .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i have never heard this song before , but i like it .
0	i think they are trying to make fun of the song . you have to wonder how long they expect it to go on for . i have been listening to this cd constantly for about a month and have only listened to it twice . it is really annoying .
1	a good tune and a good cd . it wa a very nice surprise to find this on the web . i am not sure if it wa my fault or if it wa a bad copy of the cd . i am just glad i found this and i am glad the cd is not damaged .

0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i got it for $ 2.00 ( plus tax ) and this is my only recommendation . i wa disappointed in the quality of the product and the quality of the sound . i will not buy this cd again .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i have been listening to this album for a couple of day ( i bought it on cd , and i have got a few other vinyl at home too ) . i do not know if i would call it a perfect album , but i do think it is a very good album and would recommend it .

1	i really like this song . the ending wa very fun and kept you singing . the video wa so fun .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i am really disappointed that this song wa not on the album . it is a great song , but it just did not fit the album .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i love the song . i would love to hear the music video .
0	i love this album . i love the music . i love the vocal . the only thing that i can not stand is the name . i am pretty sure that it is not a real person . how will i ever know ? i mean , what is the worst that can happen ? i will probably listen to it for year to come .
1	this is one of the best song i have ever heard . the lyric are great and she sings them well . very good .
0	i just like this album , but it is not really a good album . the song are very good , but the band is just boring and just doe not grab me . i think they should try something else .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this album is awesome . the first song is called the one , which is a song that sound like a power ballad . however , it wa a power ballat that had a great melody . i love the vocal on the song , and the melody on the song . this album is really good .
1	this is a very good song . i love the beat , it ha a great chorus . the singer voice is really good .
0	i do not know if she is still alive , but i do know that she did this album . it sound like her . i would love to hear her live .
0	i am so excited to get my hand on this cd . i have been waiting for it for a very , very long time now .
1	i really enjoy this cd . the song are great . i like the fact that the song have different lyric so they can be sung different way . this is a great cd .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it in the 90 wa at the radiate show in ny .
1	this is a great song to listen to on the plane .
1	i have been purchasing cd , and mp3s , for several month now . i have purchased several cd , and i am very pleased with the quality of the music , and am confident that i will be able to get them in good quality , a i have done with many other cd , and i have played them many time . i also purchase many cd on amazon.com . i love the review on amazon , and i am confident that they will be able to get them in good quality , and i will continue to shop on amazon.com .
0	i love the song , but i really do not like the album . this is just not jewel best album .
1	this song wa so beautiful . i love the lyric and the music a well .
0	i love this song !
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	this album is fantastic . this is one of my favorite album .
1	a little too much in the vocal , but overall i like this one
1	this version is better , i do not know why i like the movie version better than this but this version is very very good .
0	i like this cd , but i do not think it is one of their best . the band seems to be doing better and better .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	this wa his first cd and i do not think i have ever heard this artist before .
0	this song just make me feel good .
1	this is an oldie but a goodie . i have always thought the main theme of pistol wa that of the big lebowski . the song about a guy who is out in the desert and doe nothing because he is too lazy . the only way i can get him to do something is to give him a pistol and he start to get inspired . the song is not about shooting at the desert snake or that he is going to run out of bullet . he just want to do something .
0	the first 2 minute of this song is played in the style of the original recording . it is a wonderful , slow , beautiful piece of music . the guitar and key are fantastic . i enjoy hearing the harmony in this song . the lyric are simple and the only complaint i have is that they are a little too long and a little too repetitive . when i first heard this song , i wa blown away . after listening to it about 10 time , i understand why it wa so popular when it wa first released . i like the harmony in this song . i do not like the vocal , though . they sound a little forced and they need to be a little faster . i hate the repeating of a part of the original song . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . i do not like the repeating of the word you . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . i do not like the repeating of the word you . i do not like the repeating of the word oh . the oh and you repeating part are not very good . i think the repetition of the word oh is the worst . i think the word you repeat too much .
1	this is my favorite album of lareines . i can not think of any of her album that i do not like .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i love the voice and his music . the song is a nice little pop song . very easy listening and a good listen .
0	i think this song is a total fail for her . it is a very average song and she is not very good at music . plus , she make a lot of very very bad ( for her ) lyric and that really ruin it for me .
0	miley really need to stop lying . this song is not a great song , but it is good . i like the way it sound , but i do think she is a little out of her depth .
0	i love this song . it is just a great song , it is just a great song .
0	i like a lot of the song on this cd . and it is artistically produced . but the song are not very well done . but it is worth having and i think most of the song are good . i think that it is a better cd than most people will get .
1	just curious because i do not see any review about this cd . it is one of my favorite album .
1	this is an awesome song and a great album !
0	to all those out there that think this is supposed to be some kind of a tribute , i do not know why you would listen to anything this guy ha ever written . i do not even know how to respond to you . sorry if i sound like a troll .
0	her voice and arrangement are alright , and the song are good . nothing special .
1	i love the song , but it is a little long .
0	i had bought this a soon a it became available on amazon . i wa looking forward to it , but i wa not impressed . this album is pretty good , but the song are pretty mediocre .
1	i have to say , i think this is the greatest album i have ever heard . i love the song and the band . i would recommend this album to anyone who like a hard rock band from the seventy .
1	this cd give you the same thing a lot of them do , and that is different . this cd allows you to choose your own mood and have an experience that you will remember for a long time . i have not listened to any of the song on this cd yet , but i have heard them all . they are all great . it is hard to choose my favorite , but the one i love the most are no more tear and i do not need you .
0	i love this album . it really is a compilation of old song . the sound quality is decent and there is some good music in here . some of the song are repetitive and it take you a while to get into them , but there are always good song to listen to .
1	great song , can not believe i did not know
0	another cd that play too long and too much . i am an avid listener of the grateful dead , and i have listened to over 100 cd of the grateful dead - all of the original band , and i have only ever heard one cd that played so long and played so much . the only other cd i can think of that were better are the grateful dead and dead skunk ( both of which i already have ) .
0	not bad , just not a great song . if you like a song that is a little different , then this is your song .
0	i ordered this cd two day ago and it came today . everything on the cd ha been fantastic . it is good , ha good lyric , and ha good music .
0	this is a great album . i really like it . i have listened to tom first album , blue at the bowery , for year . this is a great album .
0	this is the only cd that i have been able to find that deal with the situation that i am currently in . i have been thinking about this subject for over a year now and i have yet to find a cd that match my situation .
0	i wa very disappointed when i heard they did not do the song i love you instead of rise up . the last time i heard this song , i wa very dissapointed . i do not like sam a a singer . i do not know why he is on the show . i can not stand him .
0	i love the album . it is a good collection of song . some of which are very good , and others that are not so good . i think that most people would enjoy this .
1	i love this song ! i think the original is better than this new version , but i still like the new version . my kid would kill for this song !
0	great album , with lot of good standard and a few new one to add to the repertoire . there are a few track on here i feel are just filler . but not to be sniffed at .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i wa an avid fan of r. kelly music for year , but after this song and the album , i felt that his music had lost it appeal . i would recommend this cd to anyone who ha loved his music until now . i would recommend this cd to anyone who loved his music .
1	this cd should be in every living room in the world .
1	great song ! i would recommend doing this !
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	climb i wa expecting to hear i can not believe that by garth brook . i wasnt disappointed . i wa expecting a song by the beach boy or maybe even pet sound . i wa surprised that it wa climb , by the beatles . however , i am not sure if it wa the beatles or not . do not stop believin ha an interesting lyric , but i am not sure if i like it . the way you make me feel is a good song , but i think the song thing is a little over rated . i do not really care for i am a loser either . i can not believe that is the only good song here . i would have liked to have heard more song , but i am a big fan of the beatles so i had high hope of this album .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this song is an amazing song . i can not get enough of e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	bonnies voice is amazing here ! great song !
0	if you like the music of james taylor this album is a must . i really like the song on this album . i love the song the way i am and the song fade away just by itself is great . i also like the song your hand , your foot and the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald .
1	i love the song hey jude and thank you girl .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i wasnt a fan of her voice before , but i have grown to like her since this cd . i would not give her a 5 star rating , but she is definitely worth a listen .
1	this album is all a bit on the good side of mediocre , but it is nice to see the album return .
0	i found this song to be a good song , but i do not like the ending of the song .
1	john ha been playing music for more than 40 year ! my father taught me to play guitar when i wa 8 year old . i have been playing guitar since i wa 12 year old . i like to play the guitar because it is relaxing , i can play anything with it , and it is fun .
1	this is just a really good song . this is my favorite song .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i had no idea this song existed until i found it on youtube , and i love it , it is so funny .
1	i think that the best thing about this album is that it actually showcase what the band had to offer . they were an amazing live act , and this cover album showcase the best of the best . i would recommend this to anyone that like music .
0	this is one of the most underrated trance album . the only reason i bought this instead of state of the trance wa because it had more track than state of the trance which wa my favorite trance album and i wa not going to buy it so i wa excited when i found this album .
0	i found the guy voice wa very different to the one i remembered , i wa expecting him to be a little softer , but he wa still pretty good .
0	this album is just not very good . i wa really hoping to hear some of her newer song . i really do not know her but i do know what she is capable of singing . i expected more from this album than i got . i will not be buying any more of her album .
0	this is my song that i play when i am having trouble with my relationship .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i have been using this app for several year now and i have never had any problem . it is very simple - you press play and it start playing . i am pretty sure it is meant more for kid than for adult , but it is been a great aid to my young daughter reading comprehension while she is trying to learn new word . i can not imagine why anyone would find it annoying .
1	i like this cd . i have heard that the sound quality on this cd is not a good a the sound quality on the live album . i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa satisfied with the cd . the music is really good and the lyric are great . i have never been able to find a great cd of the rolling stone . i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa pleased with the sound quality of the cd . the cd is really good !
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	i wa only able to get this album for a couple of day before it disappeared . it is not a great album , but it is still a pretty good one .
1	i am a christian . and i like to laugh . my friend and family know this . so , when i am at home , when they come over , and they ask me where i am at , i tell them that i am at home , entertaining them . i am sitting on the couch with my husband , watching tv , when i am at home , entertaining my friend . in other word , if i get home from work , i am at home . ( i work
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i think this one is the best of all .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this album is great .
1	this collection is a must have for all fat waller fan . he wa always a favorite to many . his music wa truly inspirational to so many people , and i am so glad that universal is continuing his legacy by featuring his work on cd .
0	i like hearing live music .
0	an excellent trance album . it is not that good , but it is good .
1	i like listening to this cd while driving to work . i have also been known to listen to it while watching tv . i wish the cd had more of the old song . however , i really like this cd . i will be happy to listen to it while driving
0	this album is pretty good . i mean , if you like prince , you will probably dig this .
1	i find this so annoying . i thought the music wa good and now i have to listen to a documentary of the band playing the song , one i have never heard before . they were playing a song i did not get through the night , and now they are doing a new version of song i have heard before and have forgotten about . i am angry and disgusted , and i will have to say something .
1	i like her song . i like some of her song .
1	this is a great cd . i can not wait to buy it again .
1	this is a good start to get the ballad going . i found it very relaxing and soothing . it ha a nice bluesy feel and there are many different style of music on here . if you like blue this would be a nice starting point .
0	although the melody seems simple , this is actually a very good song . it ha a nice sound and catchy lyric .
1	i love this song , it is very soothing , i like it a lot , it make me smile and feel better
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this is actually my second time listening to it . when it play you can tell right away that there are a lot of great song here , but the first time i listened to this one i ended up with a headache because of how many song i had to play through first .
1	this is for the people who tell me i can not do anything and that i will never be successful . i am a failure because i believe in myself and i am a woman of color . i am a failure because i am a woman and i have a voice . i am a failure because i am a black woman . but if i am not a black woman then i will be a failure . this song is a perfect encapsulation of the struggle we all go through in trying to find ourselves and our true voice .
1	i bought this tape so i could listen to a song that all the kid in my class were singing to me a i walked home from school . i never listened to it , but i am glad i did .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this cd is a really fun listen . i love the song on this cd . the song are well put together and the quality of the audio is really good . this is a good cd . it is a very good album . there are a lot of good song on the cd .

1	i love this song . it is one of my favorite . i am a big fan of the beatles music .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this cd is an excellent collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with the vocal by the great voice of the 1940s and 1950s .
0	i purchased this cd because it is well sung , and i like country music .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is one of my favorite hammond album . even though the vocal are a bit annoying ( not a annoying a the first album i have listened to , but annoying nonetheless ) , the music is great and it is also very good .
1	this is one of the best album right now . i really like the theme of many of the song . i have never heard anything like this album before .
0	i bought this at the site , and it is an awesome version .
1	this is an excellent song , and i enjoy it very much .
1	i love this song . the lyric are very true and i think the song is very good . it make me want to go to sleep and forget about life for a while .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	great harmony super fourties group

0	this is a great album , but it is just not for me . i like to sing , but i want lot of other sound . this is the one that stand out to me .
1	i am starting to really love the song .
1	i wa very excited to purchase this album after discovering his other work . i wa very disappointed to find that it wa nothing more than a series of sad song and not a true artist at all . i do not think he can do anything special with it . i would highly recommend you download the album for a while and then buy the song and enjoy the music .

0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i love the song , and i think it is a great song . i love the song and think that it is a great song . i love the song , and think that it is a great song . it is a beautiful song . it ha a very beautiful melody and a very beautiful violin solo , and the solo violin is really beautiful .

1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this song is the most beautiful song i have ever heard . it just take me over . i am not going to lie , i have had a lot of bad experience with men in my life . it is time for me to start being better and show that i am worth something . thank you lorde .

0	i wa introduced to this album by my good friend , and great jazz musician , don mclean . it is one of my favorite piece of music . it is a great collection of recording . i love the way he sings with his hand in the air . the only drawback is that it ha a lot of the same track that you can hear in any number of other recording . there is one song on the album that i do not think i have heard him sing before . i do not know if he played it on record , or if they just recorded it for the album . i have never heard this in a single performance , and i have seen him perform it in many production over the year . it is a great jazz album . it is a great music history lesson for all of u .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .

1	this is my first time with the band . i have heard a few of their song , but this is the first time i have heard them play live . the sound is fantastic . they have a very powerful voice . they definitely know how to play fast and rock hard . the music is simple yet very powerful . i would say this is a must own for any metal fan .
0	i am so glad i could see her video on youtube . her voice is amazing !
0	it is just a stupid song . it make absolutely no sense . it is not a song that i like or even really like .

1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this is another song i love to listen to on the radio when i am out and about .
0	this wa a bad song , but it wa actually good .
0	i would buy this album for my 12 year-old . i would buy this album for my 12 year-old . i would pay good money to own this album . i would buy this album for my 12 year-old .
1	i love this song . i always have a cd in mycar , so i can listen to it whenever i need to . the lyricsare very meaningful .
0	this album ha some really good song . there is a few song that are a bit repetitive , but most of the song are pretty good . i guess it is like the beatles say , if you are not happy with one song , then you can forget it . but the three song that are repeat after each other are really good .

1	this is truly the best collection of mozart symphony that i have ever heard . i think it just might be the best collection of mozart symphony that i have ever heard , period .
1	this is the tom wait live recording from the band first full-band concert . this concert wa filmed and later recorded on a tape and sold a a live album , but wa later deemed to be a demo of a live concert recorded at a different venue .
1	dave clark five is one of my favorite group ever , period .
0	i can not believe i wasted money on this . i bought this for my collection . if i had to go back to the store to buy this , i would be going on ebay .
1	it is a good song , but i think it is probably one of the better one on the record .
0	the album ha good song with some different artist in it .

1	my favorite song ever .
1	i know i like her song and i think she ha a good voice .
0	it is a good song , but it is kinda short and repetitive .
1	i love this cd , i have listened to it several time and i am enjoying it ! i am not a fan of e.s . posthumus , however . not by choice , by necessity . i just have to get through the rest of the cd before i start listening to him .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i bought this album at the very last minute , and it wa a pleasant surprise . it is a good album , not what i wa expecting from the artist , but nice .
0	i think the music is good , but i do not know why they changed their sound .
0	i love all the grateful dead cd . i have never had a bad live performance in my life , and i am quite familiar with the dead . the only thing i have not been able to do so far is to buy all the live cd , which are very expensive . i think this is a good selection of dead song , but i would like to know if there is a way to buy the live cd at a lower price .

0	this is a really good album , but i think there is a lot of repetition .
0	i have got the original version of this on itunes , but there is a cover that wa recorded that i would really love to buy .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i did not know tom wait had this song . i liked the first two song . this is a very good song , with great lyric . it is a little raw sounding , but that is to be expected from a tom wait song . it is a song that you can listen to for a long time if you want to . this is a good song , but i would not have chosen it a my first tom wait song .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	the song is just okay , and i really like the rest of the album , but i am not a huge fan of this song .
1	a nice acoustic and quiet , yet fun song . love the harmony .

1	i love this album ! i had forgotten about this album !
1	great cd . i am not a choir person , but i like this cd . i have given it to a group of singer that are not in a choir .
0	what is even worse than the cd is the fact that the same people are selling it , making thousand of dollar . i purchased 3 of these cd . each ha the same thing on it . the same thing is on all 3 cd . they do each have a different name for each cd . i am not impressed with the cd . i will not buy it again . i have tried my best to find a site or other place where i could buy the cd and listen to it in my car . but , no one would sell me the cd . i have tried looking on the internet . but , no one would sell me the cd . i will not buy it again .
1	i wa extremely pleased with the quality of the recording and enjoyed the ease of downloading .
0	i bought this record because i like the song i do not believe . i like it a a song , but a a song for a rock group , i do not think it is played anywhere . i like the album ; i just wish it wa played more .
0	i don ’ t know why this cover suck . it is actually pretty good .
0	i like this version better than the original , but it still sound like a band version . i hear what my friend are saying . it is not a live version , it is a band version .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i like this song . it is very well sung , and i think it is great . i like the song . i like the song . it is a good song . this is a good song . i do not like this song . i do not like this song . i do not even like this song . this is a bad song . this is a very bad song . this is a very bad song . i like this song . this is a good song . this is a good one . this is a good one . this is a good one , and i like it . i like this song . i like this song . i like the song .

1	wow ! barbra streisand is really good . i think the lyric are great too . i wa impressed by how the song start with the first line of the chorus and i am glad she kept it going .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	it is better than the original , with a different arrangement and with better sound quality . this is a great version .
1	one of the most amazing gift i ever recieved . i have had this cd for about a month and finally got it yesterday . it wa in a nice case and i wa so excited to play it . i wa able to play it for about 45 minute and it wa amazing . the song selection is wonderful . the cd is in a nice , clear plastic , which is the best of cd i have ever listened to . i would recommend anyone to get the cd in a nice case .
0	this is a very beautiful song . i especially like the part where the piano play the melody . i have been listening to this song for many year and always enjoy hearing the different version made by different people .
1	it is difficult to say , but from what i understand , this album is pretty good . it is not the best prince but it is ok. i would say if you are looking for something that you can listen to while doing something ( like walking around the house/yard/etc ) this is a good choice .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this song ha always been one of my favorite . i do not think i have ever heard anyone sing this song like this . i have never heard anyone sing this song like this . it is one of my favorite song .
0	just because you like country music doe not mean it is better . do not go out and buy this cd . it is just a bunch of big sounding music that ha no meaning . i know if the song is really good , it will find a way to be played on the radio . but for now , it is just another cd to be bought . i do like this song . but it is just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to . it is just another piece of music that you will buy and never listen to , and i will be the one who sell it .
0	this album wa great . great song with great song .
1	i like this song . the video is pretty good too . it ha a very catchy chorus . i am not sure why it did not get any airplay . it is a very fun song . i am not quite sure what it is about - but i can see why people would like it .
0	i really like this album . it is
0	i like it when people listen to and sing this song , but this song is terrible .
0	the first song is just amazing . the rest of the song are good but nothing outstanding .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	this song is just plain bad . i have no idea why it stayed on the cd .
0	the album wa not what i expected . it had a lot of really good song but i really wish it had been more focused on the song .
0	a very good collection of ornettes best song , and is the best collection of his material yet . the only bad thing is that it took me a long time to get to listen to all of the song . there are only 7 of them and i thought i heard them all . i am very excited to listen to the song . i have the entire collection on cd and cassette and i think i would have been disappointed if i had gotten this collection on cd . i have the cassette . i am trying to figure out how to listen to it without cassette tape , but i think i will just have to sit down and listen to it on cd . i have listened to a few of the song and they are all good .
0	i wa pleasantly surprised by this cd . i wa expecting a lot more than this cd ha . i got to the first song , the sound of music and could not find my voice . i wa afraid that this cd is going to be a waste of my time , and i just wanted to make an honest review . it is a lot of fun . i think it is jewel best cd yet .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this is good trance music . i feel that the melody are a little bit repetitive , but the music is very good and very melodic . i will recommend this to anyone who want to like trance . this is a good album .
0	i got faded for free and it wa horrible . it is so bad , you do not want to listen to it .

1	this song wa a little different than the rest on the album .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	jp is a great guitar player .
1	this is a very good worship album .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	it is not great , but it is not bad . the song are decent for the most part , but the album is anemic , and the production is pretty forgettable .
1	i have never been disappointed with barb
0	i have always preferred mike varneys work over his work with mike v. i wish the mike v album wa more like this one . i do not like the way it is arranged . the ballad are nice , but the song were too long and the guitar playing wa not good .
1	i am very happy with this album . i just bought it . i just bought it for the song . i love it , it is hot and sexy . i love all the song on the album , but i love the video , it is hot and sexy .

1	i love most of r.kellys song .
1	great song .
0	this is my second cd of the day . it is an album of the original tom wait album downtown train . he recorded this album with a great band and this is the best recording of the album . i think it is the best recording of the whole album . in fact , this wa the only tom wait album i ever bought . i just do not understand why they put that stupid label on it . it is not a tom wait album . it is a recording of the original music . tom wait is still there but the name is not on the cover . it is a tom wait record . the album is called downtown train and i would recommend it to anyone who love the music .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i don ` t like the song at all .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	for my son , this is the best cd i have ever heard . he tell me all the time that when i play it to him it make him feel better . i have not yet had the opportunity to have him listen to it , but i will listen to it tonight and i will let you know how it go . thanks for the cd . i really like it .

1	this song is great . you can listen to it on a car radio .

0	the only reason i downloaded this cd wa to listen to the lyric while i wa driving to school . it is a shame that i have to listen to it at school .
0	i love this cd , a a whole . it is a great album and a good introduction to the grateful dead . however , i did not like the fact that the cd ha been damaged . the sound quality is not good . i will not be buying anymore grateful dead cd , and i will not recommend them to anyone . the only good thing about this cd is that the cd is in very good shape . i have listened to this cd over and over again , and it still sound just a good a the day i bought it .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	this song ha a great message about perseverance and going through tough time . the lyric are great and i like the backing melody . the singer doe a good job and the instrumentation is really good .

1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i love this song , i really do . but i think it is a little bit to long and doe not have enough tempo .
0	this album is a good mix of song that i like .
0	i love prince but this album is a disappointment . the song are good but the production is terrible . i am not a fan of prince music . i am going to try to buy this album again or wait for the next prince album , but i do not recommend it .
1	i think her song are great . she can sing a lot of different song and they are all extremely catchy .
0	i wa searching for a fast paced band , and i found this cd to be fast paced and catchy . although the music is very hard to follow , the sound and the lyric are very enjoyable . this is a good cd that i would listen to again .
1	i really enjoy the song . i hope they do more of these type of song .
1	this is a great album . i wa disappointed that i had to listen to the entire disc . this is definitely worth the price of admission . great lyric , great music , great performance . i am looking forward to seeing this band on tour . i have seen them in the past and the crowd wa huge ! i saw them during the first time this band played a stadium tour . that is how the concert wa made to be a big deal . they are still a great , hard working , great band .
0	the song is terrible . it reminds me of a very annoying song .
1	i am not a big fan of tom wait , but this song is great .
0	i have bought this cd and it is amazing . i think it is the greatest cd ever . i would give it a 5. i do not really like the song , but it is the best i have ever heard . i would give it a 2.5 .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i love this song . i can not believe i never thought of it before . i have been listening to it on the radio for year and year . it is great .
1	i wa looking for a song to listen while my wife wa away . i heard this song online while waiting for my wife to get home . i loved the lyric , loved the sound of the acoustic guitar , and absolutely loved the bass line . that is the main reason i bought this cd . i wa so impressed that i bought it a a gift for a friend . i have not listened to it yet , but i will soon .
0	i like this cd , but some song are boring , so i can understand why some people didnt like it .
1	i love jp and this album .
1	this is great and easy to sing along with .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	the song are well played and i really like the way it sound . the only one i do not like is i am waiting . the song are well played .
1	this is the best tom wait cd i have ever heard . i bought the cd hoping that it would be a good song . it is a great song . i bought the cd hoping that it would be a good song and it turned out to have been great . i am a fan of tom wait and i bought tom wait cd hoping that it would be a great song and it turned out to have been great .
1	this cd come from the heart and is a joy to listen to . there is so much music in this album . a nice balance . i love the song , but i like it even more that i like the artist . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i like this song because it is a modern interpretation of the older hymn style . the original hymn style are not that old either . i like the fact that it is not too religious . i also like the fact that the melody is played in a different key from the rest of the song . but i do not like the fact that there is no bass line or the guitar/drum solo .
1	i have always liked this song . i have never heard it played on any record , and i have never heard it on a television show . the song is very beautiful and ha some very beautiful word . it is also one of the song that i feel wa used to advertise the movie .
1	a someone who listened to some of his cd early on , and then again after moving away from him , i can honestly relate . he wa the type of man that if he wa with you , it wa a must
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is a nice album . this album is a nice album that i have listened to for two day now .
1	i love this album ! i love the song and i love playing the album . i love it ! everyone know the first album by tom wait but the second album is very different and better than the first one . the song are very well done and there is lot of instrument in this album . i do not know about the rest of tom wait album but this one is the greatest .
0	i have had this cd for two year , and i have listened to it several time . i am disappointed that some of the song on it are not a good a i thought they would be . i also think the cd is a waste of money .
0	this song is a must have for me . i have been listening to this song for a good while now and i really like it . the lyric are interesting and i like the rhythm . i recommend this song .
0	i am not a fan of any prince . however , i am not disappointed with any album he ha released , and this is certainly one of them . the song are all good , there are many good track including song such a raspberry beret , the most beautiful girl in the world , if i wa your girlfriend , when dove cry , u got it bad , 1999 , jerk it , a little help from my friend , little red corvette , kiss of life and the most beautiful girl in the world .

0	i can listen to this beatles collection for hour .
0	i like this track a lot ! it a great song !
1	i have found amazon customer service to be very good and helpful . i am confident that i will be able to find the cd i want , and get them in good quality . i love the variety that amazon sell . i will continue to shop there .
1	the only thing i would add to this review is that the cd is not a real grateful dead album . it is not really a true grateful dead album . it is just a collection of song that the grateful dead made into a cd back in the 70 . this cd is not a true grateful dead cd . i would like to correct the fact that it is not a “ real ” grateful dead cd here . i wa not a huge fan of the grateful dead until i found out that they were a cover band . i then started listening to the grateful dead , and i found that they were a very good band . i also found that the grateful dead were a very good cover band . they just had enough original music that they were able to make a very good cd . i would like to add that the grateful dead were a very good cover band . they were able to make their cover song into a very good cd . they were not able to make their original song into a very good cd . that is what i mean by “ real ” grateful dead . that is a true grateful dead cd . i would like to add that i also like the new cd that they released called “ the other one. ” that cd is a “ true ” grateful dead cd . i would like to add that i would like to correct the fact that they were a cover band . they were not able to make their original song into a verygood cd . that is what i mean by “ real ” and “ true ” grateful dead . i would like to add that i would like to add that i would like to correct the fact that it is not a “ true ” grateful
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	the dave-clark-five is the first cd i have of the beach boy material . i listened to it before i bought it because i wanted it on cd . i would love to hear it on the radio . this is the best cd i have ever heard , i would reccommend it to all fan of the beach boy .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i hate this song
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	the best cover ever .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i like that the music is different from the other song on the album . i like the fact that it is very positive and uplifting .
1	this program ha some good episode
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	this wa a good song , but i do not get why she is always singing in the same verse .
1	i have been listening to whitney houston for a long time , but i had never heard i wasnt talking about jesus . i have a very strong christian faith and i love the gospel more than anything else , but whitney is so beautiful and i will definitely listen to the gospel song with her .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i think this is a very good album . i just did not like the song . i found the vocal to be a bit weak and i did not like the instrumentation . the song satellite is a good song by the new pornographer , but i am not there is a poor song . i liked the sound of the new pornographer a a group . they have the same sort of sound a the velvet underground , but without the vocal . one day , i hope that they will record a song that is like i am not there but with a better sound . until that time , they were a good band .
0	not his worst .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i like this recording for it sound , but the sound is not clear . the sound quality is poor .
1	this song ha a lot of energy and it is very cool and interesting .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	for me , this is a perfect song . i like that it is a slow ballad , and the fact that it is acoustic is great .
1	this album is amazing

0	this is an early recorded version of a song that never made it to a cd . i think if they had recorded it properly - and have it remastered - this would be a fine piece of music .
0	the cd is called a place among u and the singer is called sidewinder . the song are great : a place among u , the gift of life , the cross , one man and his dream , a message from heaven , seed , the heart of the resurrection , the holy spirit , a place among u ( revival version ) .

0	i wa at a bar the other night and the band wa playing this song . the song wa terrible . i left the bar and went home and listened to it on karaoke . the drummer came back to the bar and said , this is the worst song i have heard in a long time . the worst song i have ever heard in my life . i have never heard a song that bad since i wa in kindergarten ! i did not realize that this song wa a hit until i saw it on the cover of the best of wild cd and i thought , this is one of the good song on the cd . it wa a fun night .

1	i love the sound of this song and i can not believe it is over 30 year old .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

1	this album may not be ohearns best , but it is certainly one of his best . i love the first few song and i love the last few until the end . i find the instrumentation to be very very good . i like the fact that there are many different instrument used . the lyric are very nice and i just do not understand why they do not show up in all of his other album a well . i think this album is very underrated and deserves to be heard .
0	it is just that at this point i am not too excited about this song , so i will just go into the negative . this song is just a little too much for me . too much of a good thing , in fact .
0	i bought this cd a few day ago . i wa expecting something a bit more substantial . oh well , i still have my money !
0	i thought sam sparro wa a rocker but this is far from rock . i am not a big fan of this song .
1	i know , and i know , but i still love it ! i like this album much more than the original . the same with the movie sophies choice . it is a more personal and intimate film . i liked it better than the movie of the bodyguard . i find it more personal and personal with this concert . i just like this album more !
1	this album rock !
0	this is without a doubt one of the worst album ever ! it is not that it is bad , in fact , it is pretty good , that is just the way it is . the worst part is the vocal . i have an idea about what they are doing , but i can not figure out how to explain it , and i do not want to listen to it in it entirety . if you are a musician with ear , you can hear the vocal . if you are not , you will have no idea what they are doing . if you are really a musician who ha ear , you should listen to this record . i would not recommend it to anyone who doe not like music with vocal .

1	i love listening to whitney houston song . i love the voice very much . i love god so much !
1	nice to see old jazz standard performed by new jazz musician . the album ha a familiar feel , but this group is not a traditional jazz group . my favorite track is it might be your love . i like this song because it is a good example of how to perform a ballad . the rest of the album is very good , but i tend to listen to the more complex song . i would recommend this album . it is a great example of a band that is taking jazz to another level .
1	i love the story line of this song . i wa in a car accident . i wasnt supposed to talk about it . instead , i talk about the pain i felt . the song express my pain so well . it is a slow song . you need to slow it down . it is not a song that will get you down . this song is so beautiful . there are not a lot of song like it .

1	have listened to this song so many time i lost count . i love this song . i never knew what he did for a living . i am glad i found it . i do not know why i had never heard of him . this song should get a star . it is a great feel good feeling good song .

1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	another fine album , but the singer sound like a man who ha never sung on any other album , but is trying to sound a bit more manly . i would like to hear a few more track from this album . i am a big fan of the entire album , but this track is the only one i can truly say is worth the download .

0	this is a great prince song . little red corvette is one of my all-time favourite song . i actually went and bought the cd ( with the movie on it ) when the movie came out . this song is great ! the song is well-known by many people , in the late 1970s and maybe even the early 1980s . it wa part of the soundtrack for the movie purple rain . i love this song . you have to listen to the whole album !
1	this cd is a must have for any believer or non-believer . you will not be disappointed . if you have never heard of this artist , check out his cd let the music play . it is a great cd . if you are happy with this cd it is a must have . if you do not , it is a waste of money . it is a good christian cd . if you have never heard of this artist , check out his record let the music play and let the music play .
0	i purchased this album because i had heard good thing about it and then i heard these two song and i wa immediately disappointed . it wa so boring , i could barely get through it . i have never heard anything like it . i wa listening to this album while trying to write this review . the song the weight of your love is a very sad song . it is very slow and seems to be about a relationship breakup . it is depressing . the weight of your love is very depressing . the song i will be your mirror is about losing a loved one .
1	the song is very catchy and beautiful . it is a very good song . this is a good one . this is a very good song . this is a good song . this is a very good one . this is a great one . this is a very good one . this is a good song . this

0	this is the best of that era . i prefer it to that era . this is the one i love . - david lee roth
0	this is a good song , but not the type of music i listen to . this is a fun song , but not the type of music that i listen to .
1	i remember tom scott from his day a a member of the count basie orchestra . he also played with chick corea . i think he is one of the most talented pianist in jazz and ha continued to evolve a an artist . i do not know how he ha stuck around this long . the album is a tribute to his early year in the count basie orchestra .
1	very , very good recording . very nice voice and quality , very nice recording .
0	i bought this album for my wife and it is great ! the song are very well written and well played . i have listened to this cd several of time now and have really enjoyed it .
0	i have downloaded this song to listen at home , and i love it . it good music , im suprised to have never heard of it before .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i love this album !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is a pretty good cd , but is not my favorite of hers . the music is not very well known , and i can not imagine anyone wanting to hear this music . it is just not that good .
0	i have to say i wa a little disappointed in this christmas release . i had been a little upset that it did not have all the vocal of the original . i wa glad to hear that there were some different vocal on this cd . i wa disappointed however with the lyric and the pronunciation . it wa fine but i wa wishing it wa more like the original . i am glad that the singer/singer did not sound like the original . thank you marie for keeping the original tradition alive .
0	i love this album too , but i thought it wa a little slow on the album for me . i wish the song were a little more energetic . but , it is not bad . overall , i love the album . i think the song are great and it is a very good album .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i think this album is a bit of an acquired taste . i do not think it is one of the great but it can still be enjoyable .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i really like her singing . i like her even more now that i know she is a singer .
1	this is the best song on this album . it the only song i listen to on this album . it sound funny , but it the funniest song i have ever heard . i love it . i wish i could sing like that .
0	this is a great song , the guitar part is awesome and the harmony are awesome . the lyric are lame , the song just go on and on . very disappointed that they changed the lyric .
0	do not know . i like the music and the video . i like all of the music and all of the video .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	it is a great version , but i do not like the movie version .
0	i think becky is right , it sound like a 12 year old playing a guitar . i mean what are they doing ? they obviously do not know what a guitar is . it is not like they are doing a cover of the edge but rather jvj . it is not the best of the gnr cover , but it is not bad .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this is the most complete recording of the work of george gershwin . this is a wonderful set with a wonderful performance by the great classical pianist michael tilson thomas .
0	i have never heard barbra streisand live , but i have only listened to her record and cd . this is a very good song , but the lyric are not so good .
1	i listened to this album on my drive home . i like most of the song
0	brandy is soooooo good . it is a song i listen to all day long .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i got this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading song from amazon . the song on itunes are good but the song on amazon are good .
1	i think that this album will have a major impact on the music that we all listen to and i wa really surprised at how good this album is . i thought that this album wa going to be a horrible album , but it turned out to be a really good album . i am glad that i listened to this album , it is a good album worth listening to , you just have to know what you are listening to .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !

1	this a great song . i really like the background vocal and how it sound with the guitar and drum going

1	this is a very good song . love it !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .

0	this song just doe not seem to fit with him .
1	this is the best cover of the original version . the original version is better , but this is the single most beautiful cover of the original version . the original is better , but this one is absolutely beautiful . if you do not like the original , go buy the original or any gn r album to hear this cover .

0	i have a problem ; i love this band . i have seen them in a concert and they are amazing .
0	i have been a fan of this song since i first heard it on the radio back in the early 2000s . i believe i first heard it on one of those old nickelodeon program . that is the only version i have been able to find at the end of the song . i love the song . i love the lyric too . i love the video too . i love the whole album too . i can not help but think that the candy coated love in the song is the main reason i like this song .
0	i love her music . her music ha given me a lot of joy .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	lareine is a really good song .
1	it is an old-time song with a modern beat . this song is catchy and fun to sing to . it is a good song that i am sure i will listen too on the album .

1	i like this album .
0	this song get on my nerve .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i like this song , and i do not like the version that is currently playing everywhere else , but i have not heard the original . i like this version better than the version with the way you look tonight that is playing everywhere else . i like the sound of this song better than the song .
1	love this band , and all their song
0	the song selection is decent . i like most of the song . the production is good . the production is not good . the music is terrible . the song selection is very poor . all of the song are about sex in a very low voice . they are very annoying when you are trying to sleep or trying to relax . i do not know if they think that is a sex song or just a rock song . they sound like the first few second of a porno movie . i am not sure why they even put this cd out . i feel like they are trying to get some money by selling these horrible song . this is the second cd that i have listened to because they sent this out . i will not buy it again . i hope they do not put any more out . i will probably be buying a dvd .
1	this is not that bad , i do not like it but it is not bad . it ha good beat and she is a great singer .

1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i bought this album
1	i like barbra streisand and i think she is really good . the song is good and i do not know why anyone would change the lyric , but it is a great song . i like the song , but i do not know if it is a hit song .
1	this is the best piece of tape i have ever heard ! it is the best music i have ever heard ! a friend of mine bought this tape and we put it on in the car and it wa the best thing i have ever heard in my life ! great singing !
1	tom wait is a legend . he is a wonderful singer and musician . he can do it all . there is nothing he can not do . he is the real deal . he is the king of rock n roll . from the velvet underground to the door to bob dylan , tom wait ha been doing it all . i am not just talking about his music . i am talking about his personal life . he wa married to a real hot chick and they lived in the mountain of new york . tom wait ha been married for 38 year . i am sure he ha a great wife and two great kid . i am sure he is a great dad and a great husband . he is an amazing artist and a great man . i love him and all the other great artist . i am sorry that he is no longer a legend in rock . i hope he come back . i love him .
0	this song ha some great lyric and amazing melody . i like it . but , i have to admit , i do not know the word . i wa hoping for better .
0	if you are into this type of music , you probably like this one . if you like classic 60 rock , this is a must have . the guitar riff are fun and a great way to start your day . i do not know how much i have to complain about this , but i am really tired of this cd .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	it is mp3 download . the product wa exactly what wa advertised . once again , i did not receive what wa advertised .
1	this album is worth it if you are a fan of the late 80 .
1	this is a great cd , a i said , i have heard all the cd version of this movie , and they are all the same , it is annoying , but not a annoying a the movie
1	a great live performance with great vocal .
0	i bought this because i loved the dave clark five . i think this is the best song on the tape . i do not know who sang it , but i like it . i do not like it , but i like the dave clark five .
1	this is the second song on the album . i have purchased this song . i like it , i just do not know why people do not like it . i also like the song . i like the song , and i know people will like it .
1	i like this song . i bought the cd thinking it would be a good song to listen to during the commute . but , when i started listening to it , i realized it wa a wonderful song . ( you know , sometimes i listen to song that i think i like but then i hear the same thing over and over . ) i like the part about the bird that come into the yard . it is a beautiful song . i like how i can picture the scene in my mind . the song is very long , but you can hear it in just a few minute .
1	this song is one of my favorite . it will always be my song .
0	i think her singing is very good ; the only thing i do not like is the fact that you can not hear the lyric while the song is playing .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	the best album by bonnie . she is one of the best singer in the game .
1	a great album . a wonderful collection of song , very enjoyable . i would recommend this album if you are looking for a good , well put together album with great song and great playing . it will not disappoint .
0	this album wa not my favorite , but it wa on my list of most important album of 1990 .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this song suck .
1	i really like this song , but the beginning is repetitive and boring .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	the best album i have ever heard . i like it for all of the reason why i love it .
1	i have a hard time getting around this bonnie tatum cd . it is so beautiful and i love it . the song are great and so is the voice of the artist . the voice is so great , it is very beautiful .
1	this song reminds me of my childhood . i love this song because it make me think about my family , my friend , and being a young adult . this song ha really been a constant that ha been a part of my life for so long . i hope everyone ha a great day and is safe .
0	the best album .
1	i love bonnie . she is a great singer and she ha a wonderful voice . you can tell she love to sing . she is a very warm and talented person . i love the way she sings and i love the lyric . i like that she put a lot of herself into the song .
1	these guy ( kurt vile and the violator ) had a hit song called american girl and i wa fascinated by the idea of a woman who had to go to college . i always thought the song wa a little too sappy for me , but i thought i would give them a try . i purchased their debut album in a small store in the mall in the town where i lived . the store owner told me to call him if i had any problem with the cd . i thought they were great , so i called the store . he told me that he had already received the cd and there were no problem . i made sure to listen to them and decided that they were pretty great . i think this is one of the top five album i have ever purchased . it ha a lot of good song and is very enjoyable .
0	it is good , but i can not understand the lyric .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i just bought a touch of grey . i have been searching for a good song to listen to at the end of my day . this is it . i will now be able to relax and go on with my day .
0	i wa very excited to receive this cd in the mail . i am a huge fan of jewel , and i wa glad to see her back . i wa a little disappointed that it sounded like it wa recorded at a very high volume , especially the last two song . i know i am not a very good judge of music , but i feel that the quality of the music on this cd wa a little much . i would have liked to hear her playing the guitar again , and i wa hoping for another live show , but this wa disappointing .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i am glad to hear that a fan finally gave this album a review . i will be listening to this album again in a few month .

1	i listen to this cd while driving and i can not hear the song over the radio . i am not sure if that is just because i have bad hearing or if it is something else .

1	this is the best song barbra ha ever done .
1	my favorite song on the cd is take your time it is a very nice song to listen to when you are waiting for a bus .
1	just a thought . it would be a good idea to get the lyric to this song . it is a little bit sappy and not at all clever . it would be a great way to learn about the lyric and the song and not get lost in the song .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this song ha been a staple of the live show for year . it wa one i played for year at my local club .
0	the song wa on the back of the cd , it wa not in the booklet . i would not recommend this .
1	not a big fan of this type of music , i like some rock , and i like some blue , but i am not a fan of his music . i have heard a couple of his song and i can not say that they are any good . i wish that he would stop writing and singing about how he love her etc . he is not the first . i like other singer who write song about how they love someone . he is not a fan .
1	if you like bob dylan , this is a must listen . it is a good song , but i think it is a bit different from all other song that bob dylan ha written to date . for some reason , i like it .

1	i wa looking for a country cd to enjoy while watching football . i came across this one , it is very good . a good way to unwind after a long day .
1	the best thing about this album is that it is one of the best-sounding and best sounding album of all time .
1	i really like this album . i really like the vocal on this album and the song . the only problem i have with this album is the song are all short . i do not mind short song , but these are very brief . i wish they would make more album like this one . i am glad i bought this album . i would buy this album again , maybe the next time i order a cd .
0	wanya is a very talented songwriter whose tune are a fresh a his mind . this one is a great example . like many of his song , it is a mixture of soul , funk and r & b. the melody is very simple and yet very memorable . it ha a great beat , great lyric and great instrumentation . i love it !
0	i like this . i am not sure what i like about it . it a good song . this guy is not a great singer but he ha a strong voice . i like the lyric and i like the song . i do not like the recording .
1	music is like a drug .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this cd is a good piece of music , but it is just way too long for a holiday gift . we all know that christmas is a time for giving , but i am not sure that this particular gift is doing much for the cause . i have always thought that it is better to give a gift that is unique , that add something new to the household , than to give one that is just a duplicate of something someone else ha already received .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is the best indie rock album that i have heard in a long time ! if you have not heard this album , listen to it , and you will be hooked !
1	i like the lyric on this song .
0	i love the song on this album . it is a classic .
0	a very good song .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	a good album - the only problem is that it doe not really stand up to the rest of her material that i have heard . it is not a bad album in any way , but it is not the best .
0	i have been listening to this album for almost 4 hour . it is a very good album . and , i really enjoy it .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	it is not just one of those album , it is one of the best rock album ever made . i love the grunge music of the period-the new wave , the post grunge-the stuff where band like nirvana and sonic youth are still relevant . i do not hate grunge and i do not hate anything new , it is all just music and music is good .
1	i loved the song and loved the video .
1	this is excellent . i have yet to hear better quality trance music .
0	this album is a great album but i do not think it is going to be on the top of my list .
1	this is one song i listen to while driving to and from work .
0	i have no one to blame but myself for not remembering this song , and now i wish i could . i can not say i really like it but i can understand why it wa popular .
0	i like artpop . i have listened to this band for many year . they are a good band . this is their second album . i am waiting for the third album . it is great . it is great . it is great . it is great !
0	karajan wa a huge star in his day and the man music continues to be played on the radio today , but i have to say that this cd is not karajans best . the music is fine , but the production is a bit low in the mix and the vocal are often a bit muddled . perhaps if the music wa better recorded , the singing would be good .
0	good lyric and great music for a 3-7 year old child who love music and singing .
1	if you like the movie , then this song is perfect for you to sing . it is just the way it is supposed to be sung . i would recommend everyone to buy the cd . if you are a fan of the movie , then this song is perfect for you .
1	this is a good country cd . i bought it because it is a country cd . i did not buy it to listen to it , i bought it because i like country music .
1	i do not know what this album is about , but i like it a lot . i think it is the best worship album that i have ever heard . it ha a nice mix of old worship song with new worship song . the song are really beautiful and it ha a nice mix of different style . i like the song i can not wait and keep praising the best . i like the band a lot
1	i had to send this to all my friend and family . i have never heard this song . it is so beautiful . i am sure i will never hear it again . i am still waiting for the cd . this is one of my favorite . i give this 5 star .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i love this album , but i do not understand why everyone hate it . it is not what i expected but i love it , and the most hated part is the music . the only thing i dislike about this album is that it is so short - 10 song long . i can not understand why so many people hate this album . this is probably my favorite ohearn album .
0	i am pretty sure that this is a cover of if i fell . this is not a great song , but it is a very good song .

1	this is a great song . i love it .
0	it is a very good album , but the lyric are very offensive .
1	this is dave clark 5 at it is best . i have been a fan of this band since the 80 . the music is very intricate and ha a very distinctive sound . i have always been able to identify the song easily when i hear the same one played live . i hope to one day see the dave clark 5 again .
1	my boyfriend got the album for me . i thought it wa really good .
1	i just bought this cd . it sound like a great country album .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	it is an oldie , but i liked the track . it is a good song to dance to .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .

0	i love the music on this album , and i love the production . i am a fan of prince and i feel he is done very well since he is been in the spotlight .
1	this is a very popular song . it wa a favorite of elvis daughter , who recorded it for the soundtrack of the movie blue hawaii . it wa a hit for johnny mathis . it wa a major hit for billy joel , and for the beatles . this is a very popular song .
1	in the 60 they were the best , and they are still the best and the best . i hope that this is the last cd they do . i have over 30,000 cd , and i have a lot of dead music . i hope that this is the last cd they do , because i would rather listen to them then anything else .

0	the best album in the history of popular music . the only thing lacking from this set is a vocal version of a nightingale sang in berkeley square but if that is your cup of tea , this album is well worth the $ 20 .

0	there are a lot of song that could come from the velvet underground ( song for drella ) and this is one of them . i could go on and on about the i am feeling lucky and i can not live without you and the i am so happy i can not stand it and the i want to be with you but i will save that for another time . this song is so bad it is good .
0	this cd play for only a few second and then pause and start over . it is wa a waste of my money .

1	i bought one of these cd for my wife . she wa surprised and loved it . i wish i could buy more . i like the cd that come with it .
1	when i received this album i wa skeptical . however i listened to it and found it to be very good .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this album is a great cover . i love that the song is taken off the original . the harmony and lyric are great . it is a great album . the album cover is not worth the $ 17.99 i spent on it .
0	it is good , but the sound quality is not good .
0	this is my favorite song on the album !
1	great album . really , really nice album . very nice vocal . love her singing voice . i also like the way she play the piano . i can not decide which is my favorite part of the album . i like the song , i am in love with you , but i do not know what to do . i think she is in the middle of a ballad , and also the ballad is going in the wrong direction .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is a very good example of a simple song . there are a couple of problem i have noticed though . i have noticed that the song doe not have a chord progression . the song is also a little repetitive . i will be adding to the song a i go . i like the simplicity of it . i think that i will have to write down a few more song to make it a good a it is . it is a very simple song that ha a good melody and lyric . i hope to have a few more song to add to the site very soon .

1	i have been searching for year to find a dave clark five album , and finally i got it
0	when i first heard this song , i thought it wa great . it wa fast and i like fast music . just when i thought i like it , the singer went into a deep voice that reminded me of the voice of a child . then the voice changed to a deeper deeper voice and i thought the song wa over . it sounded like someone wa singing in a church . but then it got better . that second part wa the best part . the rest of the song wa good but after that , i did not like the song anymore .
1	this is one of the few song that i like . the other song i like are all my loving by bonnie tyler and i have always been crazy by elvis presley . i feel a though this song is not a good a them . it is hard to write a song when it is too easy . that is why i wrote this song . it is a very difficult song to sing and i am very glad that i wrote this song .
1	i love this song !
1	this album is not bad . but there are a few song that are better . not sure what the problem is with this album .

0	this is the best cd i have ever bought .
0	the opening guitar riff on a different world is phenomenal . i just wish that more band would use the guitar riff a an introduction to the song rather than a middle section . if this song had a chorus it would be amazing . it is good , but ,
0	this is not the best album ever , but it is enjoyable because the song is catchy and different from other artist . i would give it 4 star but the song is a little different from the uptown funk song .
0	this is a very bad song . it is extremely irritating . i can not believe the negative review .
1	this song brings back memory of when i wa a teenager and my friend and i would play this song in the car and it would make me feel all happy and free . it is the song that defines my life and life .

1	my first experience of jeff buckley in person wa at the reading festival in england in 1986. he wa the musical guest for the evening . he played a short set , followed by a long one . it wa quite a contrast , and i have never been able to separate buckleys playing from the other musician around him . the set list wa mostly from his early album , so at time it wa like seeing the first time all over again . the other band wa the duke of stratosphear , and they were really interesting , but i would not call them one of my favourite , just one of those band that i enjoyed listening to that i like . buckley wa much better than that , and it wa a very special evening .
0	the cd player will not play the cd . the cd is in a separate box with the cd player .
0	a great and beautiful song . the movie version wa inferior .
1	i love the way the lyric have the melody in the background . i like to sing along with this song .

0	i have bought many album on amazon and never had any problem with the shipping , or the quality of the music . this time i have to say i wa very disappointed . i ordered this cd from amazon . it is a cd with an 8 disc compilation . there are 4 cd in total - and all 4 cd have the same music on them . the only difference of any kind is that one cd is a compilation ( all song performed by the same artist ) and the other 4 cd are all by different artist . the cd with all the song by the same artist is called classic . i ordered this cd and it say it ha a cd of all the song by the same artist , but i just do not recall getting this cd . i do not remember ever buying this cd . the only cd i have ever bought on amazon that i remember were cd of the same artist . i also ordered the cd that came with this cd - it wa a cd of a concert . the concert wa for the artist x. i do not remember if i bought this cd . i do not remember when the concert wa . i should probably go back and check the cd i bought on amazon . but i am sure the cd i bought all had the same artist in them . if i had to go by the description or the cd cover , i would say it is false advertising . i can not remember ever buying this . it certainly is not a cd i would have remembered buying if i had purchased this .
0	what more could i say about this song ? i love it . it is true , it is pure , the beat is perfect and the lyric are just awesome . i love the way the melody flow through the verse and the chorus and the way it roll into the chorus . this is one of my favorite song of all time .

1	this album is just a good a the first album . i like it more because of the more accessible sound . the lyric are kind of funny , and the vocal are good . i like it better than the first album because of the le complex production . the only thing that wa a little disappointing about the album wa the music is kind of average . i did not really like any of the song . all i did wa put the cd in and turned it up . it sound really good , but i do not really care for the music on this cd .

0	at least it ha a nice guitar solo . this is a dave clark five song . i like the dave clark five . i do not know them , but i like their music .
1	this song reminds me of something i had heard year ago . i am not sure what . i have no idea . i am not sure if it wa a band or a pop group . but i thought it wa a great song . i am not sure if it wa a commercial or a demo . but i will never forget what i heard . i hope that there is a song of this song on a cd or a cassette tape somewhere .
0	i have been listening to this song for a while now , and i love it . there are a few part that i wish were longer , but when i listen to it over and over , i can not help but enjoy it . i have been told this song is similar to the weight by sam sparro , and it is . i only wish sparro had released this song , it would have been a perfect double-album . if you like sam sparro , then you will love this .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i bought this cd for my 10 year old son . i just learned about it from him and he love it . i do not know what i would have done without this cd .

1	i love this song . it is my favorite so far , and i like it .
0	this is an album i have been looking for for year . i wish i found this before jon lord and his band had to record their next album . the last album they recorded wa the best album they have ever done . this is a great album . but listen to the first track , you will understand why .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i am going to take a moment to let this guy know he should get a life . he is a very talented artist and doe not deserve to have a record company waste their time on something so badly written and sung .
1	i love the song it is a very powerful song , very well done .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i do not really know what to say about this album . i do not know why people do not like it . i am not really sure what it is about this album . it is a bit of a puzzle but i think it is a classic . i wa hoping for a better recording of the album , but i guess that wa not to be .
1	this is for the people who tell me i can not do anything and that i will never be successful . i am a failure because i believe in myself & i am a woman of color . i am a failure because i am woman & i have a voice . i am a failure because i am a black woman . but if i am not a black woman then i will be a failur . this song is a perfect encapsulation of the struggle we all go through , trying to find our true voice & our true voice for who we are .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i have been a fan of lorde since i got into her . i think she is great , but her music sometimes doe not connect with me . this song is one of them .
0	these musician can play a great guitar lick just like he doe and his voice is perfect .
1	i have listened to many version of this song , and this one is by far the best ! this is a song that is very difficult to put into word , and i hope you enjoy this performance .

1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	this album wa so good , i could not stop listening to it . in my opinion , they are the real deal . the only band i have ever seen them in concert that is able to keep up with them . i have a hard time believing that any other band would be able to do what they do . i have been buying them since i first heard them . i do not think they will stop recording and performing . i wish i could live in that time . this album will stay in my top 3 in term of greatest album of all time . this is the best album so far with any band . i am a huge fan and will never stop listening to them . i have seen them several time and each concert is a different experience . they are still going strong and have new music on the way .
1	i love this album . she sings with a great range and it is very well done . the lyric are a little different , but i really like them .
1	a great prince album . i wa hoping for another hit , but no , this album wa a hit . this album is great music and great vocal .
1	this is my favorite album of john . i had seen him in concert and wa able to talk to him for a year before he died and i met him . i had heard his music for year . i wa a huge fan of tom scott and would love to learn more of his music . i hope to buy more cd by him in the future .
0	this is an excellent review . i wish i had written this for the first album . i have listened to everything since then and the cd is one of my favorite . i would not change a thing . in a few short month , i have learned to recognize and appreciate all the music she ha written and recorded . i would not change a thing . she is a truly wonderful singer . i can not imagine putting this cd on any other label .
1	i love it . the original album is definitely the best .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i love this album ! it my favorite so far , and it ha been for a while . it amazing ! i have been listening to a lot of the same music , but this album is a lot better , and there not an album ive heard that blow it out of the water . if you love her music , you will love this album .
0	this song is a little bit out of my comfort zone . i do not know if i am going to like it . i do not know how long it will take for me to like it . i will probably listen to it for a while and then throw it away .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	it is good , i like the new stuff .
1	i love that song .
0	i really liked this album , and the song is so bad that i would not want to have it in my car .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i have been a fan of whitney houston and mariah carey for a while now , and i am so happy to hear the song , i will always love you . it is so beautiful ! the lyric are beautiful and heartfelt . i really love it . i wa so sad when the supremes died . i thought that they were such a great pop group . i love their song , i will always love you . i am glad they are still singing . i wish they could still be around for me to hear . i am glad that they are still on tour . i would love to see them on stage again .
0	i wa disappointed . the rhythm is uninspired and too slow . the singing is weak . i do not like the song at all .
1	i love this whole album ! i am not really into r & b music and this is one of my favorite r & b album of all time . the song are very entertaining and i love the video !
0	i love this album .
0	i have found that the r & b genre is not dead . there are some great artist out there who will be releasing some excellent music regardless of the genre being used . i do not think the r & b genre will die just yet .

0	i agree with the other member here . i do not like this album at all . the song are good , the lyric are well thought out , and i like the group , but the music is just not memorable . i love the band , but this album just doe not make me want to listen to it .
0	i do not like the fact that this song is so short . it doe not even last long enough to make it worth listening to . the lyric are not that funny/interesting . i like how different it is to see the girl in a music video . i like the fact that it is a rock song . i do not like the fact that it is the same song over and over .
0	this song make me listen to the music , but the video is not very good .
0	i just bought this album , just for the sweetest part of it . i am not very familiar with prince , so i listened to it just to see if i could figure out anything of the song . i wa not very impressed , but it is a good album .
0	i have to give this one a pas because i can not really get into it . but , i can say that i have been listening to it a lot . i think there wa a reason this song wa the first one on the album and i just do not think it is a good reason .
0	the song is great but the video is so ugly .
0	loved this album . it wa one of those album where i went in expecting to love it , but i did not . i do not understand why i am getting this album on the same day a the new one . i did not like it at all . i really wanted to like it , but it just wasnt for me .
1	i hope this song is a hit , and i hope it becomes even bigger than the way we were . i like it , but i do not know if it is a hit song . i do not know if itll ever be a hit , but i hope it doe .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

0	the song is a powerful song about the triumph of faith . the lyric are a little long for a 7 minute song , but it is a good song for the christian , who longs for god to be his strength and guide .
1	i love perry comos music . i have been collecting his album since he wa in his teen . this is my all time favorite christmas album . i love this album and wish him well . perry como is a true artist . he sings and writes his own music . he writes for himself and not for other people .

0	i have had this song on my mp3 player since i wa 10 year old . i remember hearing the song on tv and it had a really unique tune that i sang along with my mom . i loved it . i think it is one of the best song from a band that i have ever heard . i have heard this song on the radio and the radio station always change the song from time to time . so i think it is a good song . it is not a bad song . the song is very nice . i really like the production of this song . i hope everyone enjoys this song . i like this song alot . it is not an easy song to listen to though . it is a really good song . i really love the lyric on this song . i love the lyric on this song . i love the song . i love this song . i really like this song . i love this song . i really like this song and i am glad people liked the song .

1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	very good , one of the greatest song ever written .
1	i am a big fan of this song . it is beautiful .
1	i listen to a lot of music , but i have never heard of this album . i am surprised by the quality and the number of great song . the lyric are really clever . i love the different style of music ! this album is worth the money . i love the recording quality and the sound of the vinyl .
1	this cover is one of the better one . i really like it . it is from the movie the rocky horror picture show .
1	i wa a bit confused when i first started listening to this cd , i thought that wa the only song on it . i decided to give it another chance and listen to the whole cd . i wa blown away by the lyric and the music . this song really touched me . i am glad i had the courage to give this cd another try .

0	the song wa actually written by gary moore , but he wasnt able to get a record deal with the label , so they had a local artist perform the song instead . this guy performed it at the last show , and it wa a hit . so the song wa rerecorded . the song ha been released on many album , but no matter what you do , this song will never be a good a it wa when it wa first recorded . to be fair , the band had a great song , and this is one of their weaker recording .
1	this album is the best album i have ever heard , and it is a must have !
1	this song ha a great tempo . i like it .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i listen to my radio station everyday , and they play these song over and over . i did not like this album when i first heard it , but now i feel like i really did love it , but i did not know it . i do not know why i did not like it when i first heard , but now i am glad i did not like it . i do like it , but i do not like it .
1	this is a good cd by a real great band . i would buy this again .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i love the song ! i love this song . i love this song ! i love this song !
0	this is a very boring song .
1	we are not your friend , we are not your neighbor , we never have been , and we never will be . i do not know who said it , but i love it . it is a very good album . the music is always good . the song are all different and they are all good .
0	it is not the version i heard when . sound different and dissapointing .
1	i love this song and i love this version . this is a great rendition of this song .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	some great song , but they are all from the 60 . dave clark is also doing a tribute to his fellow beach boy with some great song . it is a great cd . i purchased it a few month back and i am still amazed that it wa released on cd . but , this is the first cd i have purchased at amazon that i knew i wa getting a good cd that i wa going to like .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	not my favourite lorde song . but it is ok. i like the song . good song .

1	i really like dave clark five .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this is one of the most promising band i have heard . i love the song they are writing . they have a great talent for playing rock and roll .
1	i never listened to tom wait before but i found this album and i love it ! i have listened to this album so many time , i have found several song i do not remember the title of . i think they are all good .
1	i love love love this song and i like it a lot .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this song wa created by a man named john mark and it is a fun song .
1	this is a song i downloaded for my friend for a party . they loved it ! it is a really nice song , but . it is not very funny or anything .
0	this is by no mean a good recording . the sound quality is poor and the lyric are poor .
0	i thought this song wa really good . i liked the song , and i liked the music , but i think the lyric need a lot of work .
0	this album of bruno mar is unbelievable ! i have never heard this song before , but i love it !
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i have listened to this album several time and i think it is a masterpiece . i have really enjoyed this album . it is a beautiful collection of song . the album is all together and it is very easy to listen to .
0	i love this song ! the reason i do not like it is because the song is repetitive . i love it but i like the song more .
1	i love all the song on this album , but this song is right up there with the best . i love the clean version , but i also like the other version .
0	this song is fantastic !
0	i love tom wait . i love this song . i love his music . i love his voice . he sings great . he ha an amazing voice . i love him .
0	this is a very good album , but the lyric are offensive .
1	this is another great song from the movie tootsie . they did a great job on this movie .
1	i had some great record by jewel back in the day , and i loved her album . i thought she would eventually become a bit more commercial , but i wa wrong . this is a great album . it is a great addition to her catalog .
0	it is a very nice song , but it is very hard to listen to .
1	this is excellent . this is another one of the best steve morse recording . i have listened to this song a lot . the last time i listened to this song , i wa in pain and physically unable to play the organ . i wa able to listen , but not play . this album is the best of the best of the late steve morse recording . steve morse is one of a kind . this is a must have for any hammond fan .
1	i love to sing and dance to this song .
0	i have waited a long time to hear this band new cd . the music is very good . the lyric are great . the production is great . i love the message on this cd . it is a great cd . i hope you all enjoy the music . i love this cd . it is a great cd . i hope the song are really good . i want to own this cd .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	this album is great ! i had the cd for year , but finally went broke . i wa able to get a copy of it , & now i am back to listening to it regularly . i love the album . i do not have it on my ipod , & can not find it on the itunes store . please get it to me .

1	i have been a fan of the band since i had heard them on the radio . i would love to hear more song from this album .
0	this is an excellent song . this is a very good song . i really enjoy listening to this song .
0	i have listened to this cd a lot and love the message in it . i even like the song on this cd . but i hate how much the song cut off at the end of the song . the song is short . it is not a song that one can really get through . the people that i play this cd for do not like it either .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i wa listening to this song and wa thinking to myself how the hell do these two get together to make a masterpiece like this ? there is nothing wrong with the song . like i said it ha everything you want in a song .
1	bonnies voice is fabulous . love this album . love the song .
1	this song reminds me of when i wa little . i will listen to it and sing it with my daughter

1	this cd is a nice choice of music to listen to . the only thing i do not like is the fact that it play so many time . but that is just my opinion . i do not think it would take much to fix that .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this is a great album for lover of classic , melodic trance . it is also a great album for lover of good music . if you like classic , melodic trance and have a good ear . you should own this album .
0	the lyric of this album are very clever
1	this song wa amazing . i love it . i used to listen to this song when i wa a little girl . i loved it .

0	this is the worst album cover i have ever seen . the original song had a lot of meaning , but this cover doe not do it justice . there are two song on here , one called the end and the other which doe not really matter , st. louis blue . the first song really is the best , but the latter is not to my taste . it sound like a 12 year old girl who can not be more than 23. and the song st. louis blue sound like a country song . and i do not like country song .
0	this jon lord album is a great album . i like the first half of the album much more than the second half of the album . the first half of the album is very good , the second half is good a well . i like the album .

1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i have listened to this cd so many time i have lost count . each time i listen to james taylor i get a little bit different and it just keep me coming back . the first time i heard i do not know i knew it would be one of the great song of all time .
0	i love this guy , and i am looking forward to his next record . he ha a great voice .
0	i am sick of hearing about this band . i love their music . i love the grateful dead but this is another level of bullshit . i can not listen to this shit for a month . please stop putting this crap on amazon . you are giving me nothing but an excuse to buy your shit even though i do not want to buy it . i just want to buy your music .
1	this album is a great album , but i do not understand why they have changed the band . the

0	i have been a fan of miley cyrus since her 1st album and i have been patiently waiting for this cd . it is not here yet . this cd should have come out last year . i have already pre-ordered it . i heard the cd during the tour .
1	this song can not get any better .
0	i do not think i like her music much . it is not a good voice . i do not really like her style . i think she is good though , the album ha a good sound . i really like her voice . she is very talented , but doe not get enough credit . it is just a shame that she ha to change her style all the time . maybe she should look at other style and just stay in one . i do not really like the song i am listening to . i do not think i want to listen to another song by her . i do not really like her music . the album is good though . i do not think she can sing but she ha a good voice . i do not like her at all . she is just weird . she ha a very nice voice but she doe not use it correctly most of the time . i like the album though . it is good . it is very good . i like the song and i like the story , it is not bad . i think it wa very good . i am glad to get an album by her . i will listen to her for year .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i love this song ! i love the song . i love this song and i am going to buy it . i love this song ! i love this song ! i love the song . i love your song !
1	i love this band and the song play really good .
0	this music is more interesting than the usual pop tune . i like the vocal , but i think the rest of the track are a bit bland . i like the sound quality . i would have ordered this cd if i had the money .
1	it is called the rocky horror picture show so i am sure it is going to sound pretty good . i have not listened to it yet , but i heard it on the radio and it sounded like a good song .
0	this song is the best song i have ever heard . i love that it is an old classic . i really like that it is got a good beat , but the ending is annoying .
0	this cd is not bad . it is not great . it is mediocre . the cd is an unmitigated dud . it ha no redeeming value . the cd is the worst i have ever heard , and that includes all of the terrible cd ( i mean , for real ! i have never heard a real bad cd . ) it is mediocre . the song are terrible . the music is terrible . the music is the worst i have ever heard . it is worse than the rodeo song ( i do not even know what that is . )
0	this cd is a great cd !
1	i think this is an okay song . the song is pretty good , and the singer is good . it is well written , and the drumming and the harmonica work well . it is not really a bad song , but it is not my favorite .

1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	i wa just getting into elvis presley and so i wa pretty excited about this album . i wa happy to see that he wa still alive and making music . i did not like his music at all , and i really hope he dy soon . the music is good , but i do not think it is worth the $ 14.95 . i will probably not purchase it again .
1	i wa not familiar with hasselvanders music when i ordered this album . i really liked it , especially the song on the first side . i thought the sound wa good . the lyric were well thought out . i would recommend hasselvanders music to people who like music of the 60 and 70 with a little bit of the sound of the 70 .
0	i do not know how many time i have listened to this album and i still have not gotten over the fact that it wa the wrong album .
0	it is barbra streisand singing the way we were and it is very good . i like the song , but i do not think i would love it .

1	i have watched tom wait perform several time and i wa amazed at how he sang . i have been to numerous concert and several time
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i am disappointed that this cd ha no music credit . i wa hoping for a song with a melody or something like that .

0	i have been a fan of this song from the movie the notebook . i love it and i like it a lot ! it is not the same song from the movie . it is not the same song on the movie . i downloaded it to my phone and it is still not fully downloaded . it wa a waste of my money .

0	the song is great , but i would rather have a song with a different theme . it is not bad , but i would rather have a song with more lyric .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	great tune ! great recording . great music . amazing quality ! this is by far the best recording of this song . i could have played the entire 9th in just a few second , but i did not . i simply took a few note and played them back . i hope this review doe not offend anyone .

0	i love her first two album , but i can not give this one a higher rating . the song are pretty , but the lyric are terrible . i would buy the album , but i do not think it is worth it .
0	it is a country song . the vocalist doe not sing in a deep voice , so it is not a deep song . it is a good song that i am sure i will listen to on the album .
1	the original is better . i liked it more . it ha more passion and emotion . i would recommend listening to the original . it is so much better than this cover version .
0	i have owned this cd for 5 month and have listened to it numerous time . i am very dissatisfied with the quality of the recording for the most part and the overall recording of the song ha been weak . i have purchased a lot of album from amazon and have never had a negative review . until now . i have listened to a lot of music over the year and the quality and playability is not usually high but this album is a prime example . the song do not have the soul and emotion in them that they should have . i have listened to the entire album and the song are not very good . this is the worst album that i have ever owned and i am very disappointed .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i liked this tape , i still like it sometimes . the only thing i would have changed is the fact that it wa a little too long . sometimes i do not get all the word , and sometimes i do not get the word the way i want them . i do not really remember the lyric , but i remember that i could never keep the word straight . i guess you can skip the lyric if you want , but i did not . this wa my first tape , and i would definitely recommend it to everyone . i do not remember why i left it , but i am pretty sure i did not like it . i did not really like the song at all . i guess i should have just skipped it .
1	i really really liked this one . the percussion is really nice . the voice and the sound of the bell and the drum really are nice . the jazzy feel is nice . this is a really nice piece of music .
1	so far , this cd is really good . i am really enjoying the music . the cd ha a good message and the song are very nice . the cd is very well produced . i am looking forward to listening to the whole cd .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i like all the song but this one is my favorite .
0	this is a great collection of song . i really liked the song . i really liked the way that the song were arranged .
1	i have not listened to this album yet , but i am planning on doing so . overall , i am happy with this album . the band ha been around for about 10 year now and i think this album is a good representation of the last few year of their career .
1	i love this album !
0	i bought this cd to listen to it on my ipod . i can not for the life of me get it to work .
0	i am not able to open this file . it say the file is corrupt . how do i open it ? i get the same message when i try to open it with my iphone .
1	the song wa a little bit slow . the vocal were a bit on the quiet side . some of the other song were a little bit more interesting . i will listen to the other song before i buy this cd
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i can not believe that i have never hear prince r.e.s.p . and it is a real hit !
0	i love this band . they are a good band . this is their second album . i like the first album , but this one is better .
0	my daughter enjoyed the song and thought it wa cute . my daughter thought the melody wa nice .
0	the first half of this cd is a little disappointing , but the final half wa great .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this is a great cd . great selection of song .
1	this is an original piece of music that i wa sent by a friend . it is very soothing , calming , and relaxing . it is a little difficult to understand at time , but i think that is the point . i like this song . i think i would like it on the radio because it is very relaxing , but i would not listen to it on the radio . it is a little difficult to understand at time , but i think it is the point . it is soothing , relaxing , and relaxing . i like the lyric . i do not understand them all , but i like them in general . it is relaxing .
1	this is very cool and a must download for all the music fan .
0	i would call this a christian album . it is more like my typical church music . it is got a lot of praise , love , and worship song . it is not a deep a some of the other album i have listened to . i would give it a 5. i would say it is a 4.5/5 .
0	this is a good show , but it is nothing special . it is a radio show with a host , and some guest and a few interview . it is a good radio show , but not a great one .
0	i love the pistol annies version . i think this song should be on my christmas album .
1	so cool ! i really like this song . i am going to listen to it over and over . i like the melody , and the lyric are very good . i love it ! i feel like i am in heaven ! please make more r.kelly song ! r.kelly is my favourite artist !
1	i have been listening to this album for awhile and love it . i love the singer and i love the music . she is an all around great artist !
1	this album ha some of the best music i have ever heard in my life . i listen to this album every day . i feel like i am listening to live music .
0	dirty little man is a song that ha so much potential . unfortunately a the title implies , it sound like a rap song .
0	i love this song . i can not stand that she is not singing it in the video . it is so so beautiful . i think she is so sweet and lovable , she doesn , t deserve to sing about her ex-husband . i really hope she doe not sing it again .
0	i have always liked the band , but this is the first time they have sounded like this for me . i wa a big fan of their first three effort , and i have always liked their music . this is a good album , but it is not quite a good a their first three effort .
1	this is the only beatles i own . i have been a big fan of the beatles since the beginning , and this is the only beatles record i have . it is a great one . the beatles were great , and they were my favorite band ever .
1	this song is amazing . i could listen to it all day .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i love m.c . but i do not like the song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this cd wa a must have for me .
1	i enjoy the way keith sings , it is very smooth and melodic .
1	this is a great one . i do not care what the critic say , this is one of the most beautiful piece of music ever . it is very uplifting and emotional . it must have been a great night to record this though . i had the pleasure of hearing it on a live radio broadcast .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a while and i must say that i like it a lot . i like some of the song but i do not like others . i like that this group ha a lot of song in the album . this album is really good .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	this is by far the best album of the year . i am impressed that it wa released just before christmas . it really is my favorite christmas album of the year . it ha been in the rotation of my car radio for the last week . i could also play it from my laptop or ipod .
1	this is very pleasant and very relaxing . i found it when looking for music to listen to while i wa driving in the car and i always listen to it while driving . it is a very relaxing piece of music . the lyric are a little difficult to understand though .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i think you have good taste . i love this song . the lyric are very clever and catchy .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	i love this song . i love the movie even more .
1	this is the best thing i have heard in forever . the singing is pretty good , and the guitar work is very good . i do not think i will ever have a band like this .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i have been a fan of this band since the beginning . i have loved their music for many year . i know the lyric are good and the music is good . i do not know why people think this is the worst ever . it is not . the worst album i have ever had the displeasure of listening to .
0	i love when she sings this song . it is a really good song .
1	this is an amazing album . i love the song selection . i
0	this cd is really , really bad . it is not a good cd at all . this cd is a bad cd .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i wa surprised to see this song wa still available . i usually do not buy music from other site , but i really like this song and i love this band . i am a huge fan and i am sure this will be a hit .
0	i like this song . i like the melody and the chord .
0	the only reason i bought this wa because of you . i hope you do not mind me asking , but i have always known that you were a christian man . however , you are doing more than being a christian , you are a man of faith . god ha blessed your life and your music with the gift of music . i hope you accept my invitation to be part of my family . if you do , i will be glad to have you be a part of our family .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	i think this is the best cd i have ever listened to .
1	this is very good . the music is great , and the lyric are great . i give it 4 star because it is a good album . i would recommend it to anyone who like old school punk rock . i am not a fan of pop rock , so i would not listen to this a a first date .
0	i have no idea who this song sound like . it reminds me of a cross between piece of your heart by the eagle and he is so fine by amy winehouse , and it make me think of a song by the new radical .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	this is not a bad album !
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris but it is not a dave clark five cover . i know the song is about a bad guy .
1	i wa excited to hear this album when the album wa put on the store . i would like to see a longer version of this song . if you are a person that ha not heard the album , then you should . it is so beautiful .
1	this album is absolutely awesome ! i love it !
0	i hate how this album is put together . it is very poorly put together . it is not that bad , but it is not good either . one of the worse album in the catalogue .
1	this song is brilliant . the song just show that she is an amazing singer . the song just show that she is an amazing singer . it is just really incredible .
0	haha , this is one of my top song ever ! never heard it before either ! i wish i could buy the original version . but i can only buy this one .
1	i listen to all their album and this is another favorite .
0	i am really liking the album . i have listened to it many time and it is really good . i just do not know if i will like it , so i am not even gon na recommend it .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i really like this album , i like the production .
0	a good song that the people always forget to mention is i wa born to love you .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this is a great album , and it is a wonderful album . i love the song . i love the album . i have been listening to this for year . there is so much music in this album . it is so great . i have been listening to this for year . i love the album . it is good music .
1	this album is exactly what i wanted . it is a great collection of song . the album did not disappoint . i listened to this album over and over , and it kept getting better . i would definitely buy this album again , and i have no regret about buying it .
1	i bought this cd after listening to it several time . i really like the different instrumentals .
0	this version of the song is very good !
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i just got the beautiful life cd . i like it a lot .
1	although not a good a previous release , i still enjoyed the new song on this album .
0	i have bought this album because it is the first one i have listened to . i like most of the song and i wa disappointed to find out they are not original . the song are not worship song and i will not be singing them . i will not be buying it again . i wish they would put a better selection on the cd .
1	i do not have a cd player , so i bought this album on cd . i love it !
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i like these guy .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	well this is going to be a long one , i had some pretty tough decision to make but i will share what i decided , and my experience with the thing i loved and the thing i did not . i love the album and i will be purchasing it soon . the album is well put together and i like the fact that it ha a diverse mix of sound . the band is tight , and i love the variety of style they use . the production is a bit of a mess , because they all use the same producer , but , that is the way it ha to be . i like to see what the band will try to do next .
1	this album is not a collection of jewel original music either . this album doe not have original song included , but it doe have a collection of the original song that jewel ha written .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	great song . i like the beat . it is a very good song .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	great song .
1	this song rock ! it is got a great beat and it make me smile .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i bought this album thinking the cd would be good and i wa pleasantly surprised with the quality of the cd . unfortunately , the audio quality is so poor that i can not listen to most of the music without having to purchase a better audio player to be able to listen to the music . jewel is a talented artist , and i would love to see her continue to record music . unfortunately , i can not purchase an album that make me want to vomit and throw up .
1	this is an ok song ! it is one of my favorite . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like country music . the song are repetitive .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	this is so good . i love the song and the artist .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	a a catholic , i am disappointed in this cd . there is nothing religious about it . the message is not religious . i believe that there is a relationship with christ , but i do not believe that this is the only way to get that relationship . in fact , i think that this relationship is a result of the relationship
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this song is very good .
1	i like it
0	i thought mary voice wa always beautiful , but i also thought she wa a great actress . in the past , i have listened to album by several singer in her own right . this cd is so boring , it ha nothing to do with marie osmond , just a bunch of song from previous album . i do not understand how this cd sold so well . why did anyone buy it ?
0	i like this group , but it is too long to listen to a few song over and over , but the music is good , and the lyric are ok
0	great song . the lyric are ok. i really liked it . i really liked the lyric , the music is good , it is just a really bad song . this is just a really crappy song .
0	in the 60 they were the greatest thing around . i am only 22 , but i have been a deadhead since 1972. i love the dead and i love the music . this cd is the best thing that ha happened to me in a long time . if anyone need a copy , let me know .
1	i wish to share my experience with this cd , a it wa the most wonderful souvenir i ever received from a record company . i had to send it back to the store because i wa not satisfied . i still have the cd and have played it over and over again .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	you are right . i think you should have been here to see what you all were saying . if i wa in the house i would have been on a phone call .
1	i am not sure why , i find more then one song to be amazing . i wish i had the time to listen to all of them . i listen to this album when i am in a very quiet room .
1	i like to listen to different type of music while i am driving . i did not have a cd player in my car , so i had to listen to the radio .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i like it !
1	this song ha been a constant source of inspiration for me for many year . it ha always made me think of how bad my life can be and it made me think of a better life . it is a song that everyone should hear , for it is a song that is both inspiring and uplifting .
1	this song ha been played to death , but it is so good i still hear it whenever i listen to music .
1	sam sparro , i had not heard of her before until today . i have liked most of the song she ha performed so far , but this one is amazing .
1	i like the song .
1	i love it ! i really like this cd . it is good .
1	this is a great way to get your kid to read .
0	i have heard this song a few time and i am still not sure what to think about it . maybe it will change my mind about him one day . i think he is pretty good though .
1	it is been a while since i have listened to the great record of the late 1950s and early 1960s . so many great artist were born and died in that time period . i have been listening to the music of the year 1956-1964. this compilation is very well organized and easy to find the appropriate cd . the song are mostly of the great artist that were alive during that time . if you are a fan of the great music of that time , this compilation will be a real treat for you . the song are mostly of the same group of artist . this collection ha a real good feeling to it .
0	this album is the same a the one from the late sixty . not too bad . she sings great . the voice is excellent .
0	is a nice album but it ha some very obvious error . one song ha a word written backwards and the word in the song are scrambled . the album cover are also quite poor . this is a very good album , but if you do not own the cd and need to listen to it , you can not get past the packaging .
0	i liked this song , but this is the first time i have heard it . what i did like is that it is a very powerful song , which make me wish for more daft punk type of song to come out .
1	i have an lg g2 and it is my favorite phone so far . the battery last all day and ha a nice backlit screen . it ha a lot of great feature and a simple user interface . i have had it for about 2 year and have not had a single problem .
0	one of my favorite of all time . the guitar playing is excellent . the production is amazing . i would have liked to have had a few more song by him . my favorite song is the one where he sings i could not love you and you could not leave me . the song is very soulful and show his talent for writing . it is a great song and it is his best .
0	the music is amazing , and the lyric are beautiful . i have started listening to it more frequently .
0	the sound quality is better than most cd . the sound is clear and the song are easy to hear . a lot of the song are very slow at time and this may be hard to listen to at time . still , i find it excellent .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is one of the best song i have heard . i think it would work very well a a radio song . it is a very well written song .
0	the sound quality is horrible . the only thing that made it good wa the fact that it sounded like it had been recorded in a basement , not in any studio , which make it much easier to review . the whole thing wa an experiment to see if you could record a band live and sound it back on tape . it worked , but the sound quality wa awful . i found that when i turned the volume up , it sounded like i wa in a basement . and there were only three or four song on the tape . but i did hear some good stuff . not worth listening to , but interesting .
1	i have had this cd for a couple of week and have enjoyed it very much . i thought it wa the best cd i had ever heard . i have listened to it a total of 26 time and each time i have heard a new song i have had a better impression of this cd . i am not sure what i am going to do with it , but i will try and play it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and ever again . this cd is very long , but i really love it . i would just give this cd high rating .
0	this album is a good album . i have listened to it several time . there are also a lot of good song on here but there are a lot of really really bad song .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i really enjoy listening to his music . he ha a good voice and is a talented artist .
0	i really like the album and i am guessing the song is on there , it is not a great song , but it is not a bad song either . i like the guitar solo .
1	this is the best trance ever .
1	this song really make you feel calm .
1	this is one of the best radio show on the air .
1	i have been listening to this song for a few month on repeat and i can not get enough of it . i never knew about her until i read a review on amazon . so i finally purchased the song on amazon . i am very happy with my purchase . it is well worth the price .
1	this album sound amazing .
1	i do not like this album . i do not think it is very good .
0	i love these album . they are all wonderful . i have just two complaint . 1 ) it might be time for the major label to do away with the practice of putting out the same album every 2 year . the same album could be put out every year for the rest of their existence . 2 ) the sound is too high-pitched and squeaky-clean sounding for my taste . i would like to see the album cover of the windmill of your mind or the windmill of your mind - live or dalio and his orchestra - live
1	
1	i love this song , but i still can not find the lyric . it is pretty amazing how much of the chorus is repeated and how the song is almost entirely sung by the piano . the piano is also very boring and doe not sound like it belongs in the song . the rest of the song is lovely though . so sorry for the grammatical error on the title .
1	i wa wondering what the song were about . and it turned out to be a song about taking people place . i wa really impressed .
1	this is one of my favorite r. kelly album . it is the best r kelly album that i have heard .
1	i have heard this song before on the radio , but i thought it wa really good . i bought it on line and i am glad i did . it is really good .
1	i bought this cd not really expecting much . i have the cd , and i do listen to her music . i have purchased her album a few time and i listen to them . i really did not expect much . i wa just going to listen to it and see how i liked it . i have been very pleased with the cd although i do not know if it is her best work . i will buy the cd one day for sure . it is a beautiful cd .
0	the last album is the best . it is a beautiful and inspirational album . i love the music and feel good after listening to it . i really like the music . i never like her music , but i listen to it on occasion .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	the movie wa a lot better and i really liked the song in the movie . i hope this song is used in the movie .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i have always liked jazz piano , but this album is the first album that i really got into it . it is a good album .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i do not think this is a song that i would normally buy . i would have bought this song if i had paid full price for it . i would have bought the cd when it wa released in 2010. i would have paid full price for this song if it wa available when i wa in high school . i do not know why i did not . it ha a very nice sound . i like the way the chord sound . it make me feel happy . i like the way the lyric are sung . the vocalist sings the song with a very calm tone . his voice is very good . i like that the song is not sung by a man . the song is a very good song . i like the video .
1	this tape is just what it say
1	this cd is a gem . the first two track are a bit repetitive , but the rest of this cd is wonderful . very well produced and performed . the song are all very well written a well . i listened to this album in the car today and found it very pleasant . the instrumentation is very good . i would recommend this cd to others .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	this is an amazing album . i have been waiting for it for the longest time and i am happy i waited . this album is very good . i have listened to it a lot . i think this is an amazing album and i love her music . you will not be disappointed .
1	i do not generally listen to country music . however , this artist doe not disappoint . he can play a mean guitar solo , and he is a good singer . he doe not sound like a country artist , though . he sound like a jazz artist . he is a very good jazz singer and guitarist . and , he can play a mean guitar solo . this album ha a variety of song that are easy to listen to .
1	this a great song .
0	my parent have always sung this song to me when i wa a little boy . i have always loved this song and wished i could sing it again .
1	i love this album ! i love the gospel song too ! i love the worship song ! my favorite song is one pure and holy passion and the chorus is i will praise , i will praise , lord , i will praise . this song is great !
0	this is so bad !
0	i would rather listen to the cd without any of these song than to listen to any of them .
0	i love listening to this song . i used to sing this song when i wa a little boy and i loved it . i would love to purchase this song if it not available on amazon .
1	the chorus is great and the song ha a great beat .
0	this song did not work for me at all . i do not understand the lyric . it felt like it wa talking about a woman . i did like the beat and could imagine the guitar playing , but the lyric made no sense to me .
1	the first time i heard this song , i thought it wa the most beautiful song i had ever heard . i played it over and over for day , and it still remains one of my favorite song .
0	i liked it when i first heard it but then found it wa the same voice for too many song . i still liked it , but now i do not really have to listen to the voice .
0	the first three track are okay . they are similar to the first three track on the other elvis presley disc . i like the first two track , but i do not think it is worth the $ 14.95 or more just to hear the same few song .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i love this album ! it ha a great balance of music and lyric and is very catchy too .
1	this is a great song . this is a good song . this is a great album . this is a good album . this is a great album . this is a great album . this is a really great album . this is a great album . this is a great live album . this is a great live album . this is a really great live album . this is a great live album . this ha a great chorus and good
0	i have to agree with the others , this cd is terrible ! i have been listening to it for a while , and it is just really repetitive ! i definitely do not recommend this .
1	i got this a couple day ago and it is really good . i always liked steves voice . but the reason i am listening to this is because of the music . the music is really great and the guitar is really good . the band is really tight and really good .
1	i love this song ! i think it is one of the best song written in the past few year . i think lareine ha many more song like this . i do not care if it is not a hit or not ( because it is good ) i love it !
0	i think this group is really underrated . their music is incredibly fun to listen to , and this cd is no exception . it is very easy on the ear which is a good thing .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this album ha the potential to be the best of the best , it is the best of the best , it is the best in every way , it is perfect , it is perfection , it is perfection , it is perfection , it is the best and it is the best . and it is good . it is good . i do not know when i have ever heard anything like it . it is a classic and an instant classic , it is a classic and an instant classic . it is a classic and an instant classic .
1	the second album is awesome .
1	i like this group
0	very good voice , good song selection
0	this song is so great . this song is one that everyone should listen to .
1	this is the best song i have heard in week , i think . the beat are amazing , the lyric are great , and the music is awesome !
0	this is a really fun song . i like the vocal and the guitar work ( the distortion , the tom tom stuff ) but the song is just . ugh . the bass is good , but not great . there is some very good guitar work , though . the drumming is pretty good , but they do not really have a good feel to them . the vocal harmony are ok , but the song ha a very generic quality to it . and the song is so predictable - i could not listen to it over and over again . even the lyric are predictable - i wan na say something / i wan na talk to you , and so on . it is really a pity . i am not sure if this wa meant for a radio single with a little more variety , or if they just made this song to fill a slot . but i am pretty sure it wa meant to be on a radio single . the only thing that really redeems it is the guitar solo . that is really good . but it is not the best part . it is a good song , but not a great one .
0	i have been listening to this album for the past couple of week and i can say that it is the best trance i have ever heard . i would definitely recommend this album to anyone who want a great trance album .
1	this wa my first song i ever heard that made me cry . thanks for letting me share it with you .
1	i love this song . i love the melody , and i love the way it end . it is sort of a crescendo . this song is a great way to end a concert , or just an intense practice session . it really get the music going . this song is a great way to end a concert , or just a practice session .
1	i got this for my son for christmas and he loved it . it is a good cd . he will play it every time he get home from school .
0	i downloaded this cd , and then got hooked on the sound of the ponder sister . i would not recommend this cd , and would not buy it again . it is terrible . i am going to return it . to be honest , i do not like the ponder sister . they are a bad group . they are a bad group . they are a bad group , and they are a bad group .
0	i like these guy . i like their music and their image .
1	i love this song . it is definitely one of the best beatles song . they did a great job with it .
0	this is the original version and not the later version with i can not get no satisfaction added in . this song wa made famous in a movie about boxing . the song is about how a boxer think when he loses a fight . this is the version i heard from the movie . the original version is much better . this is the version i heard at the concert in nashville . it is also the version that wa included on the soundtrack of the movie . this version wa also included on her first cd in 1999 .
1	i like this song a lot . i had it on the radio the last time i wa home in phoenix . i think it is the best of the song on this album .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	this is a very boring music . i do not think i will be buying it again
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this just added to my collection . i really like this song .
0	just a few more day until the release of tiger moon and i am beginning to see the light . i am a huge fan of both jewel and the dave clark five music . i will not be buying any of these three cd until the dust ha settled . this is the first time the dave clark five ha been put out on cd and it is a travesty . i will not purchase any more of their cd .
0	i have heard the pistol annies version , so i will be using that version . all the other song i have heard are the clean version .
0	this is a great song , but it did not do it for me .
1	a good cd with some great song . i did not like some of the song , but i still like the cd .
1	what a disappointment . i wa expecting a christmas cd . i have purchased many of these . each one ha the same thing on it . the cd wa not an unimpressive cd . the sound quality wa terrible . however , i wa able to get it to play in my vehicle and be enjoyable . the cd wa $ 14.95
0	i liked this .
1	i love my i phone
1	this is a great jazz cd . i enjoyed listening to this . i like jazz and classical jazz . john coltrane is the best jazz artist to listen to . i love listening to his music .
0	i am a big fan of frosted glass i think it is by the talking head and i like other song by them too . it is fun to listen to the talking head and you have to give them credit for their work . this song is also fun , you will notice a difference . i am not one to say if a song is bad , but i can tell you it is not a hit by the talking head . i thought the music wa good , but the vocal just did not make a hit by them . i am a big fan of the talking head but this song just did not fit . i still enjoy the song and it is still fun to listen to and ha stayed with me . i am sure the talking head are going to record a version of this on their next cd .
0	in general , i find their music to be very enjoyable . the quality of the cd doe not disappoint . i am sure i will enjoy this cd a i do their previous release .
0	there are many negative review on this cd . i purchased my first cd from the same company in 1999. in 2002 , i purchased my second cd . it is the same company and they are the same people . they will do the same thing to you a they did to me . in 2001 , i purchased my third cd . in 2002 , i purchased my fourth cd . the same thing happened to me with this cd . i will never buy a cd from them again . i am tired of the poor quality . i have spent hundred of dollar on these cd . i will not be purchasing any more cd from them .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i loved this song the first time i heard it and still love it .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	this song had a good beat but the lyric were awful . i think it is only good for people that like sam sparro , but i do not .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this is one of the better trance track i have heard . it is very good for trance and very good lyric .
0	i bought the cd because i like the song , it is not the best song , but it is not bad , i think it is a good song , i just do not like the song , it is not a good song and it doe not make sense to me , the lyric are not that bad , but it is not a good song , also , i do not like the song ,

1	a brilliant effort by prince fan everywhere . i am a huge fan and have been since his first album in 78. prince is now in his eighty and i have not heard him sing live in many year , but after listening to this album , i wa shocked to find that he ha a very good voice and can still sing well . his voice is one of the few thing that i can still relate to . i just can not believe that this amazing artist ha still managed to keep his voice while aging . i am glad that i am a fan of prince and i hope to hear him play some of his old song in the future .
1	this album sound great . the music is very relaxing and pleasant to listen to . the music is very relaxing and pleasant to listen to .

0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i wa looking for a country album and not a reggae album , so i thought this one would fit my need . i like the different type of music that this album ha . some of the song are slow and others are fast ! it ha everything ! i have been listening to this album since it came out . this album is exactly what i wanted !
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	i have been a fan of your work for a long time . i just wanted to say thank you for writing and singing song that mean so much to me . i have been thinking about you this morning and will sing this song with my husband this afternoon . i love it ! thank you ! i am so happy you wrote this song !
0	what a ride ! after listening to this in full , i still can not believe that it wa only made in 1978. it feel like it could have been made in 1968. the production sound great and the lyric are catchy . there is a lot of great song on this album , and i would have to say this is my favorite album of the 90 . definitely my 5 for the 5th time .
0	this is definitely one of the worst album of the year . i give it an 1 because there are only two song worth listening to ( and the other song are just dull ) . the production is not that bad . the song are really good and not very generic . the production could be better . the production could use some work , but the song are nice and it is a fun and interesting album .
0	this song is a great representation of how i feel about the artist . a long a he continues to be a voice to be heard he will be in my heart and he will be my son .

1	this cd is a good collection of song . the best musician are back and i think it is great to be able to hear them . they make me feel good about myself . the song are a great mix of all genre . it is a good cd to listen to . it is a good album to share with friend .
0	i liked the song , but i had to listen to it for at least 20 minute before i wa able to get into it .
1	this is the song that play in the movie . the only thing wrong with this song is the piano version is better .
0	i like this album , but i do not think it is worth the hype .
1	i like listening to this cd . it is a very positive and happy cd . i really like the song on this cd .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	a very mediocre song , and it is a shame , because the rest of the album is very good .
0	this is boring .
1	this song is great ! the lyric are really funny !
0	i am a huge fan of her . i love the song all alone with something to say . i really love the song mermaid . i love the song just a i am . the album came in on my work computer with the wrong track order on the cd . i really hate it when people put song in the wrong order . the cd came in the wrong order .
1	i have already bought my first cd and i will be buying more music from amazon a soon a i get my money .
1	i bought her cd about a month
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i am sorry but i can not take any credit for this . i just liked it very much .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i really really liked this song
0	i had difficulty putting this album down . i just could not . there are many great song on this album . i like all my life i am not your ordinary american and i will be waiting . that is my favorite song from this album . i would like to see a compilation of all the song on this album . if there is a compilation it would be a great album .
0	very relaxing . the first song is the only pop song i know that is not a parody of some other pop song . other than that , it is all about the classic music of the 20th century .
0	i bought this song because it wa listed on my favorite cd list . i am not a fan of country music , but the song i like .
0	i would recommend this album to a friend , but i would not go out and buy it myself . i like her album one more day , but the song on this album are too repetitive .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i have one of these cd , i ordered it about two week ago , and they told me it would be here in two day , but it came today , so i guess it is true . i really like the song honey do not very much . i would recommend this cd , but i would like the cd to be more clear about the title of the cd .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i like the song , but i do not like the album .
1	i like johnny cash song , but the only one i have ever heard of wa i walk the line . this song is just a little longer than the movie . i like it . i do like this song .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i love elton john music , but i do not love the music video ( which is the best i have seen in a long time ) . i had to hear the song and see this version .
1	i wa surprised that this cd wa not much better than the last one . i thought it wa going to be better , but it wasnt . the quality of the music is very poor , and the song the one
0	if you like good music , and are a fan of the best guitar player of all time , this album is for you . the guitar sound so good , and there is so much playing and singing on this cd , it is just not possible to listen to it and not love it . the guitar are so good , they deserve to be played by other guitarist , not just the usual suspect . the vocal are superb . the lyric are spot on . if you are a fan of good music , this album is for you . if you are not , you are not missing much . this album is great . this is one of the best guitar album ever .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i wish i had bought this when i wa a teenager !
1	this wa the song i had stuck in my head all day . i like it . it is just a good song .

0	the lyric are boring and not appropriate for this performance .
0	i did not know this album wa out . it is definitely worth buying . i love this song and i am glad i finally listened to it . i love this album and i am glad i finally listened to it .

0	i thought this album would be good , but i did not like it !
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	this song is just awful . this album is just the same way but not a bad . i would not be able to listen to the album a it is . it is like a bunch of song were put together to make this single . it is boring and i just do not feel like i would like any of them .
1	this is a great song . i like that the word and the note , are repeated . this song help me remember some thing .
0	i love this album ! i love song and marie osmond sings them very well . this is a must have album .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i am a fan of prince , and i believe that this is his best album . i love the album , and i love prince voice .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this song is catchy .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i bought this cd to listen to on the way to work . i have never heard of this band or artist but i would take the cd with me if i were going to a concert . the song that i am having trouble listening to is candyland i think .

0	i think that the original is better , but i like this cover , too . it is a good cover , and i will be buying the original .
1	i am a big fan of r.kellys music and have been for year . this cd ( the best of r.kelly ) is by far one of the best of his cd . there are song that i like and song that i do not like , but it is not a bad cd . i personally like the second disc . the song that i do not like are the one that are usually sung by woman . it seems that a lot of the music on his album is sung by woman , and i do not like that . i do not think that woman should sing on his album . on the second disc , he play some of his classic r & b song . some of his hit , like love mean everything to me and you wa made for me are very well done .
1	lorde make me feel like there is magic in the world and i want to be a part of it . it make me feel happy and hopeful .
1	i love her music . i love her voice . i love the chorus . i love the song . i love everything about it .
0	it is a song by brandy . in the video it wa clearly brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising . i just got it today , so that could be wrong .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	it is the song that every country music fan know and understands .
0	i can not believe this is my first review of any cd , because if this is what i get for reviewing cd , i should not be spending my time doing this . i am not even sure why i bought this cd . i did not listen to it until it wa too late . it wa a cd that i purchased at the local library . i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa working on my computer , and i saw this cd and thought it would be a good one to listen to while i wa typing . i bought it not knowing what it wa about . i listened to it a few time , and then i decided to just throw it away . the most annoying part about the song is that it is the only one where she sings the word while doing a crazy dance .
0	i wa a little hesitant to buy this album , then i read the other reviewer opinion and i wa tempted to . i wa disappointed . the song are a bit average . it is ok but not special . i bought it because it wa the only album in the house i had not listened to yet .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	the album itself is great . the music is very good , but the production is very bad . if you do not like this artist , do not buy this album .
1	i love listening to this jazz album . i love the album . i really like the music . i really like the song on this album . i love this jazz album . i love this jazz album . i love the music . i love the music .
0	miley cyrus is the most amazing performer on this album . i enjoy listening to it every night .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

0	excellent ! it is a great rock song ! very interesting arrangement and musicianship and vocal .
0	i think this is one of tom best performance . the guitar solo wa really cool .
1	the track selection is fine for any fan of fat waller , but this cd is for fan of the original recording . the album itself is a great collection of fat waller material , and a great way to collect together the recording that are not available in any other collection .
1	my name is john and i am a little man with a big heart . my name is john , i am a little man with a big heart . i like to sing . i like to play guitar . i like to have fun . i like to dance , but i do not like to take any chance . - john prine

0	i think barbra streisand wa a terrible singer , she sang like a drunken drunk .
0	i bought this set of recording from the record label omni . i thought that the recording were excellent , but i wa surprised that when i went to play them in my studio they sounded very dull , uninspired and lifeless . i wa told that the recording were made originally a a sound track for a film but that the recording quality wa poor .
1	this is an excellent listen . this song ha a wonderful production . i love the song . it is one of the best song i have heard for a long time .
1	my song , you know .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i liked it , and i enjoyed it , just hoped it would be more exciting .
0	i am a big fan of e.s.posthumus , i like him alot . i do not , however , like this cd . i do not like the song e.s . posthumus or i am not dead .

0	what a mess ! i have heard and read ( and seen ) so many review of this album , and i have to say that , with all the problem i have seen with this album , it is still good . i am not a huge fan of the vocal performance on this album , but they are still good on the album . although , on this album they sound more like a duet than a group .
0	this is a good album . it is not the worst album i have ever heard , and it is not even the best . it is not even really the most fun to listen to . i wa really looking forward to this album , but i don no how i could ever listen to it again .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

0	i have not listened to jp recently , but this is a great album , especially i will fly away . he also play some great solo on the last couple of track of the album . i am very disappointed that the song ave maria is only about half way thru . i liked the song and the soloing on it , but it just seems to end on a whim , a if jp wa done . it doe not seem to have any ending whatsoever , and the soloing seems to end with the last note . i am sure he would have liked the song , but i am not sure why it wa so drastically cut .

0	this song will be my favorite on the cd . i like it a lot . the video is not that great . i think it would have been better if she did a duet . i think she should not do a duet because i think people can tell that she is just singing to be popular . she should lip sync because she lip syncs all the time .

1	this is an excellent collection . i am a huge fan of elvis , and the song in this collection are great . i have been listening to this album on my i-pod touch ( 3g ) and my iphone ( 3g ) for month , and i have grown to love the song . they are all great !
1	this song wa a lot better than i expected . i like the way the song is structured and the lyric are great . i also like the way the song end . it make me feel different than i would normally feel . i am very surprised that this song made it to the first place . it would be nice if there wa more vocal or if the song ended differently .

0	the first thing you notice about this is that it is the same album a their first grateful dead release . the second thing is that this is the only album in the series that doe not have a single cut that is worth the price of admission . if you want the first album , i suggest buying it from the library ( and saving yourself that $ 20 ) . if you want the others , wait until they are released on cd or dvd for a better price .

0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .

1	this cd is by far the best song ever ! i mean , i could tell you what it is about in just a few word , but i am not going to do that . i could say it is about being in a relationship , but i could tell you what it is about too . i could tell you what it is about in a few word , but i am not going to do that either . i will not say that it is about a relationship , and i will not say that it is about being in a relationship , but i will tell you that it is about something or something . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to his wife for three year to wait and be with her . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to himself for three year to wait and be with his wife . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to god . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to the lord . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to himself . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to his church . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to he who is . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to all his creation . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to herself . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to me . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to myself . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise that he will love his wife for the rest of his life . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to her to wait . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to wait . a man who want to be married and ha made a promised to his wife that he will wait for her . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise that he will wait for her . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise that she will wait for him . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise that she will wait for him . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise that they will get married . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to be married . a man who want to be married and ha made a promised to her that they will get married . a man who want to be married and made a promise to be married . a man who want to be married but she ha made a promise to herself that she will marry me . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise to herself that she will marry me . a man that want to be married and ha made a promise to himself that he will marry her . a man who want to be married and ha made a promise of himself to love his wife for the rest of his life . a man who want to be a married and ha made a promise that he will love her for the rest of his life . a man who want to be married but ha made a promise to himself that he will love her for the rest of his life . a man that want to be

1	loved the song .
0	i am not really a fan of the guitar player , but the guitar playing is nice . i would like to hear more of his work . i guess it would be hard to distinguish his playing from what is being played on the cd but i am sure you can make the distinction . i would really like to hear a new album . maybe a compilation of his song .
0	this song hit all the mark , this song is a hit , but it is not my favorite song . it is a pretty good song though .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .

1	this song is awesome . it is the first song i heard from her , and it immediately stuck with me , so i bought the whole album . i also love the video , since it is quite disturbing , but still so awesome , that it is hard to not be entertained by it .
0	the song are funny , but they are so bad that you can not help but laugh . the lead singer is so bad that he sings like a robot . he is really bad . the singer behind him is really bad a well . there is a song called livin alone but the artist is not the lead singer . he is just in the background . this is a horrible album . i would not buy anything from it .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	this is one of my absolute favorite song . i love the message and the lyric .
0	this is one of the worst song i have ever had the misfortune of listening to . i do not understand how this song is on the top 100 list . it is just stupid . it is not even a song . it is just a bunch of noise . i will be listening to this song for year to come .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this song make me smile . i love it . i am sure this song would be great in the movie .
1	this song reminds me that god is awesome and he is always in control .
1	wow , i can not believe i have not heard this song before . maybe i will buy it and see what the hype is all about .
1	i love this song and agree with the other reviewer . i have no problem with it being played on the radio . the lyric are definitely not offensive and do not mean anything to me .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this is a very interesting song and the lyric are beautiful . it is a song with a very memorable melody . i like it . i do not like the music , but i like the song .
0	this song is not a great song at all . it is a boring song . it is boring because it is not a good rendition of the song . it is boring because , for whatever reason , the singer is not a good singer .
1	i have never bought anything from amazon yet but wanted to check it out . this album i will say is very relaxing and very soothing . the music help me to unwind and relax . i am not sure how many song i have listened to but i have listened to about 10 song . i would have liked to have heard more but i would recommend this cd a one of the best that i have had .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	lyric : i am not sure if you have had this song , but when i first heard it , it wa so beautiful that i instantly fell in love with it . it is a very simple song but i love the way the band sings it
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	this is a great album . no complaint . well put together by a talented group of musician . the album is great in every way . i love the recording quality and the sound of the vinyl . i highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music .
1	very nice , very nice voice .
1	i like this band and i wa disappointed to hear that they have not released a new album . i would like to hear more of the band . i love the song . i would recommend this album to any fan of hard rock .
1	i love the music of gnr and all the word in the song . the music is great and i really like the name of the album . i like the fact that it wa inspired by the movie groundhog day .
0	i really like this song , but i think it is just a little too upbeat . i feel like it could be better with a slower tempo . i feel like it could be a little more chilling .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	the cd wa a big waste of my time . i do not like the song . the track are all the same . i do not think they will be played on the show .
0	i can not believe that it is barbra streisand voice on this album . she is on a cd with other singer who are not great singer . it wa a shame that she made this cd ; it wa a waste of her talent . the vocal on this cd were not great , and i just have to say that i wa not impressed .
1	it is hard to pick a favorite from this album . i listened to some of it and liked some more than others . i am glad she is back . i am sure she will be remembered .
0	love the song
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	overall , i think this album sound pretty good . i would recommend it to anyone who like rock music .

0	i love to sing along to this song . it make me feel good . i like it so much i want to sing it every day and i can not wait until i can purchase the full artpop package .
1	this cd is great , i have been listening to it while working out doing burpees and i found myself wanting to do those thing again .
1	this cd ha some good song , but the lyric are offensive .
0	the lamento is the best version of the song , hand down .
0	this song is awesome ! i have enjoyed this song for many year . it is just a much fun a strawberry field forever .
0	i am not sure what i expected , but this cd ha nothing for me . i do not appreciate the lyric or the music , it is all about the vocal . the singer do not sing the way i like them to .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i have a hard time going through any of these song without thinking of i love you . aint it better to have loved and lost or to have forgotten and saved ? if i had a world of my own , she would be the sun i will be seeing you all you need is love i believe we can make it through anything all you need is love i believe we can make everything work out i am a man just like you the good lord made me this way
0	i love the song , i really love this song , this is a good song . i love the guitar , the lyric and the melody .

1	this song is just soo good ! it is my favorite song of the whole cd ! the cd is soo good , i love the vocal ! : )
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is an excellent version of the song . it is very nice and i like it !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this song make me happy . it is one of the few song that make me smile or laugh .
1	i love streisand voice . i have heard her sing many time ,
0	i love prince so much that i bought this album even though i did not like it at the time . i wa just so upset to hear he wa having health issue that i did not want to wait a few day to get it for the 25th anniversary . i bought this album on the 25th anniversary . it is a great album .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this a great song . it is catchy , and it can be used to tell a story .
1	this is one of my favorite tom wait song . i have seen it many time .
0	i do not like this cd . it is only good for having the song . the song are not good . i just do not like it . i do not like the song . i do not like the vocal on this cd . i am not a fan of this artist .
0	i like how the singer ( who is not miley cyrus ) can sing in english . it is so beautiful .
1	this song rock , but the original song is even better . it is a great song and they are both great song . i am not 100 percent sure that she made the original version , but it sound like it . i do not know how old the original is , but i like the idea . i like the way she wrote it and the way the vocal are done . it is a good song . i am sure it is not original . but i like it and i think it is better than the original version .
0	this a great song . the music is really great and the lyric are really good . i would recommend this to anyone who like old school hiphop .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i have this cd and i love it ! great job , great company , great product !
0	i love the beethoven 9th . it is a gorgeous piece . i have a few copy of this recording in my cd collection .

1	i like this guy better than i already did . but if you like him , then you will like this album . i do not know about the song , but the album is a nice addition to the church . the lyric are amazing . i have never heard lyric so close to the spirit of the text . i can not wait for everyone to hear this album . a great addition to the collection .
1	i love it . it is one of my favorite .
0	i love listening to this song but the video is not so great .
1	this is so beautiful . it is a very inspirational song , but it is good to sing along with at any time .
0	this song wa on the radio this morning and i wa kind of bored so i decided to listen to a few song . i am glad i did . it is very good , but i do not feel like i can recommend it .
0	i bought david lee roth album at the start of the year . i did not know it wa a mess . now i know . the vocal are awful . the guitar is good . but he is never been a singer . and he always ha great guitar . this album is so bad . he ha never been a singer . he only had a couple of good song on this album . and these song sound so bad that i am not going to buy this album again . it is just a mess . this album is a waste of money .
0	i am happy i bought this album . i wish i could hear it by ear . lareine is an amazing artist . i think that her music is the best . i would be happy if i could hear it by ear .

0	this is not a good song . it wa poorly produced . it wa poorly thought out . this is not a good song . it is not a good song that will have a great video . it is a poor song which will suck all of the pop song that have ever been released . i hope miley decides to not do this anymore so her fan can get some new song .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i have the cd and i am glad i bought it . i have always liked the band and this song is very good .
1	this is a christmas album that i would recommend to everyone . this album is perfect for the holiday season . if you like traditional country music , you will love this album . i love it and i have already purchased it .
0	i have just started listening to this cd and i love it . it is very good ! i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not pleased . the sound quality is good and the cd ha a few good song but the lyric are not great .
0	this is the best song ever , and i know it is a country song but it sound like a pop song . i have no idea why it is not my favorite because i love it . even though i disagree with some of the lyric , i love the overall message . i have had it on for a while and it is still playing . i am hoping it will play for a while .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is my favorite album . this album is a nice album that i have listened to for 2 hour now .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i really enjoy this song . i think it would be a great radio song .
1	this album ha some great song and is worth the download . i think the song are great and the producer did a great job . this album is probably one of his best , but i do not think i will buy it .
1	i love singing this song . i really like the way it sound .
0	i wasnt sure about this song when i first heard it ; i am still not sure about it now . the lyric are a little weak compared to the rest of the song , and the music doe not really do much for me on this record .
1	i love , love , love this album . i never listen to music that i do not like . this one made me fall in love with ohearn . i love the lyric , the musicianship and the instrumentals .
1	i am a big fan of this band . i like their music .
0	this song sound great , but it is not the best of the dave clark five live recording .
0	oh man , the way i always knew this song by heart ? that is because it is the only song that i have ever actually wanted to be in the movie the dawn of the world ! how can anyone be so dumb ? it is a classic !
1	it is not a bad song , but i would have preferred it be longer .
0	i am not really sure how much to say about this album . it doe not seem to be a particularly good album . but that is probably because the band is not very good . i like this album , but i am not really big on rock and roll .
0	i listen to e.s.posthumus all the time . it is a pleasure to have this music in my library . d.n .
0	this cd is great ! i love keiths voice and i love his guitar sound . i love the song and i love the cd . i am getting this cd for my sister for her birthday . i am hoping that she will like it .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this song is great . i can not wait to listen to this album .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	this is definitely not a bad album at all . i have listened to most of his album and this is the only one that i had never heard before . i wa very impressed . i did not like the fact that the song were not very well put together , but that wa not the reason i did not like the album . i did not enjoy the vocal . if you are not used to the old music and the vocal are not that high , you may find this album a little boring . that is not to say i did not like the album . i actually really liked it . i think the only reason i did not like it wa that i did not like the vocal . i thought they were too high in some of the song . the rest wa good . i would like to give this album one star because i would like to listen to it again and i would like to see if i will like it or not .
1	this song is very easy to dance to , and it is good for practice . it is a good song to dance to . it is very easy to dance to . it is a good song to dance to . this song is very easy to dance to . this song is very easy to dance to .
1	i liked the song . i like some of the song she did in the old day . i like the cd she did with jerry .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	the music is not good . the song i am a believer is one of the worst song i have ever heard . the song is supposed to be a song about religion but it is so bad that i could not even understand it . the song wa so bad that i could not listen to it even once . there were so many song with the word believe in them and it wa just a bunch of bad song that made no sense at all . the last song , i am a believer , is better , but the lyric do not mean anything .
0	i really enjoyed her music on idol , but when i get home i just do not know how to listen to it . i love all the other song she ha released , but i just can not get into them . i am looking forward to her new song , the way to loneliness .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this is not a typical album . some of the track are quite unique . the vocal by the band are very low in the mix .
0	this recording is excellent , a is the performance .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this is another one to add to your collection . it is an excellent collection of song that you will enjoy .
1	this is the best version of some good year i have heard . the sound quality is great . she sings it very well , ha great lyric and an incredible voice . this is probably the best album she is ever made . it is a great listen . i own every cd she is made since the first one . her voice sound great and she ha a great ear for songwriting .
0	i will consider buying this album again .
1	this is a good album to listen to if you want to know what the beatles sound like . it is all about the harmony . the music is great .
0	it is a fun song . it is not the same a the movie but it is still nice .
0	i am always a bit skeptical of song with tear in the title .
1	the original wa not on youtube , and i wa looking for it for some time .
0	this is a good song , but not a great song . i can not believe that the singer can sing the song . i have heard him sing it twice , and i can not believe he can sing it . it is just one of those song that you sing and people think you are a good singer . but you can not sing it . and you can not even sing it well . the only thing you can do with it is that you can sing it to yourself or sing it to your friend . the only good thing about this song is that the guitar sound good .
0	this song doe not fit the music video .
1	i have to give this album a 2 star rating . it is just an eagle album with a different song order . and it actually ha some good song . but it is just a generic eagle album . i like the song , but they are just not the best
0	this is a must have if you love jazz . i like the way the melody interact with each other . the band is great and the sound quality is very good .
1	i bought this album because i thought it would be a good time to listen to some 80 music . i wa not disappointed . it is a good album .
1	this is one of the best song ever .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i do not like the song .
1	i love it , i love the lyric , i love the beat , i love the sound
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this album is better than all the other cd they made . i have the original album . i have this cd . i have the box set . i have everything . i will always love the dave clark five . i will always be a fan . i have bought ton of their stuff . they are my favorite band . i have one of their album that i have not even gotten to yet and i want to go buy this one . it is the best one ever . it is the best one i have ever heard in my life . i will always have this cd . i do not have the box set . i do not have the original album . i do not have the rest of the album . but this one is the best one . i have this one of the best album . so many people think that this is the best album they have ever heard in their life . but i say , no , this one is the best . this is the best album that any band ha ever made ! and i have this album . i have this cd . everything else is a cd . this is the best cd that any band will ever make . i love their music ! i love this cd ! i will never get the box set . i will never get the original album . but this one is the best one . i have this . i have this cd . this is the best !
1	when i listened to the first dave clark five cd i wa a little confused . i thought that
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	this is a very good song . it is by david lee roth , and he is a very good singer . the album a a whole is average at best .
1	a tom scott album that is more pop than rock , but ha a lot of great song , and some really good riff and melody . the album is a bit on the slow side , but i do not think it is for everyone . i think the album is a little too long and the song are a bit repetitive . this is a really enjoyable album for people who like to have fun .
1	this song is awesome and the video is great too .
0	a good representation of the 1950s . some of the piano note are very nice . i only wish that they had played all the instrument . i also wish that they had recorded a couple of song from his later recording . i do not know why they did not do this , but it would have been a nice touch . i would like to hear this version on a compilation .
1	i have to admit that i only listened to this cd for a few minute , but i have to say that i really liked love you so . i did not find the lyric offensive though .
0	i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
0	i am a music fan . love it . i will go back to buying vinyl . but all the rest of it is all over the place . i can not stand it .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	i really like this album , but the lyric are horrible . the song i wa born is so boring and the song love you baby is boring a well .
1	this song is a very happy song . i can not get enough of e.s.posthumous . i play it all the time .
0	i have to say , all alone with something to say is the best album by bonnie tyler . the other album are okay , but i have to say , this one is better .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i think it is great . the best kelly clarkson album i have ever heard .
0	it is a good song , and the music video ha come out and it is great . i like the video alot . i would like to have the cd on cd .
0	this is a really good song . it is not my cup of tea but i like it .
0	i would have to say that this song is more of a dance song than a love song .
1	this song ha a very nice melody and great harmony . i like the way the song is played .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this song wa not really my cup of tea .
1	this set includes all of the recording for bolero by the legendary tenor , ernest ansermet .
1	i have not seen this much music on cassette for a very long time !
0	the band at the time of this recording wa a very different group than the one that played on this cd . i have not listened to this version before , but it is the only one that i have heard that ha a bass drum by james brown and a drummer in a more modern style . it is also the only version of this recording that includes any kind of trumpet , other than the one on the cd . the trumpet wa played by the same trumpeter who played the solo trumpet on the song tiger rag . at this time , james brown wa considered to be the greatest jazz trumpeter in the world .
1	this cover wa pretty good .
0	i like to listen to this cd on the way to work .
1	i love the song .
1	i love these song .
1	it is only a cd . but it is a good recording . this is a live gig , not a radio broadcast . it is just a cd and not a cd . it is a live recording . i do not know if i can give a good review but i will tell you that this is a good live recording of a live concert . it is not a radio broadcast because it is not broadcast . it is just not broadcast .
0	this is the worst song i have ever heard . i am going to buy the new cd .
0	i didn ` t like her voice much . she sings high pitched and her singing is not very natural .
0	mileys voice is amazing . she wa a beautiful singer and it is unfortunate that she is not around anymore .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	i have been waiting for this album for several year now . i have a collection of more than 10,000 song , and i have only listened to one album by the same artist . i now look forward to it every day .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	lareine is just a terrible song .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation

1	this is very good . i like it .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i really like this song !
0	i love this song . i love all the lyric , but the best thing about 4th of july is that it is a live show performance . i really enjoy the live show . it is a great song to listen to while driving . i can not think of a time i have listened to it on a long trip . i am sure it would make a great driving song . i would love to have a song like this on my car . i would love to have a live show performance like this on my car .
1	great album . the piano playing is great .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	( this song may be on the list of best of or favorite , but it is not my favorite . i do like the ending though . )
1	i love this song .
0	i love his music ! but this album is just boring .
1	this song is very good , but need to be heard to be believed .

1	the song , in the air is one of my favorite . i love the album and i really like the sound of it . i really enjoy listening to it .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	not bad . not great . just good .
1	i love it . so funny . i love the way it make you laugh , but also make you uncomfortable .
1	i love my i phone !
0	most of the song are very old . i would have given her a 5 star , had she gone on to write more song .
1	i love my new phone . it is great !
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this is a great cover of the original version . the original version is better , but this one is absolutely beautiful . if you do not care for the original , go buy the original or any gnr album to hear the original cover .
0	if this wasnt by a rock band , i would recommend it .
0	the song is really really really good
1	this cd is beautiful . it a very deep sound . it ha a nice background of sound .

0	i really like country music and this one is great .
1	i wa surprised by this album . i am a big fan of ennio morricone , but i did not know that his music did not belong to that category . this album is amazing . i just wish that the cd wa longer . it is a shame that on the track that are the same length like somewhere over the rainbow ( 3:43 ) , another song of the same length ( 3:05 ) ha been included .
1	this is definitely one of my favorite from the year . i have listened to it several time over the year . i am glad you put out another album .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i really like this album . i think that this album
0	this is jon lord first album . the album feature three different style of music , one of the most unusual being a song by jon lord titled the end of day . it is a very complex song that consists of an entirely different sound from his other song . the song is very , very slow , so there is not much variation in the song volume , but it is a lot of fun . i recommend listening to it on the first single . the second and third single are excellent song , but a little too slow for my taste .
1	i wa so excited to pick up this cd . i wa so excited to pick up this cd . i wa so happy . i wa so happy when i first heard this cd in my car . i wa so happy when i first heard this cd in my house . i wa so excited to know that this cd wa a christmas cd . i wa so very happy when i first discovered that this cd wa a christmas cd . i wa so very happy to find that this cd wa a christmas cd . i wa so happy that this cd wa a christmas cd . i wa so happy to discover that this cd wa a christmas cd .
1	i have listened so many time i lost count of how many time this song ha been on . i love the song so much . it is not only a great feeling good song , but it also ha a positive message . this guy wa a hero . i used to work in the hospital . i remember a lot of people dying in the hospital . it is sad to hear someone die due to lack of care .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
1	this is a great cover . i would recommend it .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i really like the song , but it is not what i would consider a hit - it is actually not very well known . i wish
1	this is one of the better version of this song . i think they really captured the spirit of the song .
1	this song is a great choice when you need to let your dog off the leash .
1	this album ha great song and a great production . i love this album .
1	i love the title . it is a catchy tune . the music is not very smooth . it is a little bit more subdued than the other tune in the cd . the vocal are also a little more subdued . i like that . overall , i like the song from this cd . i do not like the other song from this cd . some of the others are not very special . i also like that there are a lot of instrumentals in this cd . they are a little bit more interesting . i will listen to them all before i buy the other album .
1	i have been buying book from amazon for the last ten year . the cover art is always top notch . the music is always great . i can not remember the last time i bought anything that did not have great music . i will make good use of this book . thanks amazon .
1	i have listened to so many of her song and this album is the best by far . i really love the album and i think it is one of her best . it is a very good album .
1	tom scott is a top-notch jazz musician . his music is fresh , unique , and often inspiring . i am extremely excited to hear more from tom scott . he ha a great , unique style of jazz guitar playing that i enjoy .

1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i like the cd . i like the lyric , and the music is good . i enjoy the song , and the lyric .
0	i am so disappointed with this album . it sound like the band is trying to copy the sound of the band in the early 90 . the only thing good about this album is the song felt right .
1	i am a big fan of song that make me feel a certain way . this song make me feel warm and fuzzy .
1	i have listened to this cdr over and over and it is one of the best cdrs i have ever heard . i recommend this cd to anyone who is a fan of jazz .
1	this song is absolutely amazing . this is a great song .
1	this is a great album . there are a lot of great song on this album . one song in particular struck me and i did not put it on the blog . i had a roommate who did not like the song and the guitar player ( who i like to listen to ) had to stop playing the guitar to explain that the lyric were not appropriate for the audience and that i must have put the wrong song on the cd . i do not know why he had to stop playing the guitar , but it really wasnt that great for me . it doe not really matter though , because the band wa great . the song i walk with angel is a great song and is a very fitting way to end the cd . the band wa great and i really liked this cd .

1	this song is one of my favorite . i have been listening to music for over 20 year and i am still amazed that there are still so many great singer out there .
1	tom scott put out his own cd and he release them at least once a year . so , it is only natural that he should have a new cd out each year . he ha released several cd in the past , but his most recent effort , guitar world ha been a big hit .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i have listened to the first three track of this album and i must say they are not bad , it is just not what i expected . i am not sure how to describe it , but it is just not what i wa expecting . also , the other song are just great , it is just that one or two of the song are not a good a the rest . i will try to explain , but i will have to write about it . i am not sure what to do , i do not know how to interpret the album . it is not my type of music . i do not know how to make a record or how to make these type of song . i am not sure what to think . i am not sure what to say . i do not know what to think . i am not sure if i should just listen to it or not .
0	i bought this album on cd . i could not find any of the song on cd . it ha been a while since i have heard this album . i wa so excited to find the cd but when i did , the song are on there . if you wanted to buy this album on cd , you should have bought it on cd .

0	this sound a little like the version of the song with tom wait on it . it is a great song . i really liked this song . it ha great melody , great lyric , and it ha great instrumentation . i bought this cd thinking she could do no wrong . then i listened to the song with i can not get no satisfaction and i wa very disappointed .
1	very nice collection . i have seen the movie and this collection is better than the movie . the sound quality is good . the collection ha really good song . it is very beautiful . i really like the collection . i give it a 9/10 .
0	i think you can tell what this is about . it is about a woman who is a junkie . the more she us the drug , the more she want it . she ha no moral . she ha no goal . she ha no standard . she is nothing but a drug addict . i could put this one up next to the grateful dead song the eleven and you would not know the difference . i do not want to use this a an example of the grateful dead but i think it is a good example of the kind of music that come out of the grateful dead . this song is a classic .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i am a fan of the beatles , and i love this album .
1	i am a fan . this is a good song .
1	i love the original song by e.s.posthumus , but this version is much more impressive . the song on this cd are beautiful , and they sound great .
0	i love miley cyrus live . i like the song she is singing . her voice is amazing and her personality is great .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is the best song on the album . it is the best song from this album . i like it a lot .
1	if you like hard rock , and if you like the beatles , then this is the album for you . great lyric . great sound . great feel . great music . i would highly recommend this album .

1	i wa pleasantly surprised by this album ! jewel wa great on this cd , and i wa glad to see her back with another album . i wa very much looking forward to this cd , and i am very happy that i got it . i think this album wa a little better than the first , but still not great .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	it is so good , and it is her best album ever , and she is so good at singing , she make me cry and laugh , and i want to have a party with the song the last note .
1	this is the best record of reo speedwagon .
0	i would have to say that this cd is not a very good cd . i really like this cd . it is very good but it is not a very good cd . i will not buy it again .
1	this is a good album , but it is not a great album . it ha a lot of good music on it , and it make it easy to listen to , but it is not a great album . but that is beside the point . i have never been a fan of perry como , but i wa a fan of the perry como album that wa released after his death . i like the perry como album , and i like the new perry como album . i have liked every perry como album that wa released , but this one is my favorite . but this is not the perry como album i like . it is a little different than his other album . it is a little different than his last album . it is a little different than his first album . i like it a lot . it is a perry como album , and it is my favorite . but it is not my favorite perry como album . i think this album should be renamed , the perry como album , because it is not a perry como album . it is a perry como
0	i found this album on amazon , so i decided to try downloading it and i could not , it would pause and start over every time i tried to download it , i ended up deleting it , and then going and downloading the new album , but i am guessing this album is worth it .
1	i like the cd .
1	i love this song . i use it a a background when i talk to my friend in the car . i also like to listen to it when i am driving and not paying attention to what i am doing . it help me calm down and relax .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

0	i like the dave clark 5 song they did in the 1960s . they are very relaxing .
0	all good song here . some good punk rock , some great . overall , the only thing that bug me about this is the fact that i bought the whole collection and wasnt able to listen to the song in any order i wanted . i guess the problem wa that i only had a couple of hour to listen to it . i would still say that this is a good compilation , but not one that will be very popular with anyone except my music collection . i will stick with the other album . i liked the first one better . i think that this is an extremely good compilation , and i do hope that some one else will like it a well . i also hope that some one else will be a disappointed a i wa .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

0	this song wa really good . this song really got to me . i am glad i am not the only one who did not like it . i do not know if i can get past this album . it is like a bunch of song were put together to make a single . i do not know how i feel about this album . i just do not know what the point of it is .
1	this song is simply wonderful . i like the clean version better because it make it a little more lively .
0	this song is just a little too sweet and innocent for me .
0	i like tom wait but this song is just not tom wait . i do not know what else to say .
0	i am a big fan of david lee roth . i have been listening to his music since the early 90 . i can not say that i am a die hard fan , but i am not a casual fan either . i am a fan of the music and the song that he ha written . the other day i heard a song and wa blown away by the song , but at the same time i wa disappointed in what i heard . i have always liked the song , but i wa having trouble hearing the instrumentals on the song . all of the vocal were in the background with the instrumentals and the only time that i could actually hear the sound of the vocal wa when i turned the music up really loud . after i wa done listening to the song i wa not impressed and did not want to listen to the rest of the album . i just wanted to listen to the song . i am sure that it is a great song , but i am not impressed with the album that i listened to . my opinion is that the album is a very good album , but i give it a 3 star rating . i just do not like the way that the album sound .
0	this album contains a lot of the music of the movie fantastic voyage , including the choral piece , and the opening choral prelude .
1	this song wa one of the best song
0	if i could give this one star , i wouldve given it 3. this is an awful album . i am not a fan of bonnie tyler . the song are ok , but the music is awful . the worst part of the album is the vocal . i am not a fan of her singing voice . i am a fan of the song selection . it is nice to have a song that you love , but the album that i have listened to have been better than this one . the lyric are terrible , and i can not stand bonnie tyler . i am a fan of the pretender and i do not like her voice . this doe not even make the list of album i would give a 3-star rating . i can not imagine anyone buying this album . it is not worth the money .
0	this album wa not recorded in a studio . the band wa on a stage in an auditorium . the song are short and have very poor sound quality . the best song are from the first two or three . i am glad that i am not a reviewer who is suppose to review music i do not like . i am just giving my honest opinion . i like this album a lot .
1	this is a great collection of song . most of the selection are very beautiful and have a unique quality about them . the exception is i have got a brand new heart , and that is a shame . but you can hear the beauty in the rest of the performance which is why it is a very good album
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	this is one of the most creative album of 2011. the music is very unique and the video is awesome .
0	the biggest disappointment of this album is the song are not a good a the song on the two previous album . this album ha a lot of good song with good melody , but the song are not a good a the one on the previous two album .
0	i bought this album to listen to while working on my car . it wa the first album i bought from amazon.com . the review is good , the album is very good . this is a great album for the car audio enthusiast . i would recommend it to anyone who want to enjoy good music while driving . i would rate it 4.5 out of 5 star . i also bought a cd of george harrison solo rendition of my sweet lord and that one wa also very good .
1	i would like to buy this cd but i will not be able to because i do not have the money .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i wa wondering how i could get on to this . i wa not surprised , and i am very happy with it . this is a big seller , and i expect to keep it in it top 10 seller for some time to come . i have always been a fan of jan garbarek , and i expect to hear more of this band .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	she ha a pretty good voice .
0	it is like a watered down version of a song i like . it is like a watered down version of a song i like . i do not know what to say about this . it is like a watered down version of a song i like , yet it is got a much better arrangement . i do not like the song . it is just a watered down version of a song i like , yet it is a much better version . i do not know what to say about this . it get better with every listen to it , yet it is got a watered down version of a song i like . i do not like the song and i do not like the version they have played on the cd . it is a watered down version of a song i like , yet it is a watered down version of a song i like .
0	i can not believe i can now get this cd on my ipod !
1	this song make me cry every time i hear it .
0	i am always excited to see what happens with this band . i like the song , i love the band , but the lyric are a little much to me , and i am not sure i like the video .
0	the first cd had an interesting selection of song , but the second cd is just a bunch of song i have heard , and never liked .
0	this is a must have for any fan of reo speedwagon
1	i love the music of lorde and i like them on facebook .
0	i am not really a big fan of this song , but i like the cover very much .
1	this book is amazing . the story is filled with so many interesting fact and it make you want to learn more about country music . it is a must read for anyone who love country music , regardless of age . it is a must read for anyone who ha ever loved country music . i love reading book about country music because they are always so interesting . it ha made me want to know more about the music , and it ha made me want to learn more about the people who are really responsible for the music . i have enjoyed many different book about country music , and this one is the most fun . the history and background is fascinating .
1	i like this
0	this doe not have a good beat , but it doe have a good feel .
0	barbra is a great singer and i like this album .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i am very pleased with the quality of the recording .
0	this wa a live recording from a local band called the shred . all i can say is that this band sounded like they played in their hometown . the song shred wa very short and played on a drum machine and guitar . i did not think anything of it at first , until i heard the lyric . they were really good . not only wa the sound quality good , but the lyric were very good . the song wa about how a person can be a great friend and a great enemy . they were pretty good . the lyric i hear most are about how much a person care for people . maybe not the best lyric , but they were very good .
0	i liked the album . i liked the cd .
0	i wish i could find a better song/video to show my husband and son . i do not think any of the song on this list are great
0	this is a great album for the early fall . i bought this for my 8 year old son and he enjoyed it very much . i bought it for my four year old daughter and she enjoyed it . i bought it for my two daughter and they loved it also . i bought it for my wife and she enjoyed it also . i bought it for my husband and he enjoyed it also . this is a great cd for the fall . - you are the best thing i have ever done - thank you for the life you gave me - you are the best thing i have ever done
0	i got this album for free on the first day of the cd release . i have been a fan of the clash ever since i wa nine year old . i wa very surprised when i found out this album wa a re-release of the original album . i wa blown away ! the album cover is pretty but i think the cover art for the re-release is better . i have been listening to this album for hour . it is a good mix of punk , reggae , heavy metal and a touch of funk . the singing is incredible . it is very good quality but i do not think they should have released this a a re-release . the original album wa pretty good but i think it lack in the production .
0	this is the third song in the album , and i do not know if it wa a favorite of beethoven , but this song fit the beethoven theme . it is a good song , but i am not so sure about the instrumentation and the vocal .
1	i bought the song because i thought it
0	i do not understand why people hate the song .
1	this song is great , with the exception of the ending . it is really good , i love the beat , but the ending is quite annoying . i do not like it .

1	i really like this cd . i like the song no hand very much . i do not know why , but i like bruno mar . i like the song no hand . i think the song no hand is one of the best song bruno mar ha ever written .
0	this is a collection of four song that i picked up at a garage sale . i love the artwork and the song were enjoyable and i wa happy to find that they were available on cd in this format .
1	lorde doe this song justice . lordes voice and style are just so unique and beautiful .
1	the first one to come on my ipod , from the karajan label . i could not get over the fact that there wa no album on this cd , but it wa only a single disc . very fine recording , with great playing and a very pleasant sound quality . the stereo mix is also a pleasant surprise , and the album track is actually a good song .
0	i listened to this album a lot while growing up , but i can not remember if i ever bought it , or if someone gave it to me . i think i wa about 11 , maybe 12 , so i can not be very sure , but i certainly remember liking the song .
1	i think the band did a great job with this . they covered i need a man and i think it is also a great cover . the band is great and the sound of the band is good . i really like the band .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i downloaded this cd to get a taste of the new single i am not there by the new pornographer . the song , at least to my ear , sound like a song by the who . i have no desire to buy the cd and have no interest in listening to it . i will probably stop reading this review before i finish it . my comment are about the song itself . i can not hear the bass or the drum . the vocal are ok , but i do not like the way they sound . they are very distorted and have a very nasal sound . i would have preferred a recording that had a fuller sound .

1	i really like the song . i love this great song . i love this song . i love this song . i love brandy .
1	this is the only song i listen to while i am in church . the lyric are powerful and the music is beautiful .
0	i like this set , and the reason i like it is because i have been listening to the recording of this repertoire for 40 or more year now . i have heard all of these recording many time . i can not think of any other recording that compare to them .
0	i like this band a lot , but their album have become more and more repetitive . this is a good record but the song are very predictable and the song are not all very long
1	i love the song i can not stand it , however , i wish it wa on the first album . the album is a little boring overall , but the
0	i have listened to this cd several time . it is a great recording . i like all the song on it . this is a great cd . i wish there were more album by john williams . i am a fan of johnny cash and john williams . i also like johnny cash .
0	i thought it wa a great song !
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i purchased this cd for my daughter . it wa easy to put together and it came in a pretty nice package .
1	i love dave clark five . i have a great respect for the group and i wa very impressed by their music . i own many cd by them and this cd is a very high compliment to their music . the cd wa well worth the money . i wish you all the best .

0	the sound on this cd is really good . i do not think it wa their best recording , but it is okay . i mean , they could have been better .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i love this album . i love all the song on this album . i wa looking for a different type of album .
0	this cd is excellent - i have listened to it several time and i love the guitar solo .
1	the best song on the album by far !

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	largest collection of electronic music !
1	i like to listen to this song .

1	the quality of the recording is great . i like the high quality of the stereo . i have not heard the cd yet but it is on itunes .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	just bought this album and am enjoying it a lot more than i thought i would . i wish i could hear more of the song i like the most . i will probably buy the next album .
0	not my favorite . but it is ok. i do not like the lyric .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .

0	i have always been a fan of this song from the movie the notebook . i love it and i like it a lot ! i downloaded it to my phone and it is still not fully downloaded . it wa a waste of my money .
0	she sings very well .
1	the opening is a perfect example of the type of song that would make a great country-pop song . the lyric are also superb . it is a shame this old man is not mentioned on the cover . the harmony are excellent .
1	i had no idea that sam sparro had so much talent . this is one of his best album . the song black and gold is the best part . till the end is a great song and crazy love is a good song , too .
1	i find this album very interesting and i like the title of the song .

0	this is one of the most boring cd i ever purchased . i thought that this cd wa supposed to be a gospel album . it is not even close . i can not stand e.s . posthumus . i do not like his music . i like much better music like donnie hathaway , the temptation , and marvin gaye . i do not know why he had to have jesus , or the lord , in his name . i feel like i am listening to a parody of himself . no offense to anyone , but i am an old woman , and i want someone to give me a god , i love you cd .

0	i have been listening to this tape every day for about a week now , and i like it . it is relaxing and also a very good way to unwind when you need to .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	this is a very good cd . it is very disappointing that it doe not live up to the music . i have listened to it a few time and each time i think to myself , i should listen to something else . it make me sad that i do not like it . i have nothing against tom scott , but i do not like his music . i do not like his cd . i think this cd is just average .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i have found this cd very good . it is a very slow christian music cd that is full of great music . i love this cd and i want to buy this cd again .
0	the album is for all age . it ha an awesome selection of song , with different genre within those genre . the mix is great a well . i think the mix is better than the album . i wish they would have stuck with that mix . the album is a great mix of genre and can be played on any of your ipod ( the mix is great ) . the album is great for the age . the song are for all age .
1	i love the dave clark five .
1	i love all the song on this album and this is an amazing album . it is really good .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i am a sucker for song with an intro and outro , that is all , except for distant drummer and i am on fire ( on which i am a sucker ) .
0	this album is pretty much the same album , except for a few new song , and a couple of single , of song from the previous album , which i thought sounded a little more commercial . it is a good album , but you can not really tell if it is for a band or a solo artist , since they both sound the same . still , if you like a band you should buy this album , if you like a solo artist you should buy this album .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

1	oh my god , i am so glad i found this album . it ’ s so beautiful . like a dream you can ’ t wake up from because you know something inside you will make you wake up . ( i am a musician , i think i know what i ’ m doing ) i wish i had found this album age ago . thank you john . you ’ re an inspiration .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this song ha a great beat and sound .
1	i wa about 12 or 13 year old when i first saw this song . my mother had just returned from a long trip and i wa in the kitchen doing my homework when the song came on the radio . it wa playing in a jukebox in the cafe and the lyric were about the bus ride she had taken . i never knew that the song wa about a woman , but i do now . her name wa mary and she wa the love of my life . i loved her and she loved me and i will always love her . to this day i can never find a word she did not say when she wa around me . i think she wa born on the 29th of october . i have always loved music and would like to thank whoever put this song on the internet . i think it is one of the best song ever . please someone put it on the internet !

1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .

0	i love the oldie , but this cd wa a mistake . very cheap and poorly done . the vocal sound like a drunk woman rambling on . i only got half way through and thought i would not like it . i never will again .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

0	i love this album . the music is enjoyable , you can find yourself humming tune like it is your own .
1	this is one of the best song barbra ever recorded .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this album is great and the song are very catchy , i am very glad that i bought this album .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e s posthumus . i play it all the time , and i have been looking for a cd like this ever since .
1	i love that she sings about the feeling i get when i am with a girl .
1	this song is one i really dig . it is an upbeat , up tempo , feel-good song . i like how it is very upbeat and very happy without being too happy . the opening verse is very pleasant and easy to listen to . the verse are nice and easy to follow . the chorus is very nice with an upbeat tempo . the chorus is nice . it is upbeat and not too happy . it is a good song .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	i just got my copy of this . i love the music on this album . the worship song are great . i like the other song , but the worship song are my favorite . i am not a fan of the vocal , but the music is good . i agree with the negative comment . this cd is not for everyone . in fact , it is not for everyone . i have heard of some people that hated the vocal , and it is a matter of personal taste . if you like the music , then you will like this music . if you hate the vocal , then you will not like this cd .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	tom wait is not here , but the band ha a great stage presence , and they sounded great . the music wa good and the sound quality wa decent .
1	this album is amazing . the music is very good , and the vocal are very good . i will buy this album .
0	just bought this song . i like this song . i really like it . it is very catchy and a great song .
0	the album is okay , but the lyric and music are too generic .
1	not a bad cd . it is just that the producer production is so bad . i can not even understand what he is doing . i do not know why he doe it , but it is not good . i am going to burn it
0	i really like this album , a lot of good stuff . it is just what i want . i wish i could get the album in mp3 .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i am glad i bought this cd . it is great to get a second chance to listen to a song i have already heard . it is cool to know it is not a complete waste .
0	it is a good album . not my favorite but good . i like the beatles a lot . i prefer their album to their single .
1	a good version with a great arrangement .
1	i really like this song and have had it since i first heard it . it is a great song . i like it on the cdr . i have had it for a couple year now . i really like it . the only thing i think could be improved is the vocal . they are not bad , but they could be better .
0	i like this cd , but i think it is a better cd than many of the others in this category . the cd is a good collection of song , but i would not buy this cd .
0	i am a fan of the band . however , i do not like the music they have become . they are just like the rest of the band that are out there . i would have rather seen them do something different . the song are just not good . and the band seems to be changing their sound now . they do not have the gut to stand out and try new thing .
1	this is not exactly my cup of tea but i love it . i love their song and i love singing this album . plus i love the fact that it is got a little bit of everything in song from all over the world .
1	this song ha been a great help to me . it make me feel good and it make me feel like i am doing the right thing .
0	the lyric and the melody are so old-fashioned . that doe not mean that the song is bad . i am going to like it more after i have heard it more .
0	i downloaded the cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like using the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i would not recommend this cd .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	i do not have that many album by barbra streisand , but this one is one of my favorite . she sings the song with her usual good voice , and it is not just a cover , but a great one .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i have heard this song played live , but then i have also heard this song played on the radio , and i have also heard this song played on the radio , and on several different cd collection . so it is not the same song .

1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	she can do whatever she want . she sings different type of song . i like her voice . i want to hear her sing more .

1	i like that this song is an oldie , and it is a good song .
0	the music is great and the lyric are not bad , but the sound is terrible .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i received a message saying that the file i wa downloading did not connect to the internet . i am sure that i did not do anything wrong , but i do not know how to fix it .
1	bonnie is an awesome singer . she is a little on the old side , but i like that . i like the diversity of the song on this album . they are fun and unique .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i love the song . i have a collection of her music . i love her music .
0	fantastic song and video . i love the video , but the song is just incredible . it is a song that take you out of the world a little bit .
0	i have been a fan of this band for almost 20 year . i thought this cd wa one of the best of the year . it sound like they are trying too hard . and to make matter worse , the word are written in the wrong order . i bought this because i had heard that the band new album wa very good . i wa disappointed .
0	she doe not sing all the time like she did on the last album ; however , she doe the vocal better here .
1	i do not think i have ever heard this song , but i agree with the other reviewer . it is a very good song !
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i would recommend this cd to anyone that like jazz and music in general . i really enjoy this cd and i will buy it again .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	she ha an incredible voice !
1	this is one of my favorite song . i first heard this song at radiate 2012. it wa one of the most popular song . i liked the song so much that i started playing it at my house . the first time i heard the song at a concert , i wa at nantes france where i wa so impressed . the first time i heard this song at a wedding , i wa in the hotel room and it wa so peaceful .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i am glad i can now listen to this great cd and have a new album for the time being .

1	this song is not my favorite , but i loved it !
1	this cd is a good cd . it
1	i bought this on my birthday . i thought it wa a great song . i did not expect it to be like the song i have heard . it wa good , but not a good a the song i heard .
0	i really really like this song . my daughter thought it wa cute . she liked the chorus and thought the melody wa nice . my son thought the chorus wa cute .
1	great album ! great trance album !
0	i love this song . i have it on my mp3 player and i love it . i can not figure out how some people can sing this . there is no way i can sing it . i love it when i sing it . i love it on the radio .
0	this is an old school album of praise and worship . most of the song are very familiar and not new . the song are not very good . not worth the money .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	what is in a name ? a lot . this is an album that is about so much more than just the song alone . this cd is a collection of song that is a tribute to the past . it is about her own past , and how she see the world through it . this album is about the past . this album is about her and her past . it is about her memory . she ha a tendency to include very personal detail in her lyric , but this is not a personal album . this album is about the past and how it is portrayed on the record .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	this is an amazing collection . i would recommend it to anyone who love fat waller .
1	i would love to have it a the first song on my playlist , it is a beautiful song but i do not think i will be able to listen to this song a lot .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i like it .
0	this cd is awesome . i listen to it every day , when i have time .
0	this is my favourite album . it is great to listen to and not have to be bored with it . lareine is a very talented and intelligent woman . i love her work .
0	i agree . this album is awful . i do not recommend anyone to buy this album . the lead singer is not a gifted singer . it is a terrible album and i do not understand why people buy this album .
1	i love mileys voice , i like how she sings .
1	i like her song . i have listened to many of her song . she may be the best .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	i just love this karajan version . i think this is the best original version of the song i have ever heard .
1	i love her voice . i love all the lyric , but especially i do not wan na be alone and i wan na tell you . i love the album cover , and the album cover make a great counter-cultural statement . i love the album cover and the album cover make a great counter culture statement .
0	this is one of those album that i would recommend to a friend of mine . i do not know if it is good or not , but it is one of those album that i would recommend to a friend . it ha a good sound , and i like the music . it is one of those album that i would recommend to a friend of mine .
1	i have a song called paint the town and this is my favorite song from that album . it just really make me feel good to know that i am really not alone in my thought and it make me feel good to know that i am not the only one with problem .
1	well see if this is bonnies best . i am sure there are some good track , but i am not sure about it being her best . it is difficult to say one is one best and the other is not .
0	an enjoyable album . but the backing track is a bit too much - the string sound too good to be from a recording , and there are no real drum , so this is a bit like listening to the band playing a tape and not a band in the band .
1	i think it is a fairly accurate depiction of the world we live in , a little bit depressing at time . but i think it is a pretty good representation of the world we live in .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	i feel this song is very well written , and the video is great a well .
1	i love this song and i love the simple melody . this is by far my favorite on the list . i would say it is a great song for a child to sing to their parent .
0	i purchased this cd to get my voice ready for a singing competition . i am not going to waste it . i would not recommend this cd .
0	this album is not a christian album ! the only christian song on this album are the song that the artist ha added . the rest of the song are completely commercial and have nothing to do with the gospel . you buy this album and listen to it , and you will be bored . i would not recommend this album to anyone .
0	i love hearing the song of the master . i am always glad when i get a new cd from a great artist . this cd is no exception . it is a wonderful mix of jazz and swing . this cd is worth the purchase .
0	this is a great song and i love mileys voice !
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this is an ok song . you got ta give credit to the band for this song . it wa the same for me , so i give it 2 star .
0	i don ` t like this song at all . it is not very good .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i love this cd , i am giving it to my sister a a christmas present .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	a great artist . i do not know how he doe it . this is a really good piece of art .
1	i have only heard the cd a couple of time , but i like it . i am looking for a cd to listen to while watching football .
1	this is my favorite bonnie tatum album . i wish i could afford to buy a cd copy of all of her album a i love them all . and , yes , this is the first bonnie tatum album i have heard .
1	the cd is very well produced . it ha really good sound . the cd is fun to listen to and it ha a great message . the song are very nice and the cd is very well produced . i will be buying this cd .
0	i really hope this album is a joke . i have had the cd for about a half hour and already wish i had not bought it . there is so much wrong with it . the vocal are so bad that i can not even listen to them . the song selection is very disorganized . the instrumentation is terrible . the production is so bad that it is hard to believe that it wa made in 2006. the lyric are so atrocious . the melody are just plain bad . all in all , i find it hard to listen to this album without thinking about how much bad music it is . and all because of the fact that the recording is so terrible .
1	the original wa not on youtube , and i wa looking for it for some time .
1	i love this song . it is an awesome pop song , and sam sparro is a talented musician . the song fit the theme of the album a well a the album title . it is a great , great song . i really like this song .
0	i wa looking for this cd , but i got the cd and i liked it . i listened to the other album , but not this one . the lyric are pretty , so it is a good cd . the album ha a unique sound . the lead vocal are not what they should sound like . the lead vocal are weak . i did not like the way she sings . she is not a great singer . i love the song i am an artiste . i would like if she sang this in a different way . i want to listen to her original song . i would like to hear her sing at her best . i have heard her live , they sound great . they do not sound like the cd . they are not even close . this is a mediocre cd .
0	i think this show is really informative and it seems like they are doing something different and interesting . every week they have a different topic . i liked this show .
1	this song doe not remind of anything i know . it is like a song that is a mix between the old , and the new .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this is great . i have listened to this on my ipod , ipod touch and ipod nano . the piano is great .
0	this is from the same band , but this is a video recording of the band performing the song . it is a video and not a live recording . i have heard this song , but it is not included in the new album .

0	i can not believe that is by the beatles . i do not care about the song or who sang it . the beatles are no longer a group . they are dead . they will never make another album . you either like them or you do not . i am sure there are a few people who like them . but i do not . i like other band . i like a lot of band . i like the new wave of band . i like the band from the 70 like the beatles , simon and garfunkel and the police . i do not like this dreck . it is not the beatles . the beatles are dead . they are not going to make another album . they are not going to make another album . it is over . it is a total waste of time . i will probably buy it anyway . it will probably be a bunch of filler song that no one really care about .

1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	i have listened to this album a few time and i have to say , i really enjoy it . i have heard an occasional song from this recording but this is my favorite .
0	i had no idea this wa even a real song until i read the lyric on amazon . i guess i am not the only one . this is a real song . david lee roth is a real singer . it is about a woman who is being raped , and the two men responsible are going to go to jail . i do not know how this is going to happen , but it is happening . david lee roth sings about being a rapist , and his victim are going to have to pay for their sin . i can not believe this is real , but it is . for all the wrong reason . it is even worse than it sound . i do not know if i am going to order this from amazon or wait for them to update it . it sound like it is going to be a good song , but i just do not believe in it realness . i am not sure why they put this on here . i guess i do not like david lee roth , but i do not like the way this is being sold online . it is a real song , and i am glad it is here .
0	this album ha been a mainstay in my car for a while . i have listened to this album in my car while driving . it is a great sounding album .
0	i have enjoyed her music for a long time . i like her song for the most part . my problem is with this album . the only reason i bought it wa because i enjoyed her music . what a waste of time and money .
1	this is the best album i have heard in a long time . it is the same thing that the band is about- a sound that i have heard many time before but never really understood until i heard it with my own ear . the only negative thing about this album is that it is two and a half hour long . that is fine , though , because i can listen to it in one sitting .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i have heard her on radio station , but i have never had the chance to hear her live .
1	i have never been satisfied with any recording and the sound is quite remarkable . it is quite clear , you can hear every one of the note , and you can move your head to listen to the other instrument . sound like they had a professional engineer go over the recording and made them clearer .
1	this is another great album . i would like to hear more from lareine .
0	this song wa ok. the movie wa better .
1	i wa listening to this cd last night . i wa amazed at how the sound wa . i like the way the sound wa when the piano played the first few note . then the sound got much better . that is what i like about the recording ( not the sound ) . i really liked the second and third recomends . i liked all of the recomends .
0	cd wa excellent . i will give it a rating of 4 star . i am happy with the song selection .
1	love the song
0	i wa hoping to find a solid pop album . this is exactly the type of album i wa hoping to find .
0	this album wa the most amazing album that i have ever heard . i will admit , i wa very skeptical when i first heard this album because i wa not sure it wa going to be a good a i remembered . i wa surprised at how good this album really is . the song are all very different and it is not repetitive at all . the song are very well written and the band is really tight . the music is very smooth and very listenable . i really enjoy listening to this album because it is so different . i have even put this on my ipod .
0	not the same song on the movie . still i like the movie version way better - even tho the movie version is the superior one .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this song made me feel happy . it had a great beat and it hit hard .
1	i have never heard this concert , but i am a huge fan of prince . i wa very excited to get this cd because i had heard about it for so long . this is not a perfect recording , and i do not think it is the best sound . what is it like to have people who are screaming and cheering in the background ? how about the crowd noise or the people in the background ? it is really hard to hear . what is it like to put this on after a concert ? i would have paid good money for this . i got it for free . i do not think it is the best version , but it is very good . i would give it a 5 star rating .
1	this is another one of these album that ha a very good flow to it . however , it is only 5 song , but it ha a good variety of song and a good variety of style . i like this album very much .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	very well played song .
0	this album is good .
0	the only reason i give this 5 star is to let you know that i have tried it . i like to try new thing . this is a really good cd . i give it 5 star .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	i am a big fan of this artist and have been wanting to hear this cd for a long time but not sure i wa going to get it . i am very disappointed .
1	i have heard a lot of e.s . posthumus recording and this is by far my favorite . m.b .
0	i really enjoy this song so much that i bought the entire collection , including heartbreaker ( which i have not listened to yet ) . i actually like this song and have no idea why it wa removed . i love the vocal and the guitar is fantastic . it really reminds me of something i heard in a movie . i do not know what it is or where it is from . it is a great song .
0	this album is definitely an eye opener . i really enjoyed hearing the instrumentals and the vocal . the vocal are powerful , the lyric are powerful and the music is powerful . this album is very different from everything i have heard before . i will definitely be buying more work from the band .
1	i wa looking forward to this album . it is really good . i like sam sparros black and gold album . this is a great song . it is different from sam sparros live in concert album . i think the sound is great . i do not know why this ha not been released , and i would love to have it . i would rate it highly because it is a fun song . i have listened to it before , and it is great . i would rate it a 4/5 .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i love this song but it is sad to think that it will be playing for year to come on the radio . i am really disappointed that the kid and young people who buy this album are not going to get the message .
1	this is the one album that i can not say enough good thing about . i really love this album . this is the one album that i can not say enough good thing about , this is the
1	sound like an old country song but with newer production . it doe not sound like anyone else . it is a very simple song , and it is pretty easy to sing along with . worth the listen .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i like this album . it is great .
1	i always love mariah carey . this song is so romantic , and it ha the most beautiful melody . i love it . i like whitney houston a lot , but i do not like this song . it is not a good a her other song . it is a little too sad and not a good a her other song . i am glad that whitney houston is still alive . i will miss her . i am glad her album are still out there . i am glad that she is still touring . i wish she could still be around for my kid to see .
0	it is an album of great song , and my favorite song . i do not like you have got to be kidding . i do not know who sings that . i do not like the lyric either , but i have got to go is an okay song . i think the album is overall pretty good . i like the song i will be waiting a lot , but not the rest of the song . i would like to hear more about it someday .
1	i love this album . i really do . it is a very good album . it is not a great album , but it is a very good one . i really do not understand why this album is not more popular . i am really glad i waited for this one . it sound great . i love the music and i hope it will sell a many copy a possible .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i just purchased this cd . the first song i listened to wa some good year and it wa wonderful . i loved all the song , but i really liked the song some good year . there is something special about the song and the harmony which sounded great to me . i thought it sounded like the kind of song barbra would write . i think the album is good and i will probably purchase the cd when i am able to purchase it .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	the last song he said he wasnt wa a very good song , but i could not help but be disturbed by it . when i wa listening to the song at work someone interrupted it to say that they thought the lyric were very sexist . i wa appalled by this and i wa so hurt by it , i could not listen to the song anymore . i can not believe for a second that someone thought it wa okay to say that . i am glad this is only a sample of the negative review that amazon have received . i wa so disappointed when i found out that the song had been pulled from the website . i am hoping they will change their mind .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i like this song . it is not a country a other song i have heard , but it is not country either . i like the harmony .
0	this is the worst hammond album ever . i hate how they made this . there are no good song on this album . the production is awful . the vocal are boring and the production is horrible . if you do not like the song the time is right , then you may want to skip the album .
0	i do not have to say this but , he is a very good artist and ha a good voice . very nice .
1	a great album to listen to . i really like it .
0	just listened to the song . it is a great song , but it is very hard to sing . it is very difficult to sing without any word to sing . the song is truly wonderful .
1	i have bought this cd , and i think it is a great cd .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i love this cd . this cd is not to be missed . you have to play it all the time you hear it . the song are great , and the vocal are not bad , either . i would recommend this cd for anyone to listen to .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this is a great album ! i love the music from this band . i love the song on this cd .
1	i like this cd and i bought it at a reasonable price . i like it a lot . it is a nice upbeat song .
1	i am a big fan of de la soul . i listen to it on repeat in my car , and once in a while while i am driving , i will blast a whole album just to feel his influence . this album is full of the same kind of energy , and i love every minute of it . the production is great . the music is great . i love how the whole album is a little bit of this , a little bit of that , and a little bit of everything . from the hip hop inspired verse to the ambient music , it is all here .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is the first cd i have ever heard by this band . i liked the album title , and i like the album cover on this album .
1	this cd is better than the cd i got a a gift one year ago .
0	i bought three of these cd for my daughter . i know they will love them . it is a good album .
1	this album ha been the only beatles album i have listened to . this is amazing and i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	this song is a good rocker . it is a pretty good song with a very good chorus .
0	her voice is very nice , but it sound like she is singing through a tube , not a microphone . the song are good and the lyric are okay .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	not the movie version , but the original version of the song is not the same .
1	i think that i like the album but i like this song and i like the music video and i think that i like the album .
0	i wa pleasantly surprised and delighted with this cd . it ha a good selection of grateful dead song . at time the sound quality is somewhat lacking . the only con is the shipping cost .

1	this is an oldie , and i liked the track . it is a good song to dance to .
1	a a fan of david bowie , i wa thrilled when i saw that david bowie album , the next day , wa available for digital download . i wa even more thrilled when i saw that the album wa available on the itunes store . however , i wa disappointed to find that bowie album wa available through itunes only , and not through the digital download option found on amazon . i found a few song on itunes , but i am not sure they are available in the online download section . i wa disappointed ; but still very much looking forward to the digital download option .

1	his music is beautiful and very personal . i love the way he make his music .
1	a collection contains the top song from the movie jurassic park by steven spielberg . all the track are great and the only one that i do not like is boned because of the loud trumpet .

1	this song ha been on my mp3 player for a while now , and i really like it . i am glad i bought it .
0	this album is a real testament to the dave clark five . you have to dig deep into your heart to find a song that doe not have a great guitar solo by paul humphreys . the song selection is awesome . i have listened to this album over and over again . they are great musician !
1	i am in love with this album ! this album is one of the best one i have ever heard . my favorite bonnie song is all alone with something to say . i wish i could find a copy that i could play in the car , though . it would be great to have an autographed copy of this album in my car .
0	the guitar riff are great , and the song is very catchy . i don ’ t like the lyric though . i like this song , but i don ’ t like the song . i don ’ t think i have ever listened to this song and liked the song , so it may be just me .
0	i have been a fan of the beatles since my first exposure to them in 1967 when i saw them in liverpool , and i have been a fan of their album ever since . i wa a regular in the beatles fan club , and i played many beatles song in my early band . the beatles were already one of my favorite group , and i have been a fan of them ever since . they are the greatest group in the world , and this album is fantastic .
0	i found this on the cd player of my car . it wa played a lot and i just like it a lot . i love hearing this in the car . when i first heard this i wa on acid and i could not even believe it wa by the velvet underground . i thought it wa a one time thing . it wa released on the same day a the ramones album but i did not know that at the time . i still do not know that at the time . i have a lot of song that i love to listen to in the car , this song ha been on the radio so many time it is a constant .

1	this song is very catchy and the beat is very good . it make me want to dance to it .
0	i do not like this album . i have heard it twice , both time i did not like it .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	gay-trance is a very good album , but i believe that is because i have always believed that the best music in the world is the music of the 60 and 70 ( and not the music of today ) . i have listened to many album of today and they are not nearly a good a the music of the 60 and 70 .
1	i have this recording on cd . i love this recording in the same way that i love all of karajans music .
0	i heard the dave clark five play on the radio , but i knew nothing about them . i liked it , so i bought the cd .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this song make me want to cry .
1	i am a big fan of this album . there are not any bad song on this album , just two . i give it a 4 because the production is good , the song are good , and there are fun song to listen to . i give it a 5. i give it a 4 because the production is good and the song are pretty decent .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy idid , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take youback to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! loveit ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	keith side is a great singer but he doe not write song . while this disc is good , it is not a great album . some of the song are good , but they are not a good a the keith side discography . the album is quite repetitive and some of the music is a little too predictable . it is just not a great disc .
0	this band is pretty good . it ha some good song , and i like it .
0	i wa first introduced to this song when i wa around ten year old . i actually thought it wa by r & b diva , but i do not know which one . i have never heard it before , so this is probably a first .
0	this is not a good song . this is a terrible song . i do not like it .

1	i love the song on this album . i have had several of her cd and this is currently the best . one song i did not like wa the end of day which is the best song on this album . i am very happy to find this on the internet .
0	this is one of the most underrated song on the album . it is not a good a what is the use of living . but it is still a great song .
1	i have been looking for something to write a review about for awhile . this is finally it . it is an old , old song , and the lyric are pretty much what i expected . i would like to think i would have enjoyed this song if i had the chance to hear it in the 80 . so let u start off with the positive :
1	this song get me through my day .
0	i wa so disappointed with this album i could only listen to it when i wa alone . i found this album to be very dissapointing . it sound like it wa made in a hurry and not very serious about the sound .
1	this is very relaxing and soothing . i bought this because i wa tired of having to listen to the same song over and over again without really enjoying it . i am very happy with this purchase . it is very relaxing and sound good .
1	this song is great . it is very different from the rest of the album . it is very different from most of the song . this song is amazing . this song rock . this song rock . this song rock . this song rock . this song is great . this is a great song . this is a great song . i love this song . this song is great . this song make me feel good . this song make me feel good . this song make me happy . this song make me happy . this song make me feel good . this song make me want to live . this song make me want to live . this song make my heart feel good . this song make my heart feel good . this song make me want to live

1	i love this song , but i can not understand how it got on there for me . it is beautiful . it wa very nice to hear it again .
0	i believe that there are many , many people who have heard e.s . posthumus , but not all of them will listen to the cd . i like it , and i am glad i bought it . it is a good cd .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i have two kid and they are both growing up , which mean that i have to be able to listen to music that they can relate to . i have listened to a lot of christian music , but had yet to come across anything that i felt wa christmas music . this is such a wonderful album .
1	i like this cd and the sound quality is great . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like jazz and can not get enough of jazz .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time

1	i first saw this cd when i wa a sophomore in college and i had the privilege of sitting in on a concert by this outstanding performer . i wa impressed by her talent and talent and wanted to take her to the next level of performance . she is still a student of the art and i am very happy that she is using her talent to promote it to those who have never heard of it .
0	this is a great song however there are too many note and not enough melody in this song . not to mention the constant strumming and tapping . the note are off and you sound like you are trying to sing with only one finger . i have had to stop listening to this song because of this . i would not recommend this song to anyone

1	this band seems to be the most original band on the radio . i love the song . i am happy i got this album .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .

0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .

1	it is great . i like it and i like it a lot . i am surprised i have never gotten this album for free .
1	this is a great album that ha more than one gospel song on it . i listened to this album about three time this week , and i am really enjoying it . if you like contemporary christian music , i think you will like this album . i have a couple of favorite song on it , but it is not a perfect album . i would still like to listen to this album again and again , and i would recommend you do the same .
1	this piece of music is very relaxing and soothing . it is uplifting and make me feel very relaxed .

1	i enjoy this album . it is a good album although it doe not have any song that i would rank higher than the rest of the album . the one that i think is the best song is the song i will take care of you which is a great song . i like the other song on this album but they are not a great a the song that i like the best . this is a good album that if you like sinatra , bing , dean , or any other singer then this is a good album .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	this is a very good album . there are a few song that are repetitive on this album but it is all good . it is a good album and i like the song on this album . i would recommend this album to any fan of band from the seventy .
0	i have listened to all of your cd except the last one . that wa just so terrible i had to give it to the neighbor .

0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this is not a good song . i do not even like it , it sound like a bad song .
1	this is a good album if you like hammond and steve morse .

0	i do not like this band at all . they are just so unimaginative and boring . they are just okay . i can only hope that they do something better next time .
1	i love this song so much . it is one of the best blue song ever made .
1	i have always been a fan of the music of gwen moore and her song some good year is one of the only song that i have ever really loved . this is not a cover song , it is original and it wa written by gwen moore and her husband , randy moore .

0	lareines music is very popular in japan . but this music is not very good . the lyric are all the same , and the music is very boring and same old . i think this is a bad cd .
0	what a joy to discover this compilation . it is an excellent compilation of ansermets recording . the playing is excellent for the most part and the sound engineer make mistake that ruin the experience . i would have liked to have had a sound engineer that wa a little better than what i had .

1	this is a great song ! i love the lyric and the music .
1	i like this cd . it ha a nice mix of old and new song . it is a bit of a mixed bag . it ha old-school and contemporary song mixed together . some of the song are good , but they do not really stand out from the others . some of the song have a feel that make them stand out . it is not a bad cd , but it doe not have that wow factor . it is just kind of average . the only standout song is praise be the lord , which is a really good song . other song do not really have that wow factor . i love song like praise be the lord , praise , and praise is what i do . i really like the song that are upbeat song , but they do not stand out a much . the song that are slow and quiet song do not really have that wow factor . i think this cd is good , but i think i will be buying it again .
0	i think lareines voice is great . he ha a pretty good voice , but sometimes it sound a bit too deep for me . i have always liked his voice , but i like a lot of people voice that are deeper . i like a lot of people voice that have a lot of vibrato . i really like his voice because it doe not sound too deep , which is what i like when i listen to other people voice . i have a problem with deep voice because i feel like i am going to have trouble telling when someone is talking .

1	i have been a fan of barbra streisand for a long time . her music is so beautiful , and it will hold a special place in my heart .
0	i heard this album a couple time over the summer and have listened to it on repeat quite a number of time , but i have not yet reviewed it . i like it a lot , but it is not all that i would have hoped for . the album wa recorded live at a small club in new york . the musician are all top notch . the song are very interesting and the sound quality is excellent . there are a couple of track that are really good , but the overall sound quality is just not what i would have expected . some of the musician are not that good , and they are not very consistent . i like a lot of the music that is on this album , but i hope to hear better music from these musician in the future .

0	this song is a little bit catchy but the lyric are just terrible . they are so bad and it just make it so pointless .
0	i am sorry , but this cd is not worthy of jewel high caliber music . the quality of the music is poor , and jewel playing is not very good . she is got a nice voice , but she is not a great musician . she is not a very good musician . her playing is also not very well done . her playing is poor throughout the entire cd , and her singing is not a good a it could be . the lyric are good , but the music is not .

0	this song rock my world .
1	i really like this cd i have listened to it lot of time and the song love is really good .

1	this song ha a lot of energy , bruno mar sings it very well .
1	i love barbra streisand . i do not think i can listen to a barbra streisand album without thinking of this one . i do not know what it is , but it is certainly a musical gem . there is not much to do with it , it is simply there .
1	i love this album . she is just amazing and i can not believe she ha sung her whole life without recording something .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this song had a lot of potential and this is not a bad song .
0	i have listened to this a few time and i am really enjoying it . his production is very good ( like most of his music ) . i would classify this a a prince album , but not a his best . it ha a lot of great song . i really like the song come and raspberry beret . the other song on this album are not a good a come or raspberry beret .
0	i love all the song on this album . i love the message behind all of them .
0	in this cd , for the first time , the member of the dave clark five , in order , sing song that have been written specifically for the group . the song on this cd are : the first noel you do something to me you do something to me sister sister love , lust , faith , and fantasy do not let it go the first noel the first noel a time for love a time for love do not let it go a time for love you do something to me a time for love you do something to you a time for love do not let it fall a time for love you do something to your baby you do something to your baby the first noel you do something to your baby the first night a time for love a time for love a time for love

0	i do not know what to make of this collection of recording . i am impressed by the number of record i can get from it , but i am not overly impressed with the quality of the recording . the cd ha been recorded on the same date a a live performance at a venue called the bistro , in a city called bristow . i am almost positive that this wa done by the same group , and i am even more sure that the recording quality is very good , but i am not sure what to make of the set .

0	this album is fantastic ! this album is fantastic !
0	this is the best music i have ever heard . very good song and i love the music video too .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

1	the very best song ever - by you ! - not the very best singer of any song in any genre , and definitely not the best singer of any song in any genre i agree with you there , but you have to remember that the song ha been around for more than 20 year and most people like it . that being said , i could listen to it over and over again . i guess it is my own fault for not listening to the original , and listening to it in the context of it time , and not only in the context of it time , to understand it greatness .

1	i love this album . i love the original song . the band itself is very tight and the vocal are very good . i do not like the song that seem to be played over and over again . i am not sure what the problem is because i have always loved keith and he is always one of my favorite singer .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .

0	i give it a 3/10 . i am pleased with myself for buying it . if i wa expecting much higher quality , i would have just given it a 3/10 a well .
0	this is not worth buying . it sound like a demo tape or one of those bootleg cd that you find on your store cd shelf . the instrumentation is very strange , and the vocal are average . it is a decent song , but it wa not worth buying .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i have just started listening to the dave clark five and wa amazed at how good their music is . they are a band i would like to hear more of . i think they have a lot more to offer than just these three album . i do not think they need a full band , but they could certainly use a couple of drummer .
0	i would love to have this tape , but i am a bit afraid that it is a bit too raw for me . however , it ha a few good song on it .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i like it on the cdr . i like the original song with the guitar line . i want to buy

1	i love the song on this cd ! i have been listening to it for a while . they are all really good . they are all very well put together and the quality of the cd is really good . this is a good cd . it is really good .
0	the only reason i bought this wa because i love jazz , and i am a sucker for jazz record . however , this album had too much of the same stuff i have heard a million time . i love the opening i am back and the final i am alive . also , the song are played at the same speed . i am going to have to put this one down and listen to the one i already have .
0	i do not know why people hate tom waite . he is a great artist . his voice is really good . his song writing is quite good . his music is great . i do not know what it is about him . i do not like his voice . it is hard to listen to . when you listen to his music , you can hear the high and the low . when you hear his voice , it sound like a girl voice . his song are great . they are really great . i can not put him down . i really like all his song . and i really enjoy his music .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	this cd is good , but it play very , very slowly . i would give it a 2. it is not the worst cd i have ever listened to , but it is not the best . i would give it a 2 .
0	she doe a good job with her voice , but she is not a consistent a i would like .
0	this is jewel first album , and i am glad i listened to it because she is a very talented and unique singer . her vocal are quite different from her earlier stuff . this is a good cd , but i am not sure why i would buy it again . i do not like the music , and i do not like the lyric .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	this album is not a good a the first two album , but it is still a very good album . i am glad they are doing more of jazz music , but this album is better than the first two .
1	i am listening to this album . i am about to write a review on it . i have listened to the cd twice . the first song is god of all living and the second is prayer to god . i have heard that this album is very inspirational . i like this album and am glad that i got this album for my own personal collection . i like it and will listen to it again . i wa also looking for another christian album that wa more gospel oriented . this album wa definitely what i wa looking for . i am glad i got this album and i will be buying from this company again .

1	i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the mp3 from amazon - the process is easy . i am not a fan of this song . it is just a boring piece of garbage .

0	i had the pleasure of listening to the new 2 cd special release by the boston symphony orchestra on this day . the recording is excellent , but it is clear that someone took the time to play the note on the piano . how many cd can you listen to of the same piece of music ? i had to turn the volume down on this one .
1	i like this album . i think the music is good .

1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

1	i like the i love the way the lyric have the melody in the background part ! it make the song more interesting !
1	i think i would have gotten this song if i knew i would have bought it . i love it and would listen to it every day . it is one of the few song that make me think about the world and life in general .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i am a member of a choir and i love this cd . i love the music and the singing . it is very sweet . i also like the song that are not on the cd . the song that are on the cd are nice too .

1	this album just amazes me . every song on this album is amazing . the only thing i can compare it to is a very good movie . the song are the best so far . if you love this album , then you will love this album .
1	it is a prince album , but it doe not sound like prince style . i am not sure it is a prince album . it is a prince album because i do not know any other song from prince early album that are like this .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	she wa amazing on the cma award , and the new cd is just a amazing . the cd is very pleasant and the vocal are outstanding . this is my all time favorite album .
0	i love the song , but there are not many song i can relate to in that genre . i like it but i would not say i love this song .
0	i have listened to the song on several occasion . when i first listened to this song , i thought that it wa a great song for a school fundraiser .
0	i thought this album wa great . i like her voice and i think her song are good . i really like her song all that i need and i like if you love me .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this is an amazing album . not only is it a great album , it is a great album that will make you feel good . if you are in a bad mood , listen to it . if you are in a good mood listen to it . it will make you feel better .
1	i have been a jazz fan since i wa a little kid . tom scott is on of the best , and i am glad i found him .
1	this is a great album . but , i would suggest going to a different store on the internet to get this album . i do not want to know what the name of the album is . i do not want to know what the song is called . i just want to know what the album is . i just want to know what the album is . or , i
0	i love this song . it is so much better than the other song on this album .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this song wa ok
0	it is just another good song from the man .
1	this is my second favorite hammond album . this album is very good , but there are better song than this one , which is the song i am referring to .
0	i am not a fan of the beatles . i liked the original album and liked the concert , but i hated the song get back ( from the first album ) . this is by far the worst of all their album . the only good thing is that the vocal are good and the harmony are great . the rest is just annoying . i did like the intro of i want to hold your hand very much . the next track , i have just seen a face , is also good . love me do is by far the best track . the only good thing about this album is that the music is extremely varied and it ha a good amount of good song .
0	i like my iphone but i need more battery life .
0	i do not like this song , the song is too long for me . i like when a song is short and simple . this song is so long that you have to put it on repeat to hear the song . i am sorry , but i do not like this song .
0	this is one of the most underrated trance album . the song are very average , and i do not understand why they bothered releasing this album . they could have put out a new album within a week and released it a a single .
0	my son really enjoyed this song , but he did not like the chorus .
0	this is an excellent recording . the only problem is that it is on the beethoven symphony . why is it on the beethoven symphony ? because it is , and because they are so excellent , i had to get it .
1	i love the song , i hope she sings it in concert .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this is in the top 30 song . i do not normally buy these kind of song but this song ha a really nice melody to it .
1	this is just the best cd i have heard . i have been a fan of reo since they started , and this is the best one yet ! they have a great sound for a country band .

0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	the music ha good beat and is not too loud . it is not a good a some of the other e.s . posthumus cd i have heard .
1	i love it ! this is one of my favorite of her hit .
0	i have to say , when i first put this cd in to my player , i wa expecting something akin to the white album , but in a much more traditional manner . i guess i wa a bit disappointed by the lack of innovation . but after listening to this album , i have come to realize that i wa wrong . i actually like the beatles a lot , but i think this is their best album . their other album are just not a good a this one .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	the band performed farewell in the first two episode of the soprano , and it wa performed in the wedding for the soprano 40th anniversary .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i have been waiting for this song for a very long time . this is one of the best cover i have ever heard . i loved the song and the artist .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	really nice clean version .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	for the people who do not like the dave clark five , this is a pretty good version of the love of god though the lyric are really really hard to understand .
0	i really like this album , but really have to say that i like the instrumentals more . i would like to have more instrumentals on this album .
1	classic album . great music , excellent vocal , great instrument . very good album . is a little pricey , but worth the money . is a very good album that i would recommend to anyone who like classical music .
1	i am a huge lorde fan and this song is perfect for me . my favorite part is that when she sings the wake up it is like it is singing to me .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i do not know if he is really trying to be funny or really stupid , but it is really hard to listen to . i like it when he is funny , and i wish he would
1	i really like this song . i would recommend this song to everyone . this song is great with a great chorus .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i do not know where i got this song , but i like it .
0	it is a good album , but not extraordinary . it is definitely a nice album . i will give it one star , but it is not a best album of the year award .
0	not bad , only complaint being that the song love you baby is very long , i am not sure if it is the song or the recording , but it take forever to play .
0	a very good album . i like the rocking sound . i do not like the album cover . it is too old school for me . i will not purchase this product .

0	i bought a cd to listen to in my car . it is very good !
0	this album ha great song , but the beat are horrible . great song , but the beat are horrible . this album ha me hooked to prince , but if i can not get the music out of my head it really doe not do anything . a waste of money .
0	i bought the album ( a year or so ago ) and i still listen to it constantly . it would make a great christmas song or wedding song . my husband play it in the car when we are driving , or he listens to it when he is fixing the car . i love the voice on this song .
0	i give this album a 4 star rating because of the song . i think that it could have been a little better . i think it ha some good song that i like but most of them are just ok .
1	i love this album . all of the song were great . i am glad i got it on cd rather than a cassette tape .
0	i do not really like her music . i like most of the band music . some of her song are nice , but the majority of them are just not good . i guess i do not like her because she sings the same way a lot of folk do . her vocal are just not good . i do not think she can sing too well .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	i do not know if he is trying to be funny but it is really hard to listen to . i love it when he doe it is funny , and i wish he would do it more .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i wouldve liked to hear it from the girl from the rocky horror picture show singing it for barbra streisand . the song is good .
0	i think this is one of wait better album . i like the song . i like the musicianship . it is not a great album , but it is a good one .

1	i love this band . i love the song , i love the way it is played and i love the music . i love the fact that they were able to write and record so many song in such a short time . this album is a great album . they could have recorded it in a month and it would have been an awesome album . it is a great album , and i hope it sell well . we live in a great country and this album is a great way to show the world they can have a band like this .
0	i like bruno mar , but this album is not worth buying .
1	i use the iphone everyday
1	this is the one i love best . i love how she sings on stage .
1	i had never heard of this artist before and i wa glad to see this wa a cd with many song that i had never heard of . i wa pleased to see that there were song that i had heard on the radio , but had never heard on a cd before . this cd is very good . i recommend it .
0	i love this song . it is very catchy .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i love this song , and i hope this song is a big hit for the song . this is a great song . listen to it !
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i have played this on many different occasion , but i am not sure if i have ever heard it on the radio . i think that this is a lovely song and one i would like to have on the radio .

1	this is a wonderful collection of classical music from the great composer of the 19th and 20th century . the sound quality on the cd is excellent . the song are well performed .
0	i wa looking for a rock album this weekend and stumbled upon this . the album cover look like a music magazine cover , with a guitar strapped to it , and a large , black plastic globe of a planet in the background . the music is very good , and the sound is not just a little better than some of the other record i have heard , but it is better than a lot of the other record i have heard . the only real downside is that the cd ha a lot of scratchy , digital distortion , and the album is very , very thin . i would have preferred the same amount of detail in the sound , and more of a real recording .
0	there is a reason why i have a hard time getting a good album of the 60 and 70 on my car stereo . the only way i can get it is if i get the stereo set to high . the only reason i could get a 90 album is if i get the stereo set to high . but in doing that i can not get the other album .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )

1	when i heard this album , i almost threw it across the room . this album is simply amazing . i am a huge bonnie raitt fan and i wa just blown away by how good this album wa . i will definitely buy more . this album is one that i will have on my list for a long time .
0	i am a bit of a classic rock fan , and i love old record . the one thing in my music collection that i wa missing , though , wa my collection of beatles record . after looking around for day , i located several used copy of the old album , and went ahead and ordered them . but i came to the sad conclusion that all of them had been cleaned and recut , and that all of them were missing the very rare , out-of-print version of the album . when i asked about it , i wa told that they had never been heard from , and that the only copy of the album in existence were the one from the 1950s that were being re-released on cd , in the hope that some people would get an opportunity to listen to them again . i am sad to say that i am not one of those people . but what i am sad about is that i have spent so much time and money on these album , and yet they have completely slipped my mind . that is a shame - i really wish i could have heard them .
0	this is my favorite song . i love every song on this album . it one of my favorite .
0	one of the best record i have ever heard . this is a great album of all different type of music . the song blend together well a a whole .
1	this is one of the best christmas cd i have heard in a long time . the vocal performance of marie osmond is excellent . the arrangement are beautiful . the song are very well arranged and performed .
0	i listen to this album all the time . i am a fan of the dave clark five and enjoy their music . i like the song and the music . i would like for this to be released on a cd that is not this offensive . robert
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is the best album of your life
0	i love this song . i love miley .
0	not very good at all . the production is great , but it is just not the same .
1	i would rather listen to the original version , but it doe have a good beat , and i guess it is kind of catchy .
0	in this collection of track , this album ha several gem . worth is my favorite . i do not mean it is the best song on the album but it is the best song i have ever heard . i am so glad i got this album . i would recommend this if you like jeff buckley or john mayer .
1	i am a big fan of positive song . i am a little confused about the chord on this one . i am assuming it in the verse , but the chord do not make sense to me .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	i have to disagree with those who have not listened to this cd yet . the music is very relaxing and it is beautiful .
1	a very good cover of the longest yard
0	this is an absolutely terrible song ! this is definitely not a good song at all . it is so bad , and you can not wait to get out of the house when you hear it . it is actually really bad for you . i am seriously trying to find a way to get rid of this song , and i hope i can because it is horrible .
0	it is not a bad album , but it is not my favorite either . i have to admit that the song are well written and well played , but i do not like the sound of the album .
0	while i can not say i always agree with the opinion of rk , this album is indeed a great album . many of the song are great . i personally love love me like a man and hoodlum .
1	i got this from amazon today . i am a fan of hers . i am a fan of other artist , so i get a lot of jewel cd from amazon . but this wa the only one i could get today . a of 5:30 pm cst , it wa still on sale . i have a feeling this one will be my favorite . i am not a big jewel fan , but i love the music of her . i am a fan of all music . i listen to country , bluegrass , folk , blue and white rock and jazz . i also love pop music , but my favorite now is the christian music i listen to on my sony cd player , the one that i have with the built-in turntable .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this album is a great jewel album .
1	this song really ha a message , and it is a very powerful message . i feel like i am going

0	like a lot of rock song , i do not really notice anything about it . i like it , but . i have no idea what to make of it .
0	great , but not a good a i remembered . it is not that it is bad , it is just that i had a hard time recognizing the music - the vocal were a little out of place . i like the guitar work , but i am not sure how much of it i can actually remember . it is a good guitar album , but i am not sure i can say the same for the vocal .
1	this is the first cd by ponder that i have ever heard . i do not really know what to say . i have enjoyed listening to it , but i do not know how to rate it . i would go with an 8 if i were rating it .

1	this album is really good . i think that it ha a good quality and i think that it is just good . i think that this is the best trance album so far .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this album is a must have for every fan of oldie . the album start off with the a christmas fanfare which is followed by i will be home for christmas which is followed by god rest ye merry gentleman . the album then go into another medley of here come santa claus and jingle bell . the album end with auld lang syne .

1	i heard this album and i liked it . i really like the song . there are two of them on the album , and they are so good . i have been a fan of jewel since i first heard her on the black album and the love song . i have loved this album , and i hope it will be good for her . the song are great , and i look forward to another album from her .
0	if you can get past the song being all over the place and the overdubs on the guitar and vocal , this is a good album .
0	i really like this album , the only reason i did not give it five star is because i like all his other album more and i do not like this one so much . i am definitely going to buy the album for my sister birthday . i am going to listen to it with her . i am just not really into this music .

1	the music of dave clark five is a great mix of pop and traditional folk . i found it to be a very enjoyable experience . i would highly recommend this cd .
1	it is a great album to listen to if you are looking for a r kelly tribute album . you will find everything from his early work to his latest song . if you would like to hear r kennedy original song , then you can not get much better than this .
1	i love my dave clark five !
0	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i am not a fan of this song . it just a boring piece of garbage .
0	i think that this album is a good album . the song are very good , the guitar is nice , the vocal are good , the production is good , and the album overall is worth the money .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this album is great . my favorite album this year .

0	the song are great and the voice is beautiful .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i first heard this band when i saw them live in my hometown . they were great . i have heard about them from friend , but i had never heard them . i wa very excited when they released the first album . i am glad i waited and bought their second album . it is a very good album . i really like the album . i would recommend it to people that are interested in the style of music they play .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	i like dave clark five . they are one of my favorite band .

1	it sound great . i am looking for a song to listen to while doing my hair . i listen to the cd player while i am doing my hair . but i have to turn up the volume because it is hard to hear the cd at the volume that i have to listen to it at . i have a laptop with speaker and when i put the cd in the laptop speaker work great . but i have to turn the speaker up a little because they do not have a volume control . but the cd player will not play the cd at the volume that i want it to . i have a sony cd player . i will have to turn it up a little because the volume of the cd is too low . i believe my cd player wa made in the late 1990s . it wa a sony cd player . the cd player will only play up to cd-rw . so that is a problem . i would like to find a song to play at the volume at which the sound is comfortable .

1	i really like this song .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this is a very good song . you can listen to it from a car radio .

0	she ha a good voice , but i wish she did not have to sing all the song . i also wish she would sing more song from her album one more day from the same album .
1	i am a fan of the karajan/schubert/brahms triptych . it is a perfect mixture of the three , and the three are perfect together in a kind of tri-unity that i think is rare in music . i love the music of this , and i love the song-writing , but i just do not like the way it is always got to be one of those perfect , perfect combination that are not in any way satisfying to me . i mean , the way schubert voice change depending on the song . i do not know . i like schubert music , but i do not like the way it is always got to be one of those three perfect , tri-perfect combination that are not in any way satisfying to me . it is like a perfect triptych , but i am just not quite sure about it . i mean , the way schubert voice change depending upon the song . like if the song is called greensleeves and the theme is i love you , and the theme is i love you , and the song wa called i love you and the theme wa greensleeves , what would you expect the theme to be ? i do not know . so i do not like the way it is always got to be one of these three perfectly perfect combination that are not in any way satisfying to me . i just do not like the way it is always got to be one , one , one , one and the other two are always a little bit off . it is not satisfying to me , and i am not sure why it is always got to be one , one , one , one , and the other two are always a little off . it is not satisfying to me . the music is good , and i have to admit that the music of this , like everything else in music , is a kind of miracle . but it is not satisfying to me . the lyric are good . it is not satisfying to me . the recording is good . it is not satisfying to me . the production is good , but it is not satisfying to me . it is not satisfying to me . the arrangement is good . it is not satisfying to me . the band is good . it is not satisfying to me . karajans voice is good . it is not satisfying to me . the music is good . it is not satisfying to me . the lyric are good . it is satisfying to me .
1	i agree with you , i love your review of this album . i agree with you , i love this album . it is my favorite r. kelly album .
0	this is the best song on the album !
0	this song is one of the absolute worst song ever . the lyric are terrible , the music is terrible , the sound is terrible , the guitar solo is terrible . the dave clark five are great , in my opinion , but this song is below average .
1	this is yet another great cd from dave clark five ! the song are really well-crafted and this is one of the best collection of song i have ever heard . i just really like the way the song are arranged , especially compared to the old master . i like the way the song are mixed together , and i love the band vocal and their harmony . this is a great cd !
1	i like alot of her song .
1	i like to hear it again and again .
0	i am sorry , but if you do not like this song , then you are not a true fan of trance .
0	i like it because it is tom waite . it is not his best song . i would listen to it again .
1	this is an excellent cd . it is a great way to spend a few dollar . it is very enjoyable . the cd is very nice .
1	i am a first time listener , but i fell in love with this record . i love the lyric , and the sound of it . i hope this album keep coming . i bought it when it first came out . it is worth every penny .

1	i love this beautiful song . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and free my stress from a busy day this will be my first choice .
1	i have really enjoyed listening to ohearn on a lot of different track . his music is quite pleasant to listen to and i would recommend that the listener ha a good ear to hear what he is doing .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i don ’ t like this album . it ’ s a shame because i love david lee roth . i ’ m glad that he had the chance to record a new album and i hope that he can get back to the music he had before . i am glad that he is recording again . i ’ m glad that i have had the chance to see him live . i ’ m glad i have the chance to see him play live . i ’ m glad i have the chance to hear his music .
1	i have got a couple of these album and have not heard a bad song from either of them . this album is very good . the song are all well performed and i have enjoyed each album . i am having a hard time finding the song on the cd .

1	very nice and fun .
0	this is an album of various song by ohearn . i enjoyed listening to it .
1	love , love , love this album . love it !
1	i bought this cd in the hope that there would be some tom wait in the cd . i wa not disappointed.i bought this cd to listen to at a friend house . what i like about tom wait is that he is very versatile . i listen to him a few time a year and when i see him live , i will attend . i love the song that he ha written-they are all beautiful and moving , even the one that are not in this cd . they are all very personal to him-he seems to have written only for himself . i would like to hear more of his song in the future . a cd with song from his other album would be a great gift for a tom wait fan . i found that i liked the cd-it is very well produced.i am not a tom wait fan per se-i am a musician , not a tom wait fan . however i do like his music and enjoy listening to it . what i like about this cd , is the sound quality-it sound great . there is no distortion or noise which is very good . i highly recommend this cd-i have been listening to it everyday for about a month now , and love it and i will continue to listen to it . i like the fact that tom wait ha written quite a few song for himself , and ha been doing it for a long time , and is still able to write . this cd ha a great and personal sound without being watered down or made into some sort of gimmick . i have listened for about a month and am very happy with this cd-it is one of the best i have heard in a long time . i would consider it a must have in any tom wait fan cd collection .
1	this is a demo recording of a singer on the radio singing the song of the ponder sister . this recording is awful and i will not listen to it . i have never heard anything so unlistenable . i will not listen to it . i would not recommend this cd .
0	tom wait is at his best here , very well played , with an excellent mix of blue and country . the vocal is excellent , and the production is top notch . i can not believe that you have gone to the trouble to make a cd of tom wait , and you can not find a single good track .
0	lariein is a really bad song .
1	i really love this album ! it is so great !
0	i have a hard time listening to music that is not in my genre . i have heard other artist song that were not in my genre and it doe not bother me .
1	this song is amazing ! i have been listening to this song for the past two year . i love it . i have been listening to it on repeat since i first heard it . i love it ! i love miley because she is so nice and she ha a positive attitude . i love the video . it wa hilarious ! i love the music and it make me feel happy ! i love it !
1	i really enjoy all the song on this album . i really hope that they do another album . this is a real jazz album . the bass player is fantastic . they really have a great show that is very entertaining .
1	this is a great album . the song are fun and the music is really nice . i am not familiar with hammond and this album doe not really do him justice , but i am still glad i bought it .
0	i am going to be a very negative review . this is truly an album that should be listened to only when you need a break from your daily work . if you are sick of your music and you want to listen to music that will blow you away , this is the album for you . if you like alternative or indie music , this is an album you should not miss . i am going to try my best to explain why this one is a bad one . i will be very specific so you can truly appreciate the music . in this album , i do not like drown because the bass drum is too soft and the rest of the drum are all soft . blackbird is one of my favorite because the guitar is very nice and the riff are very catchy . noel is just an average song because the lyric are very generic and it doe not flow the way you want it to flow and the chorus doe not really flow . the next song , sister christian is a very interesting song because the song ha this very catchy riff that i have never heard before . it ha a noise or noisey sound to it that is nice . garden of earthly delight is an average song because the lyric are very generic and it doe not flow a you want it to flow . then when you listen to the album again , you will realize that it just sound like a lot of other song by this band . the end of the album is average in many way . the music is average in many way and the lyric are very generic and do not flow the way you want them to flow . i am sorry but i will rate this at 2 star . i feel like this album is a waste of time because the song are generic and they do not flow the way you want them to flow .
1	this is a great song . the lyric are very clever and catchy . i am enjoying the whole album . but i think if you do not like him personally you will not enjoy his music .
0	i am not sure what to say . i wa impressed with his first album , but this one is terrible . it is a one-trick pony kind of album . just listen to all of it and you will see what i am talking about . you can not really take a bad album at face value . i wish i had paid more attention to the title of the album . it is called skyworld , but it is not really about that . it is about the music . i would recommend this album to those who are looking for a good album , but not willing to pay $ 15 .
1	i wa expecting more from this cd , yet i am disappointed . i loved the first cd . i am happy she ha released the second cd . sam sparro is a very talented singer .
1	i really appreciate this cd . the song on the cd are excellent . it is a very nice cd .
1	i love some good year and i am so lonesome i can cry both song are song i have heard many time but have not remembered the word to . i just downloaded the song and it is fantastic ! it is a great song that i will add to my collection .
0	not bad , but she need to lose the singing voice . if you want to hear her sing , then buy her cd . i am not a jewel fan , but she is a great singer and a great song writer . it is not her fault that she ha to work so many hour to make a living , but she is not a bad person and she is not a bad singer . she just ha some serious problem . maybe she will go back to being a normal human being , and she will just have to learn to live with the fact that she is a pop star .
0	i bought this on impulse and i have to say it is a great album . i really enjoyed the album and liked the first song . lyric are good and the music is great . i recommend it to anyone .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i hate this song .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	this is so simple and beautiful , and i have been listening to it many year . it is a great song to listen to on the way to work , and it always make me feel better .
1	this song is a great start to the cd . it is a little bit different than most jazz song . i really enjoy listening to this song . i think it is a great start to the cd . i wish they could have included a little bit more of this song in the cd . i would have liked to have seen a little bit more of it , but i am sure the cd is still worth a purchase .
0	it is an awful song . it is not bad , but it is not the best .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i love this album . i like how steve is able to make the music sound like he is on his own , rather than just going along with the group . i like how the song are a little more than song . this is a great album . i am a fan of this band .
0	i found this quite enjoyable . not a lot of variety but not boring either . i would give it an 8 instead of a 7 .
1	this is a fun song . i think that i like it more than the album .

1	i have always loved this song , but did not have the song on any device . i love to play this at christmas time .
1	this is a good collection of song . the production is quite good and r & b at it best . this is a good introduction to r & b .
0	i have been looking for a song with a similar message to this . so far , i have found only one which doe not have the same message . a lot of people have probably heard this song , but they have not heard this one . however , if they have , they are probably not aware that the two song are the same . it is a good looking song , but it is not a very good song . i do not believe that a song with a similar message wa ever made , but this one doe have a very good message and it is one of the few song , other than one other song , that i like . this song is another song that i like . it is very easy to read and the message is there , but it is not clear . i do not like the message this song ha and i do not think it is a good song or a good message . i like the message , but i do not like the song . it is one of the best song i have heard yet and i have heard so many song that are pretty good that this one is among the worst . i do not like this song and it is one of the worse song i have heard yet . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . i do not like this song , but it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to all year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to all of this year . it is something i have to listen to , but i think i will never listen to it again . this song is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year . it is one of the worst cd i have listened to so far this year .
0	this cd is a great album for the fall . i purchased this for my 8 year old son and he enjoyed it very much . this is a great album for the early fall . this is a great album for the fall . - you are the best thing i have ever done - thank you for the life you gaved me - you are the best thing i have ever done
1	i have now listened to about half of the song on this collection . i have to say , that these song are all very enjoyable and have some excellent music . marie is not a great singer , but her voice is very beautiful . she sings with a wonderful , clear , and clear voice . i believe the best singer are those who can sing in several different way . marie can sing easy and then she can switch to her harder side and i find this admirable .
1	i have been listening to his music since i wa a kid . i wa very impressed when i heard him play the piano . i bought his first album . i wa very impressed when i heard him play the piano . i loved his music . i still love his music . i think he is the best of the best and if i wa

1	i listen to the dave clark five all the time . i really like their music .
0	i am a huge chris young fan , so i wa excited to have a copy of his new cd , love can not wait . i have to say that i do not think his cd is a must have , but i think it is a good cd . the only song i did not like were the one that have that he is just a singer feel to them , but there are some good song on the cd . some of them are very good . the only thing i do not like about the album is that it ha a very annoying song on it called i will be your woman that is a good song , but it sound like a remix of the bee gee song money ( that is what i want ) it is just annoying . i am not going to try to change the song , if it is there i will listen to it , but i have to say that i do not think it is very good . the album is good , but i think it is better a a single . i have to say i have heard only 2 song from the cd that i like , and i think the other song are all good , but i do not remember the name of the song i liked on the cd . it also ha a very short story on it called i have no word , which is very short . it is very short and i think it is a very good story , but i have to say that the song i liked on the cd , take me away is better , the song is good but the story is terrible
0	i like this cd , i think it is a good collection of song , but i am not sure if it is one that i would buy . it is worth something , but it is not something i would buy in one sitting , or even buy in a couple of evening . it is a nice cd , but i do not think it is a great one .
0	i had listened to this song in the car on the way home from work . i wa singing along with my daughter . i had a very good feeling and felt a if this wa a song that i could write about because it wa so important to me . i think that people will think that it a song that people sing in the car . i do not think so because a a writer i would write about it more than just singing it one time .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	i love it . the music is so beautiful . it make me cry . this is a great song .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .

0	the quality of the download is quite poor . i would not recommend this site to people who want to download music .

1	this is pleasant and soothing . i like this piece of music .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i like this band . i love the beatles . thank you for the memory of me .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i do not think this is a song about a woman love life . it is a song about a woman love life .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this album made me want to use this website le

0	this collection of recording wa provided by the record label omni . it wa recorded over a period of several year and wa made into a cd-r version about a year ago . when i received the cd-r i immediately took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top and then took it back to the original lp packaging and put the cd on top . my intent wa to record the song on the cd-r with my own vocal and then put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve . i did that and then i put the cd on top of the lp in the original cd sleeve .
0	i have listened to this cd more than i should . to me , this is a boring cd that doe not move me either musically or lyrically . my only comment is that i like her voice and her lyric . the music is just ok. i enjoy her song and i think she ha a very unique and beautiful voice . i enjoy her music and i think she ha a very unique and beautiful voice . but , i can not stand her lyric . it is just a if they were made to rhyme . i have listened to music other artist have made that are also bad . but , not this one . i like this artist . i think she is great . i would like to meet her . i would like to see her live . but , i do not think she would like me .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

1	karajan is perhaps the most underrated singer-songwriter in the history of music ; there are countless album of his song that have yet to be heard on any kind of commercial scale . he ha a gift for expressing emotion in his music that few other artist can match . his song have a universal quality . the song that stand out from the others are love is in the air , love is in the air , the sound of music and the first time ever i saw your face . for him , the music wa just another form of art , and he wa just another person who wa simply a musician . despite his seemingly humble background , the man had an insatiable hunger for creativity and musical expression . his song have been performed by many famous artist over the year , including : james taylor , billy joel , the beach boy , the eagle , david bowie , sting , david bowie , leonard cohen , paul simon , john denver , david cassidy , billy joel , and many others . karajans music ha been covered by many other artist , including : don henley , the eagle , the beach boy , george michael , john denver , and many others . he ha been inducted into the songwriter hall of fame and is also one of the few musician to have been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame .
1	this album ha a great song writing , and the song production is great .
0	i did not know this piece very well , but i am now completely in love .
1	tom scott make great music .

0	this cd is bad . it is very bad sound quality .
0	this is not a bad song , but it doe not have a good beat .
0	we know miley cyrus is a pop singer . but , this song is one of the best that she ha ever written .
1	wow , it is been a few year since i have heard her , but this is an amazing album ! i love that she ha the courage to put her opinion out there , i think she is a very intelligent and beautiful woman . not only is she intelligent , but she is also beautiful and ha a lot of charisma . i hope people listen to her music .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i have had this tape for some time and have been waiting for the perfect opportunity to review it . this is not the tape to do that . i will try it again and will let you know how i feel .
0	wow , this is a little odd . i ordered this cd yesterday , and it wa shipped today . all look good , just a couple of track and the artwork . i can not really tell what it is . there is no track list or anything - i am guessing that it is some sort of electronic demo . i am not even sure if it is a cd or a dvd .
1	i am glad i bought this album . i love e.s.posthumus . i play him all the time .
0	this is terrible .
0	this song ha a great chorus , but the lyric suck .
1	this song is a little boring but the vocal are great .
1	i have a lot of fond memory of listening to my dad playing the you have got a friend and for you album . for some odd reason , i have always assumed these were for my dad ( and i am pretty sure my dad did not know that i actually bought them ) . i wa very sad to hear that he bought these album for me , but i guess it is okay , because they are all still here . and i will never forget the day he brought home a new album , you have got a friend by paul mccartney , and i wa so excited for it . i could hear that it wa the new album and i thought it wa so much better than the old one . i also remember the time i finally got my first cd player and i wa thrilled to find out my dad had bought this album for me . i had heard the song on the radio , but had never seen them in print , so when i saw that it wa a brand new , brand new album , i told him the album had to be mine , and he said he knew right then and there that i would be the first to have this new album . my dad wa always very interested in music and in music history , so i suppose he just thought it wa a gift . he listened to some song on the album and then , after some conversation , he brought the album into the living room and played it for me . i wa very excited to hear the song and i loved them . when i listened to the album again , though , i started to hear the song in my head ( that is how they start , you know ) , so i just stopped playing the album . i did not like the album , and i did not like the song that i heard in my head . i had a lot of anger and hurt inside me and i felt like i had lost my father . i did not know why , but i felt like i would lost my dad somehow , and i hated that album and everything it symbolized . and then , that night , i wa listening to the album again and it wa the first time i had really listened to the album in quite a while . i wa still upset but i wa listening to the song in my head and i could not understand something that i wa hearing , and it made me so sad . i ended up playing the album for the first time in a really long time , and i could hear the song in my head , and i wa really annoyed . i wa very upset with the album and i hated it . i wa really upset with myself for not listening to it in a long time , and i felt like i had let my dad down , not listened to the album in a long time and not played it for my dad . so i ended up playing it for the second time in a really long time , and i wa really annoyed . i felt really bad and i hated the album . but it wa the only album i had ever played for my dad and i wa really mad at myself for not listening to it in a long time and playing it for my dad , and yet , i wa really mad at the album and i hated it . i really hated the album and my dad for buying it for me , and i felt really good about myself for buying it . i decided that i would really like to listen to the album again , so i went into the bedroom and listened to the album . i wa really annoyed by the album and i hated it .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	amazing ! this is a very beautiful worship song !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i bought the book love story from amazon . it arrived today . i like the cover art . the book is very good . i will be
1	i found this cd to be very nice and relaxing .
0	this song is amazing . i do not know why there is a whole website devoted to this song , i really like it , it just sound like a bad brandy song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	the first thing i noticed is that i do not know anyone who sings this song . then i noticed that this song is very popular and is a christmas classic .
0	i like sam singing voice , but i do not like what he is doing . he seems to be trying to put on a tough act , but it just doe not work .
0	
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love this song . when i wa 9 , i used to dance around my room to the music . my family always commented on my cute little dance . i never did it again .
1	i wa hoping to hear you are the voice by the eagle , but this is one of the best song they have ever recorded . if you love rock and roll , you will enjoy this cd very much .
1	i bought this to start with and discovered that it is actually an old radio show that is made up of the song of the star of the movie . it is great . i can not wait for the next series .
1	it reminds me of the way i have always loved to sing . i love the way the music and the lyric flow together .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i went to this website to look for some recommendation and review on some of the cd i am about to purchase . i found all the cd to be of good quality . this is the 6th cd i have purchased from this website . overall , i think i am more than pleased with the cd i have purchased from this website .
1	this is a really good , beautiful song . it is a great song for a little child that is trying to learn to read . the verse is a little hard to understand , but the melody is very catchy and fun to listen to . the song end a little fast , but the song is so sweet and beautiful that you can not help but smile .
0	this is just a bad cd . what is the purpose in this ? it doe not make sense . i do not like her music , but i do not like this cd . there wa nothing on the cd that i wanted to listen to . the song are not good . why wa this a part of a cd series that wa supposed to promote her book ? it seems that she could have done much better .
1	this album is a big step forward for the band . i really like the song , especially the one i have heard before . i hope this album will be the first one to be re-released in a few year , i really want to hear all the rest of the album from this cd .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .

1	this is very good . i really like the lyric and it ha a very nice beat . i enjoy wanya morris , and i love this song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i like this song . i will let you know .
0	definitely a great song , but this is not really my type of music . the lyric are a little strange .
1	i love to use my cell phone
1	i have to admit , i like the line in this song , when you are in a bad mood , i am going to come and sit by you and talk about it .

1	i like this album . i have heard it before but i just had to try it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and over and over and over again . each new song is different . i can never get tired of it .
1	i am listening to this song on my car radio and i am having a ball !
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	thanks for all the information . i had no idea who they were .

1	prince is one of the most talented and influential musician of his generation .
0	this is very disappointing , if this is an april fool day joke . i guess you could say it is the story of a christmas carol . it is a very good song , but not outstanding . it is not good enough to be a christmas carol . the only redeeming quality is that the lyric are funny . the music is average . i am not sure why this is a joke . i am not sure why the song is titled the story of a christmas carol . i guess it is supposed to be a parody of the song .
1	i love the video . it is so cute !
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i got this song to listen to on my ipod , and i wa wondering why it wasnt on my mp3 player , and it wa just a waste of my time . i can not wait to delete it from my ipod .
1	i actually do not know who this song is by , but i know it is a good song . i first heard it at a friend house and fell in love with it . i bought it about a year ago . it is very good . i have also bought it on itunes .
1	i enjoy this one because i have been listening to it for a couple of hour and it ha already made me a believer .
0	this is very boring . i do not like it . the best song from the first two or three are the one on the first two or three . the rest is all stupid and boring . the band is not very good . i do not think i will even listen to this again .
0	we are all going to die and i would like to hear something i can listen to that doe not make me want to kick somebody in the face . i believe love is the greatest gift of all . it is not a curse . i think if we had the real mccoy and we really loved each other , it would make a huge difference in our life . but i guess that is a pipe dream .
0	this is an interesting tune . the lyric are good , but the melody is somewhat corny .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i bought a cd by the name of jesus is all i need by joni mitchell and i liked it very much .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	bonnie tyler ha a voice and a unique voice which is hard to find . this is the first time i have heard her sing and i love her voice .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	all the song are great . i love the way the song are divided up . however , i think that love song is a little bit weak . i think it could be a good song , though . i think any song off of this album ha to be good . and the lyric are great .

0	i do not really know what to say about this album other than it is okay . i like some thing in it , but you have to listen to the whole album to get the full effect .
0	i bought this a a gift for someone and had it for 3 day when i received the package and put it in the box . the track were pretty good , but the audio quality wa terrible . i am not a fan of these type of release and this one wa no exception and the price wa just ridiculous . i have not listened to it for 3 day so i will be reviewing it on it own when i listen to it .
1	this is a good album . the artist is excellent and the quality of the music is great .
1	i agree with you , i love this album . you need to hear him live . i went to his concert and saw him perform dream and i wa in love . the song dream is probably my favorite song on the album . the lyric flow very well and the music is very nice . it just remind me of the old day when i used to listen to r. kelly . i think this album is very good .
0	good album , but it is a little too long for my taste . the song are also not very good .
1	this song ha a good message . it is a good song , and i like it . i think the video is nice , but i am not sure if it is appropriate for an advertising campaign .
1	i have been listening to this song for year . i love it . i bought it for my husband . he is a huge fan of the song . he wa thrilled with the song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i really enjoyed this song , but i am not sure what i would change . i did like the song , though . i liked that it is a song about a lady who get a letter from someone or someone somewhere . the lyric are pretty good , too . i do not know what i would change , but i liked the song .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i wa in the mood for something a little more upbeat . this is a decent album , but it is a bit too much of a gimmick for my taste .
0	i have been a fan of jewel for many year and have bought all of her album . this is my favorite of her album . i really enjoy listening to this cd . the song are nice and the sound quality is good .
0	i am not impressed with this cd . all of the song are terrible and i could not understand what is the point of spending money on this cd . this is a shame that there is a cd that cost $ 20 that ha all of the song by billy preston .
0	this is a horrible cd . i can not believe how bad it is . the song are good , but the song are all terrible . i do enjoy the song but there are a lot of bad song in this cd . the quality of the sound is poor . i do not think she would of done better on a studio recording . this is a horrible cd .
0	this is the best cd i have ever bought . you can tell from the title that this is a jazz album . and it is . the tune are all completely original , catchy , and fun . the song are fun and the vocal are okay . there is a lot to like about this cd . the beat are great and so are the guitar solo . the cd play a a cd doe and it play perfectly in my car .

1	the best pop song ever . the best pop song ever .
1	i am a huge fan of the music of tom wait , this is his first cd , i have heard , so far anyway , i am sure it will not be his last .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	the band is a great band . i love the song ! this is a great song to rock out to .

0	a very good album for those who liked their music in the 70 . a for the rest of u , we need to move on .
1	i like the song . i like that miley sings about her dream , but i do not think she is doing drug .
0	i really like his music , but his voice is not what i would consider to be a powerful singer . he is very nice and cool , but he is not very good at singing . he usually sings like a teeny bopper , and not a powerful singer . he is usually singing in falsetto , so he sound like a teeny bopper . he is nice , and i think he is a nice guy , but he is not very good at singing . i do not understand why he is still on the show .
1	i have been listening to this album in my car for month and month on end . it ha been a favorite for so long that i have been able to sing along with it without even realizing i wa singing . great album .
1	this song is great . i wa in the car and the radio came on . it wa so beautiful i wa so happy . now i can find the rest of this cd !

0	this is a very poor album and i wa very disappointed in the quality . this cd is the first cd i have ever had that wa not recorded on cd and i will pas it by without buying it .
1	i purchased this album on amazon thinking it wa country music and it is actually a dance pop album . i wa expecting a country/western record but it is really a dance music record . i love the song on this album , but i do not know what genre it belongs in . i think it is a little bit of everything .
0	he started playing again after the death of his wife in 1979 , and he continued to give concert and recording . the first of these wa in toronto , canada , in november 1979 .
0	i bought this album because of the great review . i thought i would give it a try . i thought it sounded great . not really all that interesting , but i thought it wa well done .
0	this song doe not give me the feeling i got from hearing it the first time .
0	the song are very nice , but the album is very repetitive , boring and uninteresting .
0	i love this album . i buy a lot of album and this album is one of the best in my opinion . i have listened to it over and over again and it is still fresh and sound amazing .
1	this wa a fun album to listen to . i have been a fan of reo since they came out . i own most of their album but this one is the only one i have that i am able to play at loud volume . i do hope that they continue to record and release better album .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is the worst song on the album .
1	this album wa one of my first purchase . i found it by accident . i wa flipping through the back page and came across the cd . i had previously purchased the dark side of the moon and i wa just amazed at all the different style and style of music that they did . i loved the song on this album , and for this reason i picked up the dark side of the moon . i would love to have this album in my collection .
1	i love allan bole . i have grown to like his music , which is really no surprise . but i have grown to like him personally , which is a different story . i am kind of a big fan of the early 90 , but i found it is hard to find stuff that is not rock for me . i have listened to a lot of christian music , but i have never heard any christian music that i loved . i thought that i wa the only one . now i know that i am not .
1	i am not much of a fan of this artist , but i do appreciate the talent of the musician . i give it 4 star .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	lareine . i love this album . she ha the best music .
1	i am a huge fan of ohearn . i have been a fan since i started buying his cd . i had never heard of him when i got this cd . i am now a fan of his work , and this cd is a must have .
1	this is a great cd that ha some of the best song ever . my favorite is the song of love . ( i love the song of the love ) i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail , and i am very mad about that .
1	this is also a favorite of mine . when the weather is nice , i can sit outside and listen to the song while my wife is working . this is a great song .
0	i like the music on this cd , but the cd is too big for me , i have to be careful putting it in my pocket . also after listening to a few time the song is too long and i get tired of listening to it . i would not have bought it even if it were $ 1.00 .
0	i am a huge fan of this guy . i loved his song the perfect kiss and i have to say i am blown away by the quality of his new music . the song is awesome and it is a great song . this is a great album . the only thing i did not like is that the song wa not on the cd or cd cover . it should have been .
1	this album is great . but , there is a problem with the packaging . there is a problem with the disc . i got the first copy of the album i could find , but when i listened to the second copy , the disc wa not the same . i wa very disappointed with it , so i had to throw it out .
0	i have to agree . i like this band a lot but this is my second album in three year and i am beginning to not have much interest in the band . this is the first album i purchased from the band website where i wa really interested in the music and wa looking forward to the release . this album is really good but not something i will put on repeat . i love the music , but the new material is just not a good a the old material . so i will give this album a 2.5 but it is not a great album .
1	my favorite cd of all time . great guitar work , great vocal . this album wa the perfect mix of rock and roll and country .
1	this song is a perfect example of good old-fashioned country and western , and i am a fan of the music genre . i would recommend it to anyone who like their country music with a little bit of rock .

0	this is a good album , but it is not good by any mean . i have never been a big fan of jewel music , but i am a fan of the band . i would love to have one of their album , but i do not think it is a good one .
1	i love mary voice on this . it is just a it wa on the recording . i like the change .
0	great cd , love the tune of uptown funk but the rest of the cd wa not a good a the first cd i have listen to this cd , i also like the first cd i have played this cd a lot
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i liked the video but not the song . i thought that they changed the pace a little too much and the song wa not a good a the video . i thought the first verse wa ok and then it just fell flat . the second verse wa very good and then after that i thought the third verse wa boring and then after that it just fell flat . the third part of the song wa very good and then after that it just fell flat . i thought the second part of the song wa very well done and then after that i just thought it wa too short .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	an absolute blast to listen to . a definite must have for everyones holiday music list .
1	i love everything about this song . this song is one of my favorite so far this year .

1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i enjoy it . it is simple , yet very well done . i would say the weakest thing are the instrumentals but the song are good . the band is good enough that the song stand out . the overall sound is very good .

0	i am very disappointed in the recording here . the sound is muddy , there is no emphasis on the instrument and the bass is too weak to be considered great . i am not sure how this recording will compare with other group . i only wish that it did sound a good a the recording that i have heard so far .
1	i love this song ! i love this song , i have never heard this song and i am very happy that i did ! i have always wanted to see sam sparro and this wa a very nice surprise . this song is very powerful , i think there are many people who can relate to this song . i like sam sparro because he is a very nice person and i like his style of music .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	this wa good . it wa simple and effective .
0	an excellent album that contains some great song and great musicianship . they played a lot of the song that i listen to on a regular basis , including the song love is alive , the song love is alive , and jesus love me . also included are two song , do not need a doctor and i wa a fool again , that i had never heard before i purchased this album in 1991. i also purchased the 3 cd set this is the day a few year later .

0	not exactly what i expected not sure where he got it from the song is ok but the style doe not fit the beat are very different i like the song but i would have preferred a song with a simpler beat i did not like this track and i doubt anyone else doe either .
0	she is a singer , and she is a talented woman . i love her cd , and i have the cd in my car at all time . i have gone through her cd like a record and just keep using it . i wa going to listen to her cd for fun , but i have listened to them almost every day for about 4 month now , and i must say that i am starting to wonder if jewel is going to fall off the face of the earth or something . i feel like i am having a nervous breakdown . her cd are still good , she just ha to stop singing like a pop star .
1	i am a big fan of this band . their music ha really been in my rotation for a long time . the band is from the south , so they are not from texas , i am from kentucky and i am a huge fan . this album will blow you away .
1	this song wa on tom wait first cd , which came out in 1996. it is not a bad song but i thought it wa a little cheesy . my wife wa very positive about this song . this is just a positive a it get . it ha a great melody and a great instrumentation . it ha a very nice chorus .

1	i have been using this app for a week and it is been great .
1	if you do not know the lyric to this song , you need to stop reading this review . it is not my fault . i wa trying to tell you what a great song this is . i wa listening to reo speedwagon , and i heard a song on the radio that said i can not quit you . i wa so disappointed in myself for not knowing the lyric . i quickly looked it up on my computer and found the lyric . i wa elated when i found out that the voice is john frusciante . when i listened to the song , the music and the lyric were just a perfect match . i wa completely amazed by how this song wa written . it wa so creative and so well written . i wa really amazed that john wrote this song ; it wa just perfect for the song that it wa . now i know why everyone is saying that i can not quit you . if it wa a man , i would have quit you a long time ago .
1	fantastic song .
0	i purchased this song on a whim . i saw it on the youtube and thought , i will just listen to this to find out what it is all about . it is a really good song , and i would have enjoyed it much more if it did not make me feel like i wa in a horror movie .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	i like the music very much .
1	i like this cd but i wish sam sparro would sing something that wasnt so annoying . i like the song , and the song content , but i just do not like sam voice . it sound too high , too nasal , and too repetitive . i feel like the song is missing something . it is not bad , but it is not what i would call a good example of rocker song .
1	i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the mp3s from amazon - the process is easy - the song is very melodic and it ha a little bit of emotion to it .

1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	this wa the first song i heard when i bought my first cd .
1	the only thing positive about this album is that it ha a good amount of track . the album is not packed with a good amount of track , but it still ha a decent amount of good track . the track are nothing to write home about , but the album is worth a listen .
1	my heart belongs to you is a powerful ballad about the love that one ha for a person . it ha a soft , romantic feel to it , and the word just sound wonderful .
1	this is my favorite cash song . i have never had a
0	this song is a classic in my opinion and i love it . i am not a big david lee roth fan . but he sure doe have a great voice .

0	i love this record , but the one that come in a cd case is better . they are the same , just in a cd case . this one is in a plastic bag .
0	this is not a classic prince album . it is not even a good album . it is just a bunch of song with the same instrumentation . there is only one good song , but it is not a classic .
1	i am a jazz fan and i could listen to this cd for hour and hour . tim
0	this is a bad effort by ms. ponder to promote her book . i wa hoping that the short performance of the prince of denmark would be different , but it is just an old-fashioned love song . i do not think a recording of ms. ponders voice performing the song is worth that much of a song . it wa done on a cassette recorder and would have been better off recorded in a studio . i listened to two song on this recording , but only heard one half of it . i know the prince is a popular figure , but this is just a silly effort to sell book series .
0	i am a big fan of this band . i like the way they blend a rock sound with their country and western influence . i like the lyric on this album .
0	this is so beautiful . i love it .
0	her voice is not bad , but i am not sure she is a gifted orator . i like her song , but i do not think she is a song writer .
0	it is a good song , but the last song is too fast .
1	this is my favorite song from this album .
1	this song is great ! i have not been able to play this song in a long time but when i did , i had flashback to when i wa a teen and would play it and think about everything that wa going on in my life . i would have to be able to relate to the song to know how powerful it is .
0	this is a cool song . it is got a great beat and the horn are great . it is a cool cover of a song by the dave clark five which is cool .
0	i have had a t-mobile g2 for about 6 year now . i love it . i have not had a phone since i wa an early teenager . it served me well .
1	this is one of the best jazz album of all time . the only problem is that someone ha destroyed the cd . i had it for over a year , but it never got to me . i never really thought about it , but it wa a compilation of the best jazz album from the late 20th and early 21st century . i wa surprised to see how good this album wa . i do not know when it came out . i wa amazed to hear it . the band wa so good , but it wa ruined by someone . i do not know who they
0	this song had a strong beat to it , and i thought it wa a good song , but the vocal were weak .
1	my opinion is that the song on this cd are very well written and have a good message . they are a great combination of jazz and pop . the music is also very well played and the vocal are very well sung . i am looking forward to listening to the rest of the cd .
1	this cd is really good ! i have had this cd for about 3 month . it wa just a few year old and i had to buy it . the only song i did not get through the night wa you and me which i did not know that they played . this is a really good recording of a live performance that i would have liked to have seen . i am not sure if it wa a benefit or not , but i know that they had a ton of money and i wa hoping to get a copy !
0	this is a very good album . it is not a great album ( a i would have preferred ) , but it is a good , solid disc to own .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this cd ha some really good song , but the cd cover is very generic . the cd wa nice to look at and the song sounded very good , but not great .
0	i like the song on this cd . the cd is great . i do not like any of the song . the only thing i do not like about this cd is how long it is .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this is easily the worst song on the album . the lyric are bad , the beat and the instrumentation is bad , and the singing is bad . there are several time in the song where the male singer start out singing in the second person , but then switch to first person and then back to second . i do not even know what the point of this is .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	the song are well written and the production is top notch .
1	it wa a good album , but i think it could have been better but i liked it .
1	this is not worth listening to . not much good there .
1	i have just gotten my copy of this cd - it is very good . i really like this cd . i play it on my ipod . i do not know if i will buy it again . i like the song candyland - but i do not really like the rest of the song . i hate the song that have the same chord over and over again . some song i like but others i do not .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i really like this song and the vocal are pretty good . i think it is a good song , but the sound is a little too rock for me .
1	i had this album for over a year . i loved it . then i got this other one . i like the first one better . but i think i will get rid of the first one .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . it ha excellent song choice . i love the song amazing grace , i will be there when you call , and in the name of the lord . i do not like that one song on the album , i am a man . however , i will listen to any album i can get my hand on , and i will not let that one stop me from buying this album .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i am a huge fan of the pogues and thought this wa a good song . the song is a tribute to my mother and the song is called the last goodbye . it is a very emotional song and would make for a good funeral . i will continue to listen to the pogues . you are good for me . i hope your label is a good a mine . i would still buy your cd if it wa not for the discontinuation of your record label . i think you will be sorry . i hope your label doe not go under . i hope your label is still around when you finish the cd . thanks . i hope your label is still around when i finish the cd . i will buy your cd if it wa not for the discontinuation of your record label . i am a huge fan of the pogues and thought this wa an excellent song . your music is great . thanks . i love your music . i will continue to listen to your music . thanks for listening . the pogues is great . you are great . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for playing . thanks for buying . thanks for giving . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for buying . thanks for listening . thanks for buying . thanks for playing . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for getting here . thanks for buying . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for listening . thanks for buying . thanks for reading . thanks for listening . thanks for playing . thanks for reading . thanks for buying . thanks for playing . thanks for reading . thanks for playing . thanks for listening . thanks for buying . thanks for listening . thanks for playing . thanks for listening . thanks for playing . thanks for buying . thanks for listening . thanks for listening . thanks for playing . thanks for playing . thanks for listening . thanks for listening . thanks for buying . thanks for buying . thanks for listening . thanks for getting here . thanks for buying . thanks . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for reading . thanks for buying . thanks for buying . thanks for reading . thanks for reading . thanks for playing . thanks for reading . thanks for listening . thanks for reading . thanks for the info . thanks for playing . thanks for listening . thanks for the info . thanks for playing . thanks . thanks for listening . thanks for the info . thanks . thanks for the info . thanks . thanks for reading . thanks for reading . thanks . thank you for listening . thanks . thanks for the info . thanks . thank you for reading . thanks . thanks for listening . thanks . thanks for the info . thanks for listening . thanks for the info . thanks you for reading . thanks for the info . thanks for the info . thanks for reading . thanks for the info . thanks you for reading . thank you for playing . thanks . thanks for paying . thanks for listening . thanks for listening . thank you for reading . thanks for reading . thanks for playing . thank you for playing . thanks for reading . thanks for reading . thanks for listening . thanks for your support . thank you for reading . thank you . thanks . thanks for everything . thanks for everything . thanks for everything . thanks . thanks for reading . thanks . thanks for everything . thanks . thanks for everything . thanks for everything .

0	i wa really excited about this album when it first came out . it wa my favorite album of the year so far . i wa really excited to find out that she did not write any of the song on it . i wa disappointed when i found out that she wrote them . some of the song are not very good but i still like them . i like the music on the album though . i wa really excited to find out that she wa writing song . i did not expect her to write any on this album . i really liked it . i thought the album wa excellent . it wa very good . i thought the song were very good . i really like the album . i like it . i will continue to listen to her music . she seems to have a good voice and she ha good song . i did not like the song on this album . i do not think this album is not very good but i will continue to listen to her music . i think the album is very good and i hope that she will write more . i hope she continues to write song .

1	i love it !
0	i purchased this after seeing this review on the web . i wa very disappointed with the performance . i did not get the song , but it sounded very bad , with lot of background noise .
0	this is the cd everyone is talking about . dave clark is one of those rare singer who can truly sing his own song , but with the help of his band on this set , he is able to create his own sound .
1	i like lareiner a lot . it is a good song .
1	j. ponder is a talented guitarist , who ha a sound that is different from that of most of the musician in the music business . listener often comment how different his playing is from most of the musician .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i like the song , but i do not think it is a good a some of his other song . it ha a good beat , though .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i bought this book in the hope that it would be a fun read . i wa wrong . this is a beautiful collection that is filled with great music . i have listened to all the album in this collection and i am now a fan of the work of michel legrand , robert schumann , and sergei rachmaninoff . i would suggest that anyone who love classical music , and especially those who love jazz , should purchase this book . it is a wonderful collection and it will make a wonderful gift .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	[ brandy ]
0	this is a new release by the dave clark five . it is very good .
0	i like the song the glory of god and the song unleashed very much . i am not a fan of the song amen the song i will not like is the song praise is what i do the song is not great . i do not know why ponder wrote this song . it doe not have a great message or even a good message . the song is just a bad song .
0	i like listening to this music . i like the album .
1	i love it .
1	i would like to see if this could be a part of a movie made by a band . it seems funny now , but this band had such a great talent . the way they wrote , it made me want to live life the same way . i really love this album . i will buy everything by them .
0	i like to listen to the music i buy . this is a good country music album !
1	this song is an amazing song . i really like it .
1	i like this cd . i have listened to it several time over the past few week . i like it , but i do have a few niggles . first , i wa under the impression that the album had been delayed since it had been available for a while . when i found out that it had not , i wa not happy . i wa hoping to get a copy for my son , so i can bring him to see the show . i am disappointed that all the cd i have seen have been sold out , but i have not given up hope . i will probably buy another .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i really love this album . i have loved all of them since i first heard this album . i love this album .
1	this song message is very powerful . it is a great song to sing when you need to be reminded that god is in control .
0	i bought every album by the same band , and i have yet to find one that i liked , this one is the best so far . it is a very good album , i will be buying the next one .
1	this song is awesome
1	great harmony super fourties group

1	i have just moved to a new town . i wa looking for a place to live and found this place . i asked to rent the place for three week a my friend wa moving in . in his previous apartment which wa in the same building , he had a small apartment , but in this place , there is a huge one room apartment . the woman who answered at the door had a very strange look on her face and she told me to come back tomorrow because she wa moving out . when i returned the next day , she gave me the same excuse . i went and asked the landlord , and he told me the apartment wa full . i asked him to give it to me a he said he would but he said i could not because it wa full . he said he needed more space . i then asked him to give me the whole apartment because i wa paying $ 1200 for the one room apartment . he said he wa not moving out . he said he needed more space and i could not rent it because it wa full . i asked him why wa i paying $ 1200 for the one room apartment . he said because he wa paying $ 1200 for it and that is the only reason why he wa giving it to me . he said he could only give it to me because i had a car and he needed the space . i told him i did not have a car and he said he thought i did because he wa not moving out . i asked him to give it to me because i had a car and he said he would if i would come back tomorrow and he gave me the apartment . i told him i had a car , but he said he would give it to me because he needed the space . i went back the next day and the landlord told me he had forgotten to give me the money . i told him i wanted to move in and he said i could not because he needed more space . i told him i had a car and he said he would give it to me because he needed the space . he said he needed more space , he had more room on the top floor of the building , and i needed it because i had a car , but i told him i did not have a car and he said i could have the space because i had a car . i asked him why he needed more room on the top floor of the building and he said he had a bigger car . i told him i did have a car . he said he needed to have a bigger car to get to his job which is on the top floor of the building . i told him i did have a big car and he said he needed a bigger car . he said he needed a bigger car to get to work and he need it to get to his work . i told him i did have a big car , but i did not have a bigger car to get to his work . he said i needed a bigger car to get to my job and he need the space . i asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his job and he said he needed the space . i told him i did not have a bigger car and he said i could have the space because i had a car , and he gave me the apartment . i asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to my job and he said it wa to get to his job . i told him i did not have a bigger car and he said he needed the space because he needed the space . he said he needed more room on the top floor to get to his work . i told him i did have a bigger car and he said he needed a bigger car because his car is bigger . i asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his work and he said he need a bigger car . he asked me to come back the next day and he gave it to me . i told him i did have a bigger car and he said he could not give it to me because he needed the space . i told him i had a big car , but he said his car wa bigger . i told him i had a big car , but i did not have a bigger car to get my job done . he said he needed the space . he said he needed more room on the top level of the building to get to his job . i told him i did have a big car , but i did have a bigger car to get my job done . he said he need a bigger car to get to his work . i asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his office and he said he needed a bigger car to get to his job . i asked him why he needed a bigger car to get to his other job
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is one of my favorite dave clark five song !
0	i am in a little bit of a crunch at the moment ( on top of the cd ) so i decided to pick up a copy of the cd to try and fill in a few gap .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is a pleasant compilation of popular song and song that are well known , but not a well known a the one it contains . i enjoy the variety of artist that are represented here , and the fact that i can tell story and have fun with the song .
1	i just love this song . it is a great song . thanks for the review .
0	they put on a good show . i wa not able to catch it live , but i am hoping to be able to watch it on dvd . i loved everything about it ! i wa able to catch the whole concert . it wa totally worth the price of admission .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	the first time i listened to this song , i thought it wa great . i really did not think it wa a gnr song , but i liked the song . i thought it wa a great song and i think it wa great when i first heard it . now , i think it suck . there is no way i would ever give this record the time of day . it is like the greatest song ever , but it is just a joke . i guess i will never be able to appreciate this band because i will never like a gnr song . i will never be able to listen to a gnr song because this song is just a joke . it make me want to put this record on the top of my list of greatest song ever . it make me want to punch someone . it is just a joke . this is a joke . it is just a joke .
1	not a fan of this album but i will say it ha some nice song . i do not listen to the music enough to rate it , but i enjoy it . i listened to it a few time and can not wait for more .
0	i have been a fan of the beatles since i wa a little kid-but not this one . it ha always annoyed me that they went through all the trouble ( including recording in a studio ) just to release a really bad album . i mean really , this one is good , but not great .
1	this song ha an amazing beat and it is a good song .
0	i do not know what is worse , the cd or the lyric to the song . i am sure i will never know , because they are terrible . the lyric are horrible and do not even make sense . i will tell you what , i do not know who wrote this cd . i am just glad i have a cd player .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i love the song and the video . it make me feel very warm and comfortable . i love the way she sings . it is so nice to listen to .
1	i listen to this album so much . i really like it ! i would recommend this album to all tom wait fan .
0	i love this song- it ha a very unique beat and it is very catchy . i love the new singer and the chorus is very catchy . i would recommend this song to anyone who like christmas music .
0	i like the beethoven 9th and this cd . i like the variety of artist that are represented here , but i would not buy this cd .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i do not understand why i can not get this cd on my ipod .
1	i love this song . i believe it is one of the greatest american love song of all time . i can not wait until it is on the radio .
0	this song wa on the radio and it wa one of my favorite . it wa very catchy .
0	i love dave clark five . i love their music .
0	this good , but i like the first part . the second part is not really good .
1	i have been waiting for this album to come out for a long time and now i have got it . i love prince and this album is one of his best album .
1	i am a huge fan of the old-timey , country and western sound . i love the way these song have no pretension . i am glad i found this album .
0	this album is a great album , and is my favorite from the series so far . i love all the song on the album , and the track are great . i am not an electronic music fan . i listen to a lot of classic rock and blue . this album is great .
0	i know this album is not a bonnie tatum cd , but i would love to see bonnie tatum perform live . i like her album and all of her cd . i love the song .
1	an excellent album from one of the greatest trance producer in the world . i love the way she writes . she always writes song that are original and interesting , which is what i want in a trance album . if i had to say what i like about this album , it is the quality of the production and the quality of the song . i like the song that are a little bit different from the usual trance song . i also like the way that she mix the song . she doe not have a lot of song that are boring or repetitive . her album seem to get better and better . this album really is one of the best trance album , if not the best trance album . it is the best trance album from a female producer that i have heard . i do not think this album will be around for very long . i would like to find a copy , but i do not think that i will ever find one .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this song wa always one of my favorite . i had to buy this for my husband . he is a huge fan of the song . he wanted to know the story behind the song . i am glad he enjoyed the song .
1	i listen to jewel at least once a week . this is the first live
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is a nice version of a folk song . i love it !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i love this album . i have listened to it several time . i really like it . i can not say enough good thing about this album .
1	a a person that love musical theater , i am always looking for something new to listen to . this is a new song that i am finding myself enjoying . i like the way the song is sung and the song itself . it is a good song to sing and sing along with your family or with a crowd . a definite must buy .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i like the song , it is not a classic rock album , but it is very well made . i like the cover .
1	this is one of the best song ever . i will definitely put it on the radio , so it is a great song
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i am a sam sparro fan . i love his music . i also like to listen to music that ha good lyric . i have listened to many music album that have good lyric and this is one of them .

0	i love all the song on this cd . i really love the message that is being put out by the artist .
1	this is an outstanding collection of the best song from the late 70 , early 80 that is on cd and lp . the album great song include in the air tonight by stevie nick , shout by van morrison , all because of you by hall and oates , one by paul simon , i could have
0	i wa looking for a music to play on my ipod and i found this one . it a good song and i am looking forward to the next one .
0	i love this album . the song are so soothing . i like the band bette midler . i have bought the cd many time , and i like it very much . it is very calming .
1	the cd is awesome ! the sound quality is excellent . i can not believe that the band did not release this in a cd format . they should have done an ep with the song from the cd . this is an album that you will want to buy !
1	this song really ha a good message .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	that is right , it is about a little girl who is a princess and like to take picture with her camera and when her mom say no she say , i am a photographer and they laugh at her and she say do not you know who i am ? my name is gretchen , mommy . it is a funny song , and i do like the song , but unfortunately it is a waste of time .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	just what i wanted , a new prince album , a lot of the song are good .
0	this song is a total rip-off of do not stop believin . i wa really pissed and i wa going to email her but it wa too late , because she deleted her email .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i got this album for my son christmas gift . it is a great christmas album . the song are very well done . they are all great . i love maria voice . the arrangement are all great and very well done . it is an excellent , wonderful album .
1	i recently bought the beautiful life cd . thank you for allowing me to get this cd .
0	i find it hard to believe that this collection of recording wa released a a box set in the first place . this collection of recording is the best thing that i have heard in a long time . i have listened to this collection of recording a thousand time and still have not decided if it worth getting a box set . i have listened to this collection of recording a thousand time and still have not decided if it worth getting a box set .
1	this is a very good song ! i like mileys voice and the lyric on this song are very well thought out . it is a nice addition to anyones collection .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i bought the cd for my son , who is 5 year old . he like music . he would not like this cd . it is not very good . i would not buy it again . i would get fool for love by alanis morissette . i would give it a 3 .
0	she is a great singer and a nice addition to any song list
1	i love to dance to this song .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i like the song . i do not know why it wa not listed a a best seller , but i like it . i can not wait to buy it .
0	i would rate this album a 3/5 star .
0	she can write song better than i can . she writes the lyric well .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	i love these song and can not get over how good they are - i do not care if they are just a little different , it just work . and they are good .
1	this is the best album in my opinion to date . the lyric are very good and the music is good . the album is great overall .
1	i think this is a very good album . it wa good , not great , but good . i do not understand why so many people hate it .
0	this is a really great song ! i also heard it when i wa in the shower , and i think i can dance to it while i am driving or doing anything . it is a great song and i really like the lyric .
1	this album is just awesome . the song are all worship related . i love listening to worship song that are uplifting and encouraging . i would recommend this album if you are a fan of praise and worship music . this album is awesome !

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .

0	i wa looking for a cd to listen to while i wa in the truck . i really enjoyed the cd , but i think i will have to put it back . it is not loud enough to use on the truck , so i will use it while driving and just turn the volume up a little . i think it is good , but i like rap better .
1	although it is not my favorite grateful dead cd , the first cd i ever bought ( when i wa 14 ) wa this one and i am still very glad i bought it . i have listened to it a few time since , and it is now one of my top favorite . it is a very relaxing cd and it is nice to listen to . the only thing i wish is that the second cd would be the same a the first cd , but since i have no idea what the second cd is , it is not that important .

1	i just finished watching the show and watching sam doing the song rise up which is awesome . i will be buying this cd from now on .
1	i like the song but it is not very good . the lyric are not that great , and the song is not very good . the backing melody is annoying and i hate the way the song is played . it sound like a bunch of kid shouting at the top of their voice . it is just annoying and terrible .

0	this is by far one of the best indie rock album that i have ever heard . i love the music , the song , the whole album . i will never listen to a bad indie rock album again .
0	i wa a little put off by the all-inclusive version . i feel like it would be great on a cd where the artist ha the opportunity to cover any song they want . i am not sure if i get the point of releasing a cd with all the song a all-inclusive and you have to buy the song you want . this is not that song though . i am not sure if i get the point of selling a cd with all the song in it . i think i will download all the song i want .
0	this song is a little hard to listen to , but it is very good . i prefer listening to new artist that do not sound like other people . miley cyrus doe not sound like miley cyrus . i do not even remember the last time i heard a song with the lyric i am a girl , so i do not listen to any song like this . the song is very good , but i prefer something else from her .
0	i saw last night broadway production of fiddler on the roof . it wa a very good show , but i wasnt able to get into it . it wa very very slow . the production of the show wa a mess . it take a long time to get into the show . the actor are very good , but i thought the show did not move very well . i hope they fix it soon .
0	this is their worst album ever . it is boring , it is repetitive and the lyric are lame , and they are really just bad . they have the worst singer ever and i do not think the song have any substance . i have already had my money wasted on this album . if i could give gnr some shit i would . they are horrible . they put out some horrible music . they suck . they use a lot of the same singer over and over and over again . i am not a gnr fan . i hate them . i hated jj jam but i still bought it . it wa good . they make this album and i do not like it .
0	all i can say is larein is an extremely bad song .
1	i really like the album , and have listened to it on and off . it is not a jazz concert , but a love letter to the music .
1	[ guitar hero : aerosmith ] play guitar hero !
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	the only song i like on this list .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .

0	i like the guitar solo .
1	i like this song . it ha a good beat .
0	the first thing that struck an eye wa the lack of rhythm . the vocal are in there but the music is choppy and out of sync . the second thing wa the lack of the song that the band ha been playing and singing for the last 10 year . it is the song that we all grew up on that have been played and sung for so long . this is like having the same beatles song played over and over and over and over again . the lyric are simple and the vocal seem monotonous . the melody are repetitive and do not have any depth to them . when i first heard this cd i wa really impressed but after listening to it a few time i find it lacking . i am not sure what the point of this cd is unless it is to drive you crazy .

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	i think this is the best album ! i just love it . this is the best album !
0	this album is not bad , but it is far from my favorite , either .
0	i liked the band , but it doe not have a good enough song structure to be a contender for best of . i also found a few annoying melody .
0	i have downloaded this album several time . it is very disappointing ( if you need a recommendation for a bad album , go for this one . ) the vocal are horrible . the song are generic and repetitive . the only redeeming feature is that it wa the first album by the new band . that said , i still would not buy it .
1	i have always loved music and love to find the rare one . i like the beatles , but a far a i know they do not have an album available in the u . my first ever purchase wa a beatles album , but my favorite wa sgt . pepper lonely heart club band . i think this is the best one i have ever owned . the beatles are my favorite band .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i love this song and i love the cover art . it is an old classic that seems to be everywhere . the song is very cool and i love it . i do not know what i think of the vocal .
0	i thought this cd wa just ok. not bad , but not good either . i like the beautiful and praise god cd better . i have praise god on my ipod . i like the song praise god better . i can not listen to this cd all the time , but i do like it when i am in the car driving around . if i am in a big shopping mall or a concert , i have to wait till i am done shopping or listening to a concert to listen to the cd .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	very good , but very short . overall a good song .
1	i love the song .
1	i am really curious about god people , and i have to admit that i did not want to listen to this album . i am not a typical christian , but i like the music of the christian world and i am interested in what happens in the christian world . i found it very interesting . it is not very long , so you can listen to it in a few sitting .
1	this wa the first tape i ever bought , and i really enjoyed it . this is a good tape to get a person mind off of thing .
1	i am not a big fan of the video , but i am glad to listen to it . i do not know anything about her music , but it is a good song . the lyric are actually kind of catchy .
0	i don ; t know what they are talking about . i do not think you need to know what the movie is , but it would help if you did . and i do not understand why you say it is the same song when it really is not . maybe i am not understanding what you are saying .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i am a fan of this band . the lead singer ha a fine voice and play a mean guitar . and this cd is great .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i love the song and the movie , but i hate the book ! not the music , the story is interesting . the music is beautiful , but the story is wrong .
0	i can only listen to this cd when i am alone .
1	i bought this cd to listen to it . i like dave clark five .
0	i think the song is pretty much perfect for this movie , and i also think that the movie is well worth it and that the music fit the mood perfectly . the movie is about a father who go to a concert in which a guy who wa an astronaut and a musician get killed so that his wife doe not lose her job . the wife , who wa also an astronaut , is heartbroken over what happened and decides that she is going to get drunk and become a recluse to escape the pain . the father and his wife go to the concert and get drunk , and the father is killed when he fall off the stage . the mother dy of a heart attack in the bathroom and the father wife dy in her apartment .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i went out and bought this album because i wanted to see her live . i listened to it and i love it . i am not a big fan of her music but i love to listen to hers . i am really glad i bought it .
0	i love this album . if you enjoy indie rock you will love this . the only reason i gave it a 2 star ( it is really not that bad ) is because some of the track have been replaced by others i did not like .
1	this song is good .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	this is not a bad cover . it is a pretty good cover of the song . i think this cover is a little too much for it is own good . i do not care for the original song so i can understand why you would want a cover of it to accompany it . i also like the original a little more .
0	i like this one even though my kid hated it . i used to think it wa one of the better song but i am not sure anymore it is just not my favorite . i always liked it though and wish i could get it in another format for my son and grandson .
0	the only good song on the album is if i had a gun ( hallelujah ) , which is very powerful and inspiring , and is the only song that really show that she can sing . but i am alright sound terrible and ha no emotion . the album is very much like a poor version of the best of both world .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this is better than the original album . it wa very good .
0	this song is a great song in my opinion ! the singer , miley cyrus ha a great voice , and the video is quite beautiful , but this song is terrible .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	i am a very happy woman . this song is great . i love the lyric .
0	i have just started listening to the cd and i love it !
0	this is an excellent album . the quality of her voice is not really what i expected . it is more like she is a little girl with a beautiful voice .
1	this is an excellent cd player . i had a lot of trouble getting it to work with my ipod . my husband tried , and i went out and bought another one ( to replace it ) . this one work great , and is easily installed .
1	i love the e.s . posthumus cd , but i do not think i will ever buy another by this band . the song suck . the lyric suck . the band suck . this album is a waste of money .
1	i have heard she is very talented . i never thought she would be a singer . i thought she wa just a comedian . i have listened to most of her song and i can tell she ha a big voice . her voice is really powerful and she is very talented . i love her music a lot .
1	i love it .
0	this is a great album .
0	very happy to see this song back again . i used to not like this song but now i like it a lot .

0	i think this song is a great song , i like the music i am listening to , and i like the lyric . the only thing i do not like about the song is that it is repetitive , and it get boring after awhile . it is a great song , and i love the music , but it is repetitive after awhile .
0	i have been listening to this album for about 15 minute . i can not even say that i like it , but i like it . it is a little bit like listening to one of those crap album that is the worst thing you have listened to in your life . i know that it is not the best album i have heard , but it is still good . i can not say that i do not like it . i like the music , but i do not know that i will listen to it again . i am not sure , i am just not sure what to say . and i am not sure how to explain it . i think that i will wait to listen to the rest of the album . i am not sure what to say . i am just not sure what to say . i am not sure what to think .

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .

1	this is the first prince cd i have bought in my life . i love prince and have been listening to him since the album let u go crazy wa released . i wa wondering if i could find one of his new album before everyone else . i have looked on amazon for prince and none of them had anything in them for me . so i went to the music store and found this one , and i love it ! i just bought it a soon a i finished listening to it . i have been listening to this record for 3 hour straight now . i wa just about to order another cd to listen to . i can not wait to listen to it again .
1	this song rock .
0	i have found this album to be extremely interesting , and i am glad i have bought it a soon a i received it . it is an interesting mix of musical style , and it is good for those who like the country , blue , and rock . i have been listening to the album a lot lately .
0	i am just a little disappointed , but i have to say that i still love the band and i am happy they have released this cd . i have several copy of it and i only listen to it at random . it is just some of the greatest music ever .
1	i am in love with this album . i would not even consider to buy another album by the same artist for the entire year .
0	this is the only cd collection i have ever seen that really ha all of the great performer i have been looking for . i am so glad i gave this collection a try . it may be my new favorite cd and it is definitely worth the money .
0	it is a great cd for the choir , but not good for the average person .
1	i bought this album .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is a beautiful version of the steve morse classic , the hammond organ collection . if you enjoy the late 70s/early 80 , this is a must buy .
1	i have only heard mister x once . it is got the best organ part i have heard in any of his record .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i would recommend this album to any fan of old-timey , country music . i love the sound of the 78 track a well a the song .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did not , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you the back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this is my favorite song that i have heard since i heard it on the radio in 1990. it is so catchy and ha such great lyric . i love it !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	this is really a great song .
0	this is a very good , solid album that sound like it wa recorded at a studio . great vocal . lyric are great , but the playing is very tight . the production is fine . it just doe not quite match up with the quality of the song . i give it a 3 star rating .
1	i like the song , but i do not like the song .
1	i downloaded all the song on this cd . i found some i did not know about and wanted to listen to them .
0	i like this album . the sound quality is good , but the track are all the same , so you will only have one good track . i could really use some more variety in the track , but other than that , i have really enjoyed listening to this album .
0	i have not heard this one yet . it look like it is about being in love and a guy who is in love is too afraid to tell his lady that he love her . so he wait until they are apart to tell her and then he run in her house and try to kill himself . so the lady in the song is like , oh my god , you did not tell me that you loved me .
1	this song is so overplayed at the gym that it is now a joke ! if this were the kind of song that you would hear in a film to create a theme or background music , i would be more understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for the opening chord ) , which get no applause ! you are lucky to get a grunt !
0	this album is a great song , but i can not stand the sound on the album . the sound is so distorted , and it make the song hard to understand .
1	i first heard this song in my early teen . it wa one of the best song i ever heard . the lyric made me feel like i wa in a movie theater and being entertained . i loved it . i still love it .
0	i really do not understand the hate that this album get . i like it quite a lot . i am the first to say what good album have a bad sound . this album is not a bad live album . the best song are the one from the first two or three . the rest of the album is boring .
1	this song is so beautiful . it really get to me . i love the lyric of the song .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i have been following sam sparro for a long time and his music is awesome . i have had his cd before and am looking forward to his new cd .
1	steve morse and pete knopfel are the king of the guitar
0	i found this cd to be very repetitive and stupid .
1	i love this song . i have never heard this song before , but i love it .
0	i have been a fan of this band for many year . i will admit i wa not a fan of their live show until the last tour . they are now back with their new album and i am really happy to see that they are not abandoning the fan . i have been a fan of the band since their first album in 1982. they are one of my favorite . i do not know why they had to leave so much money on the table to make a bad album that is not worth the money . i hope they make some good music in the future .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this album is just a compilation of song from their previous album . but it is a good album . the song are good , and there are some good bass solo . i think this album is a good album , and it is not a good album for this band . the song are good , and there are some good bass solo , but there are no good drum beat , which is not a good album for this band . the song are good , but the lyric are not good . i would not recommend this album .
0	it is a good album , but it is not a good a her previous album .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	the only thing i will say about this album is that it is very very very good . i like the way the vocal are arranged . the only problem is that once you get started listening to it , you will probably want to turn it off . the only reason i can give my rating is that it might be good for a few people , but will not be for others .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i can not believe this album is still out . i do not think the beatles will ever make another album again . i do not think they will ever make another album that is over 20 track long . it is just over . i think there is only one beatles song on here that i like . i can not believe that i am not sure why they put it on the album . love me do is a decent song , but they could have put that one on their next album .
1	i do not know who she is , or what her name is , but she ha a good voice and great song . i like her style .
1	love this band , like them on facebook , and i am glad i bought this album !
1	i thought this wa going to be some sort of digital synth . i wa wrong . this is very nice and i would like to know why it is called cobalt
0	i love her music . i agree with the other reviewer here . i would have bought this album for myself if i had it , but i do not .
0	this song doe not make me feel any different .
0	not a great album but there are some good song .
0	i really want to buy this album but i do not like it . i do not understand why people would want to listen to this .
0	for a while i looked forward to seeing this artist . i wa looking forward to her cd . but , i did not buy them . i did not like her music . i do not understand the lyric . i can not relate to the lyric . i did not have a strong opinion of her cd before . now , i am not even sure if i like them . the only reason i bought them is because i heard she would be performing in my town . that wa the only reason i bought them . i listened to them in my car . it would be a waste of money to buy one of her cd . i have not bought any of her cd . but , i still think she is an amazing artist .
0	i did not like this cd . i listened to it for the first time while listening to the radio . i really do not like the song i am free by miley cyrus . it is just too much yelling . i think there are other song that are better . this cd is one of the worst cd i have ever listened to .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this is a really good album that is worth the money . i love the album . i have loved every album by this band . i think this is one of my all time favorite .
0	i love the way she sings this song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	is a very good song , it is a very good song .
1	a great album ( and cd ) and this is the best way to spend your money and to support a great band ! i am not sure whether this is a good band or not , but they are good .
1	the song is very good . i like it when it is a bit slower .
0	i am glad to hear she is still writing song , even though this cd is not a good one .
0	i have not listened to this album in a while . i bought it for christmas and i am not really one for my christmas shopping , but i like the cover .
1	this song is a little disappointing . i expected more from her . i think the song is well-written ( for a girl singer ) , but the lyric are a bit cliche .
0	i have to say i enjoyed this album , the main thing i wa disappointed in wa that the lyric for the most part do not match the music . it is a lot easier to sing along to the lyric than the music .
1	this one is not bad , but it never made any impression on me . i have never been a big fan , but i thought it wa decent . i remember listening to it with a friend and he loved it , but i did not . i still can not get into it , but i like it enough to buy it . i am not sure if i have heard it before , but i think it is on the the best of cd , but i can not tell for sure . i will probably put this on the to buy list , but i am not sure it is worth buying every time i hear it .
0	i have tried to listen through all of his album , but i just do not understand what the fuss is about . i do like the first couple of track , but a soon a i get to the 2nd set , i begin to lose interest . i would go back and listen to the album again , but i have heard it so many time , i do not remember it at all . if i had to pick one album to listen to over and over , it would be this one . it is a shame that i will never have this album .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i really love this album . this is the best beatles album . it is the best beatles album that make you feel happy . the beatles are great .
1	i like the movie version a lot better , but this version is pretty good .
0	i love the lyric , but the way she sings them is all wrong . kind of off key . she sings a little high , and a little low . she also sings over the line a lot . this album is good for what it is , but i do not think it will stand out much in the cd world .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i like e.s . posthumus best of all the cd that i have received . it ha great music and picture . i have not been disappointed yet .
0	i don´t know why this cover suck . it is actually pretty good .
1	i love marie osmond . i think she is a very good artist .
0	i have been a fan of jewel music for more than 20 year . the dave clark five are my favorite band ; i just can not stand their current discography . i hate that they have been allowed to keep going with this same material that ha little or no redeeming value . the worst thing about it is that they have been so successful . if they kept at it , they could be huge . it is time for them to retire .
1	i have a great love for great music . i love this album . but i am not a big fan of the music industry . i have to be very careful with what i listen to . this album is just way too much . i can not stand it .
0	i do not know what to think about this song . i wa listening to it in the car and then i wa listening to the same song on the radio . it wa still good .
1	this is a really great album . i had heard of posthumus before but had never heard of him until i started to listen to this album . he is a brilliant guitarist , and play with a great feel for the music he is playing . i really like his playing and the way he us his guitar . the song he play are very catchy and enjoyable to listen to . i really like the way that he play , and it ha a great feel to it . this album really make me want to play guitar , and i would recommend this to anyone who would like to listen to music .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this song is a great song . i love this song . i am always singing it in the shower .
0	this collection is great , the only down fall is that the song were not long enough . the only complaint is that they did not have the song in the order i thought they should have been in . the performance were good and the song are worth hearing .
0	i am not a fan of this album . it is not a good song or a good album . it is not a good album to listen to . this song is annoying .
1	i wa wondering how i got on to this . i wa not surprised . this is a big seller and i expect it to keep in it top 10 seller for some time .
1	“ it is the music of my soul . i am thankful to god for bringing me to the place where i can appreciate music and appreciate my own voice. ” i like this music . it is not easy to write lyric to music but i know the effort and time it take to write lyric to music that is of great beauty . the lyric in this music are meaningful and meaningful to me . i love this music .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	great song . i love it . the lyric are very catchy .
1	i love the original cd . this cd is better . it ha a better sound . it is a better cd . it is better musically . i love the original cd , but this is a better cd . i love this cd because it is a better cd . i love this cd because it is a better cd . i love this cd because it is a better cd . i love r. kelly music . i love r. kelly music . i love r. kelly .
0	the song are good , but most of them are one dimensional . most of the song are good , but the three song that are not are very , very bad . the song are good , but the song are poor .
0	i really did not expect this album . i did not like it .
1	i wa hoping for something more than just a concert cd . this is a great cd .
0	i do not like it . i can not understand the lyric . the music is fine , but the song just doe not make sense to me .
0	not the one when i wa little .
0	it is a bit depressing . this is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . hasselvander writes that he is a musician and want to present the music so that you can enjoy it . he doe not seem to know how to put it together . not a good record for someone that is actually interested in music . a waste of time and a waste of money .
1	i ordered this from amazon . it wa on the original list of cd i ordered , but it wasnt on the list when i went to check the cd out . this is the first time i have ever had this happen with any cd . i ordered this cd , but i do not remember buying it . i do not remember when it wa delivered . i would have paid a great deal more for the cd if i had known it would be on the original list of cd i ordered . i would have paid more , but i would not have gotten it . i am not sure it would have been worth it , but i am not sure it would have been worth it if i had known it would be on the original list of cd i wa ordering . it is obviously a false advertisement .
1	i have listened to this cd a few time and always enjoy it , although i get a little tired of sam singing .
1	this is a good song . it is a very good song .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	this is a very easy listening cd , but the cd ha a lot of good thing . the cd doe not take itself too seriously , which is a great idea . i do not understand why they are selling it a a single cd , and they have sold over 10,000 copy . i can not believe that someone actually listens to this recording . i do not know which one is which . i do not even know which one is the best . this cd is not worth the $ 14.95 . it is just a waste of money . i would rather just send it back , a i would rather send it back and buy the next one . there are a lot of mistake , and it is very hard to understand what they are trying to say with this recording and with the singing . the singing is very bad , and it is hard to understand what they are trying to say . i do not understand why they would go through the effort . i do not understand why they would go through the effort . it is a shame . i wa looking for a song i had heard several time and , lo & behold , i found it on this cd ! a a matter of fact , i have listened to this cd several time , and i have not yet found a song i like . i bought this and the 4 previous one a part of an extensive series , and i have no idea which one is which . i do not know what they are trying to sell with this series of cd . it is a shame . i wa looking for a song that i had heard several time , and i found it on this cd !
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	it is a great cd for the choir , but not good for the average person
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	i think i agree with the majority of review . tom wait music is not great . it is okay , but not great . i am not really a wait fan , but i will put this on . it is a good album though .
1	i love this song !
0	for a while i wa hoping to buy a copy . but , i wa not lucky . i am a fan of bonnie tatum and the album all alone with something to say . her song are so beautiful and heart touching . i can not wait for the next album .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	music brings me back to my most important relationship .
0	it is a good song . i like this song , although it is not the best .

1	i think they are great . i like all their album .
1	it is one of my favorite song . it is so simple , but every time i hear it , i find myself singing along . i also like the fact that it is not a duet , and it is not a duet that you can not sing along with .
1	i am not a fan of the lyric , but it doe have a nice beat .
1	i love her voice and the song is beautiful .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .

1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this cd is a really good song . it is a little out of key . it is not outstanding . the only reason it is worth a rating is because it is free and it is the story of a christmas carol . otherwise i would give it a negative review . it ha a strong melody that can be enjoyed by many people . the lyric are silly . the sound quality is excellent ; the song is very clear . the only problem is the vocal . they are just terrible . the song is very hard on the ear . the cd quality is good . the music is well-crafted and the song is very enjoyable . it ha great lyric . this cd ha a good sound quality . the cd is easy to listen to . there are some good lyric . the cd is worth the money . after listening to this cd for a little while i feel like i have learned something . i give it a rating of 5 star .
1	this album is amazing . the only problem is that it is very expensive . the song are very good . they are very different from each other . some of the song are very long and some are just one or two line long . the music is very good and the lyric are also very good . i really like the song in this album . there are a lot of good song in this album . the only problem with this album is that it is a very expensive album . it is not an inexpensive album . it is a very good album . i would recommend this album to anyone who like classical music . i

0	i wa expecting a lot from an album by a guy who ha been in the music industry for a good 40 year ; however , this album is not what i expected . with song like alligator , pussy , mysterious , a thousand year , and i am not going anywhere , i felt that the album did not live up to the expectation i had of it .

1	it is a great album . it reminds me of the old glam/rock song . i found this album while surfing the net for pop-rock/glam song . there are a few song that are a little repetitive but that is what make it so great . i love the lyric . i wish they would release a new one .
0	i am not sure why they have this here , but it is not listed in the review .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

1	this second album by this band
1	i am an old school music lover . i love the classic . i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajian from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerising . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped from the orchestra . it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence . that is , the sound is now buried to it very core . it is in moment like this when the listener is treated to something truly memorable .
1	i love this cd . it is a very relaxing and pleasant cd to listen to . i have many relaxing cd and this cd is my first choice for relaxing .
1	the best cover i have seen yet . i have been waiting to buy this for about three month now .
1	the last thing you wanted to do wa to fall apart . but it happened . and it is killing me .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	very bad song . the dave clark five are one of the best band ever . i do not understand how this song is on the top 100. it is just a bunch of noise . i do not know how they found it , but it is a great song , i like it . i do not like the video though .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i have to say , i have never had a bad experience with this artist , but i have had many of the good experience . i am not sure if the album is good or not , but it is an excellent album . my favorite song on this album is i am the one .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .

1	i am a huge fan of tom scott music . this is my favorite tom scott album . every song wa brilliant . i can not think of a single bad song . i love the sound of the guitar , the drum , and the bass . i really enjoyed the album and i am very happy with it . the album wa a little short , but that is not a big deal . i am very happy with this purchase .
0	i have to say that this song actually doe not sound like anything , but ha been used in a lot of movie and show and it ha gotten a lot of bad review . so , i will give it a 5 from me .
1	i bought this cd because i wanted to know more about the other side of the beatles and i have to say . this is a good album . i could not put it down and it wa worth every penny . it is very good . i can not imagine , listening to this for the first time , how many beatles album i will have on my shelf .
1	great lyric and great music . lareine is one of my favorite band ever .
0	i first heard this song on the radio when they played it during the christmas special . i wa so excited to hear this song when i found the album . when i first heard this song , i could not believe that it wa on the album . this song is so fun to listen to and when i dance to it , i feel like i am on top of the world ! it make me want to dance and sing along . i hope you all like this song a well .

0	i have this tape on a lot of tape that i listen to , and i still can not believe that i have to write about this tape to have it reviewed . i had to listen to what i had , the same a with all my other tape . i can not express to you how much i despise this tape .
0	i like the song on this album . it is a nice mix of song and good vocal too . i found this album to be more of a relaxing album . i would listen to it in the background while i am surfing the web or just looking at picture on facebook .
0	i have heard this cd once before and it sounded great . it is kind of boring , but i am listening to it this time . i would give it an 8.5 based on the review . i am going to pas on this cd .

0	i wa not a fan of his music until i got into a car accident in september 2003. i wa so angry and depressed , i bought all of oheards album and downloaded the entire cd-rom from the hospital . i had some of these cd in my car throughout the entire time i wa in the hospital . i then went to the hospital and watched the cd in the nurse station ( a nurse wa playing them to a group of u there ) and realized how much i loved them . i never thought i would be so happy to own a cd of my favorite singer . i also went back to the hospital after the accident and listened to saint and i wan na be your dog in the hospital room . i wa so happy to hear these cd and feel better . i have all of his album , from the first cd to the newest , and i still have all of his cd in my car .
1	this cd contains a lot of worship song . i liked the album a lot , but i think it is an overpriced album . i am not sure why , but i enjoyed the song .
0	i like the video . i think that the video wa really good . it is a great song . it wa a little bit repetitive at time .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	i am not a big beatles fan , but i have been listening to the album quite a bit . it is really nice to hear a new beatles album . i like this album , and i have listened to it at least 10 time so far . it is really good .
0	when i first heard this singer singing i wa really excited . i thought this singer wa going to be a great , great singer . i started listening to her first album and i thought it sounded really good . it wa a very good start , but by the time i listened to her second album i thought i would never see her again . i did not like this album at all . her voice is still very good , her music is still very good but this album doe not live up to the level of her previous album . this is one of the worst album of all time , ever .
0	great album . i love barbra streisand . she ha so much talent and is one of the most talented woman i have ever seen . so much of her life ha been devoted to music and performing that the fact that she is a woman alone should not be an issue when it come to her career . the lyric are good and she sings them better than many men . the music is excellent , too . i have listened to this album all the way through and it is still good . it is just a shame that nobody seems to really know about her . this album wa a waste of money .

0	i don ; t like this song .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	it is good
0	awol is a fun song .

1	i really liked the cd , i had never heard the pistol annie song before , and the song that make me smile is i am on your mind
1	loved this song . a great guitar riff , but the vocal are pretty off . i give it a 3 star .
1	a long a you do not listen to the opening track , you will be fine . this is a very good album that is just a little on the short side . there were six track that were over ten minute . the first is a good opener and the rest are great . i did like the whole album .
0	this is a great song . i do not understand why miley is getting so much hate . it ha a beautiful melody and wa written by a talented composer .
1	this song and the video are awesome .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this is not a bad cover at all . it seems to be a good representation of the band sound . the lyric make it a little more interesting , but probably not worth the price . the song is pretty cool . if you like punk rock , it would be worth a listen .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i love old country . i love the oldie . i love the country music . i love it all !
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music

0	a great song and very good album . bill
1	i have heard this song on the radio many time . i have been buying this cd ever since . i loved the song , but i wa disappointed with the video . i thought the video wa too cartoony . it wa hard to watch . i would like it to be more sophisticated and le cartoony .
0	the theme song for the show wa wonderful , but it did not fit in with the rest of the show . it took away from the feel of the show , and it wa an odd choice for a theme song .
1	i like that miley cyrus sings this song . i like that it doe not have a lot of word in it like many of the other song on this album .
0	love this album

1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i am a music lover , not a music reviewer . i listen to a lot of music , find it interesting , maybe even a little inspiring . i have a long standing love affair with the eagle and tom petty , and have bought their album . but i have never bought any music by roxy music , david bowie , james brown , or any of the other artist i like . so , now that i have put my toe in the water , i want to share with you all a little of the music i have been listening to lately . maybe you will find something that will become a new favorite , and maybe you will not . either way , thanks .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .

1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i think it is a powerful song . i do not think it is a very good song .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i love the song i will be home from the movie fury very much !
0	i love this album . i can not listen to it at all , it sound like a computer . i wish she would be back with her boyfriend . i love her voice , i love her . very upset about this album , and it is not even her best album . i can not wait to listen to her new album . i love her voice , i love her .

1	this is another album that is excellent .

0	this is an excellent cd .
1	this cd is beautiful . it a very deep sound . it also ha a nice background of sound .
0	i do not understand the hate this album get . i really like it . the band is very good . the recording is horrible . the best song are from the first two or three . the rest of the album is dull .

1	i found it on the internet and have to say that this song is one of my favorite .
1	this is a good album . i like the fact that the lyric are about love and not about sex . i also like the fact that the song do not have a lot of drum or percussion . the guitar in till the end is also nice .
0	this album did not do me any good . all over the place . i really , really wish that she would stop singing the same .
1	this is a fabulous christmas album . i have never heard anything like it . it ha all the hit from the 50 and 60 , but with a modern twist .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i love this song . i do not think i have ever been so excited to see a movie . i have grown up with tom wait and i always liked his music . if i could have a tom wait cd i would buy it from now on .

0	this is a very interesting album . i have not listened to it enough , but the song seem to be very personal . hasselvander make some good point a well . i have not listened to this album enough to make a good assessment of it . i did however have a friend , who is very much into the big band music , and she told me that this album is not for her .

1	this is one of the best r.kelly album . of course , the song on this album are all great . i have seen the single for this album and i love them too .
1	i like this album . i really like the song a lot better live than on the album . i am not sure why , but i think the album is a bit more polished and better sounding live . but it is still a little bit too poppy for me though . my only problem with the album is the vocal ; they are not bad , but i guess that is the way you have to make them sound to you . they are not that bad , but they are not a good a the other song .
0	very nice cd .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	a- this is a very well written song . it is a little different than what wanya is best known for , but i still think it is better than black and gold . this is a great example of wanyas style , and should get a lot of play .

1	i have heard this song before , but i never knew what a great song this is .
1	i agree with the rating of this song , but i have to agree with others that think this is better than i believe . this is a very powerful song that should be listened to on a daily basis . this is a great song to use in worship .
1	this is one of the most unique album to come out in a long time . the vocal are great , the band is very high energy and the music is a little out of this world .
0	the singer are bad . they sound like they are from a radio show . i do not care for music .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i love this album .
0	it is a good song , but i think it is a little old .
1	i love the cd . i love the lyric . this cd is amazing and wonderful .
1	this song make you feel better about yourself .
0	i have only heard this cd a few time . this is not good . to me this is the worst cd she ha ever made- except for the first cd , which is pretty good . this cd sound to me like a made for tv movie . the only good song on this cd are panty and break me
1	my favorite song of his is i believe which is a powerful song for his message .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	my husband bought this for me for christmas . i wa happy to receive this song .
1	i am not trying to win any award here , i am trying to be honest , because i like this music .
1	i really like this album . i love the music , and the lyric are very easy to understand . i give it 5 star because it is a good album . i would definitely recommend this a a first date . i
0	this is the best song on this album . the music is excellent , the lyric are not , but i guess thats a matter of personal taste . the song is a good one and the music is excellent . the only negative thing about this song is the vocalist , he can sound kinda high pitched sometimes .
0	this album is so bad that you can not believe anyone would consider buying this album . i agree with the review . it is very hard to believe it could be worth one time . i have yet to find a song that i like other than the lead singer . he doe not sing very well either .
0	i bought this cd expecting the same quality of the others , but it wasnt . i wa not disappointed . i listen to the cd everyday .
0	i wa very happy with the cd . it wa a good deal . it wa not perfect . it is a good deal . it is worth the money . i would recommend this cd to anyone . it is a good deal and a good price and i would recommend it to anybody . i would recommend it to anyone who like jazz .
0	i just want to rip this cd to my ipod and listen to it all the time
0	i have a few prince cd in my collection , but i think this is the best one , and i have heard a lot of the other one , too . it ha a lot of great tune .
0	the album sound pretty good , but she really need to stop singing those same old song that she ha been singing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and every time .
0	i think this is a terrible song . it doe sound like it would be a hit if it wa sung by anyone other than tom wait . the instrumentation is so bizarre that it make it difficult to figure out what song it could be . it sound like the member of this project are either performing for themselves , or for the other member of their band . the song doe sound like it would be fun to listen to , but it just make you think that maybe this band wa a mistake .
0	if you can find this song on youtube just remember that the only thing more annoying than a song being played on the radio ( because the song is already on the radio ) is the person who play it on the radio , being the only person who is listening to it that day .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	i can only tell you that i did not enjoy this album at all . it is very melodic and tour de force but it lack the originality of other album in the genre . i can only tell you that i did not enjoy the album at all . i am not saying that it can not be listened to , but it is just not my cup of tea .
0	i love the grateful dead . i am a huge fan . i have listened to most of their album . the only thing i do not like about this cd is the shipping cost .
0	i just found out about this album . i had already listened to the first album . i really do not like tom wait , but i like this album . i do not know why this album is not more popular . i like the song , but i do not know why they are not in more popular album .
0	i do not understand why this song is so popular . i do not think there is much to it . it is not my type of song .
0	i like the cd , and i like the lyric , but i hate the song .
1	i never liked this album , but when i heard this song i fell in love with it again . this song is my favorite song from the album . it make you feel so happy in the morning when you are listening to it and i will always listen to this song .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i liked this song . hasselvander wrote the song .
0	i love the beatles , this is a fun album .
1	i love this song . it is my favorite song of the 21st century and i have listened to it constantly since i wa a kid . it is my favorite song of all time .
0	i like this album . it is great ! i like it a lot . you should listen to it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i have heard people say that this album is not great because it is just filler song and not really an album . but to me it is amazing . i really like the song , the songwriting , and the album is overall great .
0	i love the song do not stop believing i love the band , and i am always buying their album .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i have heard this on cd before , but now i have the cd in my hand . when i first heard it , i wa blown away . i have not listened to anything like this since . this is a song of pure beauty . it is in a beautiful harmony and ha exquisite lyric . the music is of the highest quality . i would have to say it is a karajan masterpiece .
0	this song ha some great part and good part . i like most of the song on this cd . but this song is the only one that i really like .
1	i really like this cd . there is a great selection of different type of song . i will be giving it to my son a a gift . i am very happy with this cd .
1	i am currently in the middle of a song called aint no stoppin by the temptation . i think it is a great song . it is an old song but it sound good and i like the lyric . i do not really like the song itself , but i do like the music .
1	my son ha been listening to this in the car for about a year now . it nice to have a way to read to your child when you are in a rush .
0	this is the most amazing cover .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i am so glad that this album is out of print . the band is a lost classic .
0	i love this cd . this song is just a good a the music from the movie . i saw the movie this weekend and have been listening to the soundtrack . i love the movie so i had to buy the soundtrack . the music is incredible . but i will not buy another cd from amazon .
0	i received the cd in a good case . the cd wa in a good case , but the case wa cracked . i will be returning this cd in a good case . the cd is clear and in a good case . i would recommend anyone to get the cd in a case and not crack it .
0	i have tried about six different cd to get this on my ipod . i have tried about four different cd player and none of them can get this cd to play on my ipod . it is also very hard to find . this is a waste of time and money .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i fell in love with the song and the vocalist wa very nice and i think she can sing like a angel .
1	steve morse wa a great musician and a great man . this album is outstanding . steve wa one of the best . this is the definitive version of his music . the record is excellent in every way , from sound to detail and feel . if you like late 70s/80s steve morse , this is the album for you .
1	the music is excellent , especially the first few song . the lyric are quite good , and very good for the time . it is a good collection of song .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	this is one of my favorite and most popular tape . i would recommend this tape to any person who like jazz , not so much for jazz .

1	this is one of the best song from the band ! my brother and i got this for christmas . we have been listening to it at night at bedtime .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
0	i am a big fan of this singer , but this album , a far a i can tell , is about the singer herself . i love that she sings with passion and emotion but she doe not seem to be that great of a singer . the lyric seem a little dated , but there are a few good one on here . the overall feel of the album is the same , a little more country with a touch of rock and roll . i am not sure what else to say . it is a very good album , a good start , but not so great . i would say that it is better than the singer previous album . the first album wa way too poppy and the second album wa way too rock and roll . this album is better , but i am not the most impressed .
1	the piano is a bit too loud but the vocal are nice
1	this is a great song to play when you want to listen to the other side of the story . i play it when i am going out to a party or just want a little pick me up . sometimes i listen to it when i am driving and just want to drive . it is a great song that is great for people who like to sing along . the song is a great representation of the gospel . it is a great song to sing with your friend at your family gathering . the lyric are very powerful .

0	a lot of people have probably heard this song , but they have not been introduced to the song . it is actually a song that is a good song , but it is one that a lot of people would probably not have heard . i do not think it is been produced more than a few time but it is a good song and not a bad song . i like it and it is a good song . it is a good song that a lot of people have never heard . if you liked it , you probably would not have heard it . i do not like this song and it is not a good song or a good message . i like the message , however , but i do not like the song . i liked the message it had but i do not like the song . i like the song , but i do not like the message . i like the song , but i do not like the message this song ha . this song is a good song that a lot of people have not heard . if you like it , you probably would not have heard of it . i do not like this song and it is not a very good song or a very good message . i like the message it had , but i do not like the song . i like the song , however , i do not like the message this song ha . this song is great , but it is not a very good song or a very good message . it is a very good song and it is a very good message . this song is great , but it is not very good . it is a very good song , but it is not a very good song . this song is a very good song , but it is not very good . this song is a very good song , but it is not a very good song .

0	this is a very good trance album , if you like trance , go buy this !
0	i donít like this song at all . it is boring .
1	this is one of the best beatles song in a while . i think this is one of the best beatles song of all time . the song is well-written ; the lyric are very strong and it is very catchy . i have been listening to this song since i wa five . this song make my toe curl .
0	i love this song , but the version i got is terrible . i would like to know why this is on the cd player in my car , & on my ipod , when i have no cd player ( or cd player at all ) , & how they picked this version . i can not believe they would put this version on an album with a cd player , when i have no cd player , & now have a cd player that doe not have a cd player .

0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing

1	i have listened to this song , and i have to admit , i have not listened to it enough to know what it is all about . but this song is amazing . i think i will listen to the rest of the album . it is one of the most amazing song i have heard in a very long time .
1	great album , i have listened to this song in the car and i wa amazed at the beautiful sound quality .
0	i wa disappointed in the music . it is really boring . the bass line is not that good . there is no melody . the sound quality is bad
0	i love mileys can not get you out of my head song . the lyric are extremely catchy and the video is very catchy . the only reason i do not like this song is because i think the singer is singing too high in the note .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i like this album to be honest . i am just disappointed that i have to pay for a cd that i really enjoy .
1	when it came to the album , she basically wrote what she wanted to write for the album , which is what people who are into the whitney style of singing should be listening to ( i did not like the song love me , but that is probably a personal preference ) . the album is well-produced , and the song sound good . i do not know if that is a good thing or not , but it is all i can do to get a positive review .
0	i bought this album because it wa on sale . i thought it would be worth it . it wasnt .
0	i have been a jewel fan since 1983. i have been listening to her a lot more recently . i love her voice and her music , i wish she would do another album . i hope they will release what wa recorded on her first album . when i first heard fool gold i fell in love , i wa so excited to hear her voice again . it wa a great album . i loved the a hard love video . it wa so funny .

1	a truly great song .
1	this album wa released in 1989 , and it seems to be a great example of what a record company could do with a new band . i like the song , and would like to hear more from them . i also do not think this is a great classic rock album , but it is not awful either . i do like the cover .
1	great song to sing to .
0	i like it but i do not think it is a really great song .
1	i love hammond and this album so much ! it is super high quality , and is a dream to listen to .
0	i have been listening to jvj for about ten day now . i like the new album and i am thinking of buying the old album . i have not listened to the new one yet but i plan to soon . i like the sound of the new album better . i just do not like the way the lead singer sound now . i do not have anything against jvj but i just do not like this new singer . i do not know if i like this band or not . i am not really a fan . he seems to be playing his music too fast . i do not listen to that kind of music . i like the way the old singer sound . my cd player is playing better music now .
1	the first song wa good but still the same . the second one is better .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i bought this book from amazon . it arrived today . the cover is beautiful , but the cover art is really terrible . the music is not good , but it is not bad . it is the type of music that i would expect to hear in an oldie rock station .
0	it is a great album . i love the song my way , and the rest of the album is great . i love the song someday , the song is so simple but it is so catchy and reminds me of my girlfriend and her friend .
0	when i first heard this song i thought he sounded like the black eyed pea i thought he sounded like a rapper , and i am glad i wa wrong , he is a very good singer and his voice is different from any rap singer . i think this song fit well for a wedding and is an inspirational song for anyone who want to make their life more meaningful . i would definitely download this song for my wedding .
1	this song is a great hymn to sing when you need to put on a smile . it ha been a favorite of mine since i wa a child .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	i love this album ! i love this album !

1	this wa a big hit in the 80 , so it can not be that bad . it is very slow , but it is not slow a molasses by any mean . i like the backing singer and the piano . i also like the drum , but the electric guitar is very weak and the vocal are very bad . i did like the bass , but the bassist is a very poor bass player . the guitar player ha a strong voice , and i like the way he play . but the piano player ha a very weak voice . they also did a cover of ( i have had ) the time of my life .

0	it is my favorite album from that year and my favorite from the 90 .
0	lyric are great , but the vocal are not . the vocal are good , but the lyric just do not stand out . they are not bad , but the lyric do not match the melody or flow of the song . also , there are too many word . there are over 100 word in the song . it is like he wrote every word on the page and then cut and pasted it into the lyric . it is not a bad song , but it could have been written better . and i do not think it wa . i think he just did not know how to write song . he is a great lyricist , but he is got to get some of those great word , and some of those great melody . it is just that he doe not have the song .
1	i love mileys voice . i have been listening to it for a long time now and it is one of my favorite . this is a great song . i have been listening to it for a long time now and it ha been on repeat for awhile . this is a great song .
1	this is just a really good country song . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true fan of country music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always searching for a song that brings him closer to god . this is a great song to listen to when you want to be closer to god .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i like the song . i love that she said i got my life back at the end of the song . i do think she is trying to be a good person and is trying to stay on the straight and narrow . i think she is a drug addict .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i do not know what to say about this album . it sound like a compilation of the same old song that madonna
1	this is a very good cd . it ha great band at a very good price . i am a grateful dead fan for year and year , but it wa time to upgrade to something new . this is it . i bought this album and put it on while i wa on vacation . i wa very impressed with the quality . i would buy it again in a heartbeat . i bought it when i found it in my dad collection , but he bought it a few day ago , when i wa away for a long time . when i got back i looked at it and thought hmm i wonder if it will still be there ? a few minute later it wa on my doorstep . needle to say , it wa one of my new faves . i love this cd . i have a feeling the album will be my new best of for a long time to come ! i have no idea what the cd is called but i am pretty sure it will be on a list of best of 2009 for sure . i guess this is a good time for me to say thanks to the creator of this cd . thanks for being so amazing !
1	i like all their music . i would like to hear more of it .
0	wow ! i am not sure how i feel about this song . i guess i am glad i have this album because it ha some of my favorite song from the whole album . it is pretty simple . it is the only song on the album that i like on a personal level and this song is a perfect example . it is a love song but it is not the typical love song . i do not know what it wa , but this song just did not have it .
0	i wa surprised at how good this one wa . i wa hoping that the song would be more like the rest of her repertoire . it is so different from what i have heard , and i have to say , i really like it . it is just one of those song that you can not put down .
1	i am very much looking forward to this cd . it is a wonderful collection of song , from the 20th century . a beautiful and unusual collection . each song is a gem , and a treasure .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this is the first time i have heard this set of music that i really enjoyed . the music is very well played and there is no doubt that the quality of the recording is very good for this era . i really like this set of music . it wa my first impression of the music i have heard on this album and for that i have to make a special note of it . it is just a very enjoyable listening experience .

1	if you want a great dave clark five album , you have to buy this one . you will love them .
1	i wish i could listen to this album again and again . the song is really good . the lyric are about loving god and being thankful for him . it wa nice to hear the song sung by barbra , instead of just spoken by her . the sound quality is really good . i think it is a very good album . it ha great music and great lyric .
0	i hear this song all the time . i like it .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i like this song . it is good . it is a decent song .
0	this guy , who know , i will probably forget about him . he wa one of my favorite band , and i have literally read every song on every album he ever released , but this ? i listened to it once , and that wa it . did he really write these ? i mean these lyric ? i remember a lot of them . my favorite wa i would rather be a tree than a stone . i liked a lot of the song , but i do not think i will ever listen to this again .
0	i am not sure whether this is a real song , but it is a very pretty one . i like it a lot when it is played through the stereo speaker . it can be used to relax the mind and body . it is very soothing . i do not understand why it is been put out so many time , but i still like it . i like this cd .
0	i will not forget this album . it is a must have for any metal fan . and it is the best album of the 90 .

1	i love this song .
1	i love everything about this album , but some of the song are just plain boring to me . the song when love first is a great song , but there is no real life message . i like how the song is about giving love to someone , but it just doe not grab me at all . i am an older gay man and i am really looking forward to listening to this album again .
1	one of the most beautiful song ever recorded !
1	this album is a collection of the top 5 song from the soundtrack of the movie jurassic park by steven spielberg . all the song are great and the only one that i do not like is bone because of the loud trumpet . however , if you are a fan of the movie and the music and you only want the top 5 song , this is the way to go !
1	i hear this song a lot , and i enjoy it . but i would like to add that it is not very good . the sound is somewhat muffled . and the lyric are rather simplistic . the vocal are high pitched and not very energetic . it is almost like the singer are taking the song seriously but not really singing . it is a good song , but not a great one .
0	this is a great album . the cover art is fantastic , and the music is beautiful . unfortunately , the cd doe not play . please do not purchase this cd . i will refund you money .
1	this wa one of the first album i bought ( in the late 80 ) . it wa one of the first song i played on guitar . i can not believe the last time i played this song wa when i wa 13 and i wa listening to a cassette copy of it . it is so very cool . i wish there wa a better recording . i still listen to this song quite often . i think it is a must have for any guitar fan .
0	this album ha a great sound . great lyric . love the beatles .
0	i bought this cd a a gift for a friend who love to sing and play piano . i will admit i like the cd , but i am not sure if i will ever buy another one . the song selection is limited ; and the album is over 2 hour . it is very poor quality . the sound quality of the recording is very poor , and the quality of the cd itself is very poor . it is very disappointing to spend this much money on a recording that will not be played in a very long time . you are wasting your money on this product . the music will play great , but there is not much of it .
1	this is a great song . i really like it . i think it is one of the best of the year .
0	i purchased this album because i wa looking for something different . i am really enjoying it . it is a great album . i love the sound of the song . i am glad i bought it . i wish i had purchased the other album instead . i have no idea when i will get to listen to it all .
1	i am not a believer in the supernatural , but i really enjoyed this album . it wa a nice change from the normal pop gospel .
1	i have never been a big fan of this kind of music , but this is a good album . the song are decent . the album itself is okay , but it is nothing special .
1	i have been listening to this cd since i found it . i am glad i did .
1	i am a big fan of dave clark five , especially in his early-70s heyday . i like the music , the lyric , and especially the organ playing . i really have to give this album 5 star . it is one of the best recording that i have ever heard . i listen to it a lot .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	if you are not a fan of a live show or have not seen a live show in a long time , this cd is a must have . i have been searching for day for a good live concert cd , and found only one of these . it is definitely a good album , but i am not a fan of live concert . i hope that i can find a version of this cd that ha a band doing a live show , but i doubt it , a this is more of a concert cd than anything else . for example , there is no sound of the band tuning the guitar , or playing the solo , or anything . it is just a concert cd .
0	this is a really good album to listen to . i think the best part of this album is the song mama boy . i like the song i am so glad i can not be your boy . it is a great song .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	this wa a good compilation , but i do not think i will ever purchase more than a couple of these . a an example , the second track on the second disc is a collection of three different take of the beatles good day sunshine ( which is a great song ) .
1	i love this song very much .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	there is a lot of music that can help you relax , but this cd is my own favorite .
1	a friend of mine bought this album after me . i did not know that this album wa so good .
0	this is a great song . the video is funny .
1	i am in love with this album
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	no , he never did any more commercial work after this . the album is a collection of some of his best song , and he did not make any more album a far a i know .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i bought this album on-line to listen to it on my iphone during the afternoon nap . i think it is a very nice album . i would recommend it . it ha some nice song .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want give him lesson .
0	this is a good album that ha a good selection of trance track . the track are very repetitive at time , but it is still a good album to listen to and get a good workout out of .
1	this cd is a little disappointing . it ha some really good song , and some really bad song . it ha a very predictable mix . i am not sure how good it is , but i do like a little variety .
0	excellent recording of this well-known piece . the playing is a good a it get in my opinion .
0	i started by listening to this cd , and then later on i bought it . i would recommend this cd to someone who is looking for a good collection of song .
0	i bought this cd for my mother in law for her birthday . she loved it . it is a great cd . the song are not bad . the cd is not bad . the music is wonderful . it is not a waste of money . she did not have too much trouble remembering the song . the main reason for buying this cd is that i know she would like to hear it again . she loved it . i know i would like to hear it again so that i could have it in my collection .
0	this suck ! this is the worst song from r.kelly .
1	i had never heard of this artist before i came across his cd , and i wa hooked . i had to put on i love you and do not cry no tear to really appreciate this man talent .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i am a big fan of jazz and so this album is right up my alley ! i really like the different style jazz ha come to be and i love the feeling of the music . i look forward to more album by this artist .
1	i really like this cd . the music is really good . it is like listening to the movie .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	this album should be great for the devot prince collector i , m , so glad i own it . the track are very princé just jamming and having a good time with the beat . if you looking for more commercial prince stuff this is never it though you would not have found yourselves here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i love to listen to hammond . this is a great album .
1	this song ha been around for quite a while , but this is the first time i have ever heard it .
0	for those of you who do not know me , i love this song . i think it is a great trance song with a lot of good lyric .
1	this album is absolutely wonderful . i can not listen to it for a long time without getting goose bump . the song were very well crafted , the vocal were clear and well-spoken , and the production wa top-notch , but it just did not quite do it for me . the album ha a great balance of song that are both upbeat and very relaxing at the same time , with the occasional down-tempo song thrown in . the only song i did not care for wa doubt , but i did not listen to it long enough to hate it . overall , this is a very highly recommended album .
0	a really great album , if you are a fan of jewel . the singing is good , but the song themselves are not . jewel wa doing the song , but she did not sing it the way it should be sung .
1	one of the best . it is the only one i have heard with the original recording .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	i am not sure i agree with all the review i have read about the new album .
0	i am hoping to get another copy of this cd . it is a waste of my time .
1	i did not know i needed to have this on my list . i did not know i needed to have one of these on my list . i did not know i needed to have a dave clark five record . i do not ever listen to dave clark five anymore . i love this cd so much that i am going to buy another one of their cd .
0	i really love this song .
0	[ i do not like ] this song , and i do not like this album . also , i think that is the reason why i enjoy this song so much . i really do not like it . i like this album , but i do not like this song .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this is one of my favorite . i have heard it several time .
1	this is one of the best song ever ! he is one of the best male artist out there . i love this song ! it very sexy ! i can not wait to hear more from r.kelly . please keep him in your music . please make more song by him ! please make more song by r.kelly !
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this song give me hope . i feel like it really is possible to live a happy and healthy life . i am not afraid to die .
1	i have had my lg g2 for about a month now and i am very impressed with it . the battery last all day and the screen is very bright , so i can do most thing on it outside of direct sunlight . i can not say that about iphone or anything else . i have not had my htc incredible . i love my g2 . i love how the screen is backlit and the key are backlit . i love how the key have a nice click to them . i love that the screen is backlit and not just a very dark screen . i love the keyboard , and the voice command in both direction work very well . the speaker is loud and clear , and it ha a clear microphone and a good microphone . the button are large and i love the battery life . the phone is very light and easy to hold and it feel very solid .
0	i would definitely reccomend this album to my friend .
0	if you really like to listen to lordes music , listen to this . if you do not like it , do not listen to it .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this song make me listen to my wife when i am not with her . i know she love it , but i can not hear it on the radio without hearing it live . i love this song , and i love my wife . she is the most special person in my life . i can not explain why i love her so much . my wife is my whole world to me . i can not imagine my life without her . i love you so much .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	this is an awesome music ! the lyric are so good . the music is not so good , but the vocal are great ! the song is awesome !
0	really cool .
0	i really liked this cd . i thought her voice wa awesome .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	this album ha very few song i do not like . i do not see why i would buy it , but i will .
1	this is a music cd . all i can say is that it is very good . i love the music . this is a music cd .
1	i love ya
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	this is an excellent cd . it is a great choice for someone who ha trouble sleeping . it is a relaxing cd that is sure to put you to sleep . i have purchased several of her other cd and have enjoyed them all . if you are looking for a soothing cd that will help you fall asleep , this is a great choice .
1	i really liked this song !
1	the beatles were the most influential band in the world . they influenced thousand of musician , including myself , and they influenced me . they also influenced the way i think . this is the best collection of song i have ever heard .
0	well this album is not bad . i think the song are good and have great lyric . but it is not good a a whole , it is not a good album
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i like the chorus .
1	i am a classical music fan . however , it is difficult to find music by the great composer that i enjoy . what is the remedy ? i am trying to find some music and i can not find what i am looking for . the internet is full of music i can not find ! i have become a music consumer and enjoy listening to all kind of music i can not get for free . so what is the remedy ? i guess that is the question . this album is not like the others i have tried . the music is of a higher quality and if you like classical music , this is a must have . it is not to be missed .
0	it is a good cover . i like the song and the movie version is better .
1	i just bought the the chicago symphony orchestra - boston symphony orchestra cd . i love this recording . it is wonderful . i have heard the chicago symphony orchestra , but never this quality . i like it a lot .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	i just downloaded the song . it wa a good song
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i have listened to this cd repeatedly . the song are okay , but the production is really bad . it is hard to understand what you are supposed to be listening to . i am giving this cd to my friend though . i do not think i will ever listen to it again .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a few day now and i have really enjoyed it . the music is soothing , but at the same time it is energetic .
1	this is very different from the movie . i do not know what the name is , but it is still a great song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	this is the best cd player i have ever owned . it really is the best money could buy . the sound is amazing . i would purchase it again . it wa a great gift for my father-in-law , and he is very pleased with it . he ha been listening to music on his new ipod for a good long time , and this is the perfect player to use with it . if you want a true cd player , you can not do better than this . now , i have to buy another one . thanks , composer .
1	i liked the song , but i thought it wa rather slow . i have not heard it in awhile so i will give it another chance .
0	i love lorde , and i wa really excited about this album . i love the album .
0	i am a fan of the broadway show that mr. ponder ha done . my favorite is annie and it is just a good a his other show . however , this cd is an example of how poorly written and produced a broadway show can be . this cd is not the worst broadway show i have ever heard , but it is not the best either . it is not even close . this show is a complete and total rip-off of the original broadway show and should never have been released . it is an insult to fan of annie who have been waiting for a new version of this great musical .
0	i am so glad i bought this record , there are a few track that i like , but overall the album is just the best i have ever heard . i do not think that there is a bad track on it .
1	i am a huge fan of this song and have bought it many time . the chorus is so simple for a duet that i love . however , my favorite part is the last verse . i have found that if i repeat the chorus , the verse get even better , so i sing it a lot .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i like love story the best . the album is solid . i like the song better than candy girl . the arrangement are better than the previous album . i think this album is better than the previous one . this album is a step up from the previous one , and i like it more . i think the last album wa more of a step down . i think this
0	it is a classic country song and one i have heard a lot . i think it is one of the best . i think it is an honor just to be mentioned in the song . i think it is an honor to be mentioned in a song .
0	i absolutely love this album . i have been listening to it all the time since it came out and the lyric are so powerful .
1	the song is a little different from the other hit by brandy . it is a little more mature . i like it .
0	this one wa really bad .
0	i can not believe i have read this book twice . i wa hooked the first time i read it . it wa soooo good ! it just kept me reading . i have read the second book , and am looking forward to reading the third !
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had gotten it sooner . this album is great but i do not know if it is the masterpiece . it is a great album , but it is not my favorite album .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i had always heard this song and wa fascinated by it beat , but i never knew what it meant or why it wa so special . i am going to buy this cd and listen to it over and over again .
0	just a random review of the first 100 song i see on amazon . i will be honest , this song is not all that great . it is catchy , but it is just not very good . i am surprised i even bothered rating it .
1	i have been a fan of bonnie raitt since her first album a lady like me wa released . since then i have been wanting to hear everything that she ha ever done . this is it . i love it !
0	it a very nice song , but i am afraid i will not buy the album .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this cd wa a gift for my wife for mother day . i do not think i will ever find anything i like better than jewel . she is a great singer , guitarist , and songwriter .
1	i wa never a big fan of dave clark five . that is , until i wa offered a chance to purchase the cd they recorded in 1996. this is one of the best cd i have ever heard and i am proud to own one of the best . i have been a fan of the dave clark five since i wa a teenager , and this cd is one of the best that i have ever heard . i am a big fan of david crosby , and i like his music , but i wa never a big fan of them . i will admit that i felt a little sad when i heard that they had decided to call it a day ( and retire ) after this album . i guess my only explanation is that i had been waiting for this cd to come out for a very long time . i wa very disappointed when i heard that this wa their last cd . i guess that is why i wa disappointed , because i wa hoping that they would continue to tour and record more music . i guess that will never happen now . i mean , i guess i could be happy for them , but i am not . i guess i will just have to move on . this is a very good cd from a great band , and one that i feel is worthy of more than a few year of life on my record player .
1	i bought this album based on the cd . it is amazing . it wa nice to hear e. s. posthumus again .
0	i have listened to this album twice , and i just do not like it . i am sure it is fantastic . but it is not my cup of tea . it is just not . it is too bland even for me . i am a fan of the music , and i love the album , but this just wasnt my kind of thing . i am not gon na give it 5 star , because i know i am not the only one . i would love to hear more of his stuff though , because i am a huge fan , and i am not sure that i can tell the difference between his playing and what he ha on this album . it is just not my cup of tea . i guess i just can not stand his playing .
1	i am a big fan of this band and i have listened to most of their music .
1	i love this song and the video is very entertaining and well-produced .
1	i would have to say this one is my least favorite . ohearns voice is a little bland , his voice is a little flat , and his music is nothing special . the only thing i like about this song is that it is unique .
1	this is a great christmas cd . i bought it a a gift for my husband for christmas . it is a perfect song for the season . i like that it is not too over the top , and the lyric are very clear . it is a great album to play on the way to the store after thanksgiving dinner for your family .
0	this cd is very good .
0	i am not a huge fan of the early 90 r & b album but this is one of the best so far . the song lyric are the best part of the album and i am glad that i like the song . i would say that this is one of the best on the new year and is my most fav r & b album of the new year .
0	i like it a lot . it is not bad . it is just a bad song .
1	i have this cd and it is great ! i love the fact that it is on cd !
1	this song rock ! lorde is one of my favorite artist . i like this song . i hope the album is better .
1	her voice reminds me of judy garland . she is very unique . she ha a great soul .
1	this is the best musical experience i have ever had in the house cd - this one . it is very easy to listen to . there is a little bit of a grating in the sound but it doe not bother me . this is the only recording i have ever heard of the karajan-strauss marriage .
1	this is a nice compilation of the work of some of the most famous opera singer of the past century . it is a nice collection of short , interesting selection that are easy to listen to on a long drive . the only problem that i found with the set are that the sound quality is not very good at time and at other time you can hear background sound .
1	good album , with a few dud , but the song are enjoyable .
1	i really like the album and i am glad you put out another album .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i am so happy that this album ha been released on cd . i would like to see more song like this one .
1	this is really funny and really good .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this album wa one of the first album i ever bought . i think it is a wonderful piece of work . i wish it had more song .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	i am not a fan of song such a jesus is all i need , jesus is all i need and god is real by joni mitchell were very good . but this is my life by r. kelly is a real winner .
0	i am not a big fan of this song , but i like it because of it lyric . i like the way billie joe armstrong delivers them .
1	i love all the worship artist i listen to . this album is great . i like the style of the music and the message . i will be buying the cd for myself a well a my husband and son . i like the style of music in worship .
1	can i buy this cd a a gift for my boyfriend ? i like this song , but i am not sure i want to buy
0	this album rock . the song are well performed , and the production is top-notch .
0	i would like to say that i like his music , but unfortunately i am not so sure . i have heard them , and i have listened to most of his song but i do not like his singing voice . i listened to this song and thought it wa great , but i would like to know if anyone else can say that they like this song .
0	i don t like this cd , but it is a good cd .
1	i love the music on this cd ! i wa looking for a country cd to buy , and i found this . i love it , i wish i had found it sooner !
0	i am not a fan of this album . i think that people are just drawn to the music of prince , but i just do not think this album is good .
1	i think this is his best song . from the first time i heard it i thought that wa it , but i have listened to it several time since and i definitely think it is a great song . i am glad i finally got a copy of this album , because i would have lost it before i got it . this song is a great example of a powerful theme .
1	this is a very positive song . great message . i love it .
0	i have enjoyed listening to the jazz and classical jazz recording of john coltrane and his contemporary . it wa also good to hear the music of frank sinatra , george gershwin , bill evans , and charlie parker . to be honest , i wa hoping for some of the older recording of the great , but all i got wa an old version of the man with the golden arm . i wa hoping for a new cd from a very talented artist . i must say , i wa very disappointed in this cd . it wa a good effort , but the execution wa lacking .
1	i have been waiting all season to hear this album , and i wa very glad to hear it . there is nothing else i would rather hear in the world . i have been living with a couple of different dts-hd-ma1 and hd-ma2 surround sound system , but i have never found a more powerful stereo presentation than this , even though i have had the hd-ma2 . it is an excellent album that will be enjoyed for many year to come .
1	i like this album , but i could not find a song on it , so i bought this cd to see if there were any song i wa missing . i could not find a song on this cd , but i did find a song on another cd i had . i am not sure what i wa thinking buying this cd , but i did . i like it , and i do not understand why not many people like this album . i would suggest all people buy this cd if they like it .
1	i wish i had listened to this song while i wa in the bath , i would have been even more inspired and uplifted .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i like listening to this band
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this wa a great album , i like this a lot .
0	this guy is great i like his voice he ha a great voice and ha a band that is great also .
0	it is one of the most popular song . it is one that everyone know . it is also one that is often played on the radio . it is a very positive song . it is a lot of fun to listen to it .
0	i have been a fan of this musical genre since my first encounter with it around 1978. i had no idea how much i would love it . this album is not only a compilation of some of my favorite oldie , but also a collection of song that have been put together beautifully .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i like this very much . the vocal are pretty good . i would recommend this cd to anybody .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i have listened to this cd multiple time and i am a big fan . the only problem i have with the cd is that the vocal are so soft that at time it sound like the vocal are coming from another room .
1	i am glad that i found this album . it is different from the other r & b album that i have heard . the album is a great album . i will buy again !
0	well , they call it a classic rock album , but this album is more of a soft rock . that is why i give this album a 2 star rating . the singing is ok , but the singing wasnt what made me want to listen to this album . the music wa ok , but i did not love it . the band wa ok , but i did not love them . so it is a 2 star rating .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i would call this album an average album . it ha a little bit of everything ; love song , worship song , praise song , etc . i would say it is about average . i would say this album is a solid album , but not something i would call a classic . if you are looking for a christian album to listen to , i would say this is not the album for you . i would call this a solid album , but not truly a classic . if you are looking for a christian album to listen to listen to , i would say this is not the album for you , even though it is a solid album . i would say this is a solid album with a variety of song , but it is not a classic . i would say this is a solid album with a variety of style . it is not a classic . i would say this is a solid album , but not truly a classic .
0	love it . i guess the song is just a great today a when i last heard it on the radio in the early 80 .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	a great song . just the melody is just so beautiful . i love the way it change and add to the whole song . i am glad i downloaded it .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	this is a fun oldie song . it is a good one .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	this is such a great song . i am glad i do not live in a country that hate miley cyrus so much .
1	i don think that tom wait doe a good job on
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	i have the first jewel cd , some song are good . some song are not . but this is not good enough to warrant buying it . it is a live version of her first album when she wa a solo artist . it is a good effort , but it is not good enough to warrant buying . it is just another live cd by jewel .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i remember finding this cd on my brother-in-law shelf . i have no idea how he first heard it , but i am sure it wa in one of his first cd . when i bought it , it wa a one-off and i have not seen it since . the song my life is what struck me about it . i just could not get past it . i have always been a sucker for old-school , old-fashioned sounding pop music , and it is been a real struggle to get past the old song on this album . and it is not the weakest album in my collection , but it is not the best , either . i like some of the song and some of the lyric , but not all of them . and i am not sure why . i know the lyric are not great either , but i just can not get past them . i wa very lucky to get it .
1	i think this is one of the best dave clarkfive album .
1	i hope for a successful career for her .
1	i love this album . if your looking for a great album to listen to when you are feeling down or have an angry day , this is a great album . i would give this album 5 star .

1	this song made me laugh and it made me smile . it made me feel a little better . i believe this song is a great christmas song . i love it . i love it .
1	it is a beautiful melody . the song is full of emotion , but there is no back story . i do not know how anyone could even listen to this song and not be moved by it . it wa a gift from god and i am very grateful that god gave me this gift .

1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i love mileys video for all i wan na do , but it made me feel like i wa watching a porn film instead of a good pop video . also , the song is great , but i wish she would have gone heavier on the vocal . it did not feel like it wa her .
0	this cd ha some great song . i have many cd of similar music by the same artist , but this cd ha none of them .
1	i love this song ! i love it so much that i bought the album . i think i will be having to listen to it all the time .

1	i like this song but wish tom wait would get some new song out . he doe this live every day so it is no surprise that he ha a lot of song and he doe it well .
0	i love miley cyrus . this is one of her best album .
1	this is a beautiful music of karajans called the world is waiting for the sunrise .
1	this wa the best grateful dead cd i have ever heard . it is the best grateful dead cd , period . the only con is that it is very expensive and you are charged extra for shipping .
0	i love the song . the first song love song is my favorite .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	jp is a very gifted player and a great singer . there are a few track on this disc that are simply outstanding . i think he ha a great future ahead of him and i hope he continues to produce more quality material . i highly recommend this cd to all my friend and family .
1	this is a fantastic cd . it ha a great sound and the lyric are very good !
0	i liked the way we were but i do not think i would love this song .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this cd wa released today . i wa disappointed . it wa a good cd . i liked it ! i did not like the cd . very disappointing . sam sparro is a good singer , but not good enough to be on idol .
1	i purchased this cd and have been listening to it non-stop ever since . it is the only cd i have purchased in the last few month that i have really enjoyed . it is the first cd i have purchased that i did not feel guilty about buying .
0	i ordered this cd because i had a couple of old favorite , but i wa surprised by the quality . i really liked the song . i am disappointed that the cd wa too short . i would have liked to have it longer .
1	this is a great album . the lyric are very interesting . the cover is cool . the quality of the sound is great . i really like all that i am .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this is the best song of all time .
1	i have been a fan of the band for year . this collection is great . very good stuff
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this song is good , but the video is a little much .
0	i have to say , i am a little bit disappointed in this song . i wa really hoping for a lot more .
0	i am not a big fan of christmas song , but i have always enjoyed the classic christmas song on this cd . it is a great song , and i would recommend it to anyone who like christmas music .
0	i like this cd for the sound quality and the song are great . i like the song on this cd .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	i love listening to this song . i love the way miley sings it .
0	i love bonnie tyler music , but i have to say that i have never heard her sing in a more beautiful voice .
1	i like the song on this album . i like the song on this record . i like the song on this record . i like the song on the record . i especially like the song heaven door . i especially like the song heaven door .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i like the music , but the song are too long , or the song are so short i can not stand them
1	i am a dedicated barbra streisand fan . i am also a fan of the broadway album . i love barbra streisand . i am a sucker for a good singing voice .
1	my favorite song . great band , great sound , great video , great lyric .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i really like this song .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	most song were the same . she sings better by herself .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this album ha nothing to do with the album the secret history by the same name . the album cover say so and it on the album cover that say so .
1	all i know is that i am a single girl of twenty-five
0	i love most of the song on this cd .
1	i have enjoyed
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i am not sure why my sister got pregnant , i think it wa a result of beautiful life cd by this artist . the music is very beautiful and her voice is perfect .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this cd had some good song , but the cd cover art is very generic . the song are good on there , but not great . the cd is not worth it .
0	if you like the dave clark five and their classic song , i suggest you look up the greatest hit . it is a great album . and i will always recommend not listening to their cover of song like heart of glass because they sound like they were a bunch of 12 year old kid trying to imitate gnr . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i have been a fan of kelly clarkson for year . i have bought her album and single and have always been pretty happy with them . however , i wanted to see how she could do when she recorded on her own . this is not kelly clarkson , not at all .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i have been listening to this for a few hour now and it is just not cutting it for me . it sound flat , boring , and just plain bad . it also seems like i am listening to the same song over and over again and not moving on much . maybe if i really get into it i will find it more enjoyable .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i can not get the cd to play on my ipod . i have tried four different ipod .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this is a good cd , but you should probably get the other one first .
0	i saw this movie when i wa twelve . i had no idea that i would love it or what i would love about it . i wa also not aware that i would be a fan of the beatles . i wa in awe of the music .
0	i have a friend who is a very big fan of the grateful dead . i asked him for his recommendation . he recommended this album and i have already bought it . the sound quality is very good . the only con is that the shipping cost is exhorbitant .
0	so she is great , but if you dont like it , you should not listen to her
0	i like this song . i like this song . i like this song . i like it ! i like this song ! i like this song . i like this song ! i like this song ! i like this song !
0	i agree with your overall statement . i would take this cd with le than 6 song . the song that i would take with more than 6 song are the song that i love the most from the first four album . - i can not wait to hear the song that i love the most from the first four album . - i do not know about the song that i liked on this cd . i have not heard any of them . only two of my favorite song from the first four album are on this cd . there are 5 that i liked on this cd . - most of the song on this cd are repeat from the first four album . - i do not know if i will like the song on this cd . -
0	this song wa made in the 1970s .
0	i got the music for my brother birthday . he had a hard time finding the right song . this one is one i can think of . it is a pop song . very soft . the song is for a girl day .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	i am looking forward to the next album . great song !
1	it is a good song , although some part are a bit annoying , i like the song , it is good .
0	i am happy about the demo release . i wa very dissapointed about the demo . it is not for everyone but for me it wasnt .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	karajannamed 81 on january 17 , 1984 , and he continued to give concert and recording . the first ofthese wa in toronto , canada , in november 1979 .
0	the beatles are the most popular group in the world . this album is not only one of the best beatles album , but also one of the best recording of their song and the beatles sound .
0	love her music . love the new cd . can not wait til the new cd come out .
0	love this lady . she is a great singer and an awesome songwriter .
0	this album of worship song is very good . there are a few song that are really good , but the whole album is not very good . the song are not very long and the song do not fit with the style of worship . i have not heard any song that are not christian . the song are not worship song . overall , this is a good album that give a variety of song . i would not recommend this album .
1	i am currently in between phone and would like to get a g2 . i would like to get one with the keyboard and the voice command . the battery last all day and the screen is bright , so
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i bought this cd a a christmas gift for my daughter . i will probably buy the cd again and will be purchasing the cd again for the cd of the year .
0	i agree , this is a horrible album . i am not sure i would reccomend anyone to buy it . the lead singer is an idiot . his singing is awful . i would not buy this album . the lead singer is a total joke .
1	i wa wondering how i got on to this . i wa not surprised . this is a big seller and i expect it to keep in it top-10 seller for some time .
0	i do not like this album .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i really love this song i really love this song and i am going to buy it .
1	this is my first purchase from this artist . i have tried a few other artist and this is by far my favorite
0	i have been a fan of prince since his birth . i purchased this album shortly after his death . i wa saddened to learn his passing , however , i found it to be an excellent album that had a message for all people that are struggling with life .
1	this is the first album i have ever been able to find of this band . they are excellent live and have an amazing sound .
1	i love it . i love that he can sing . the song is very catchy . it reminds me of i want you back by backstreet boy , and i love that . it is very cute and charming .
1	i downloaded a bunch of these song for my friend and family to sing . they all love this song . it is a really good song .
0	i am on the fence for this one , it is not too bad but i have found i am a lonesome fugitive to be a better song . i think that both of these song are great , but i am leaning toward the pistol annies version .
0	this is my 2nd favorite dave clark five song . this is an excellent mix of rock music and then adding dave clark five version . this is a really good mix of rock music and then adding dave clark five version .
0	this album ha a great song in it called my heart . it doe not get stuck in my head . it help me to remember that it is ok to feel bad and i am not alone .
1	this is a great cd , and i recommend it to everyone .
0	this is an average song . i like it , but i think it would be better played by a male singer . the music is very basic , but at the same time it is really catchy . the only thing i do not like about it is the lyric .
1	i like rock music , and this song is one of my favorite song , i like the fact that it is a new song from a new band ( well , the song is new , but they were a band from the 80 not the 60 ) . i like the fact that it is different from the other song on the album . the song is very positive and very uplifting .
1	i love the song praise the lord . this is one of my favorite song ever . i love how he take a simple lyric and make it to a great song .
0	i love this song . it is one of my favorite , but this just is not my cup of tea . it is just not my cup of tea .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this song is not a great song . i do not think it is a good cover . the song is ok , not great . i do not like the cover and the band sound too similar .
1	just another great prince album , i wa hoping for a hit , but no , i am happy with this album . prince is back with another great album . this album is great , really good song , great production , and great vocal .
0	i just wanted to let you know that i enjoyed the song and i liked the song . it is been a great tune to play on my car stereo . i would recommend this to anyone . i would like to buy it , but i could not afford it . i have to get back to you on that one . i hope you do not mind me asking , but wa the song written by someone or wa it written for someone ?
0	this is the only album i have purchased on vinyl . i think i am going to purchase this on cd . and , i have never been disappointed with a cd i have purchased in the past . so , i think i am going to purchase this on cd . the vocal are still there , a are the song . they just sound so much better on a cd . the music , a far a the song go , is so much better on a cd . i think it is better on a cd than on the vinyl . the song you can play on a cd are much better . what is not to like ? but , this album is a mess ! and i am not sure what album i should review this on . this album is a mess ! and i am not sure if this is the best album i have ever purchased .
0	the guitar are great . it is funny , but i did not really hear a lot of guitar
1	i love the song hey jude .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i really like this album . i think it is better than the first one . the song are good . also , the lyric are great .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	a great song with a great performance . very good .
0	i am going to have to agree with the anonymous reviewer . this is not a good album . the song are ok , but the music is awful . it is not worth the $ 14.99 . i will put this down a a non-recommended album .
1	i love this song .
1	i am enjoying this album and this song is amazing . it is a great song .
0	i like the music and the singing but the album is not worth $ 20 .

1	this song is so perfect for me everytime . i know i should not listen to this song . i just want to sleep but i like this song . this is my favorite song of the album
1	a nice cd . i like the fact that they play a bit of the beethoven 9th prelude . it is in the middle of the cd , so it is not a distracting a it is on a typical cd .
0	this album ha a killer hook , but i do not like the whole song . robert
0	i would give this a 5 star rating if it were not for the stupidly long cd copy . it is the original copy of the album purchased by me for over 25 year . i bought it in 1989 and i still have it despite having it copied on cd by amazon . i can not understand why anyone would copy it . i am a big fan of allen , but not of the cd .
0	this song is so powerful . even though i am not a singer , i can tell they were trying to make a song about me . i need to find someone to listen to this .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i love the first song she wrote . i really like this version , too . she is not the first to cover a song , but she is the first to attempt to write a song that is a good a the original .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	a very enjoyable song . the chorus is kinda catchy but i do not really like it a much a the other song in the album . it is a little repetitive but not too bad to the point that it annoys me and i can not stand it . it is a lot better than when you hear the beat , but it doe not compare to let u do the time warp , which is one of my favorite song .
1	i have heard this album for the last two day now and i really enjoyed

0	it wa good but she isnt the best and it annoying , ive always liked her music but i had to listen to this all the time and it getting on my nerve
1	this is a very good song and i love it .
1	this song reminds me of a lot of david lee roth early music . very high pitched vocal and a great guitar riff .
1	i love this song ! i think it is one the best written song in a while . i think lareine ha more song like this . i do not care if it is not a hit or not ( because it is good ) . i love it !

1	i am an old soul and it is about time a good christian music album came out . the christmas album from the original artist , not the christian artist . it just wasnt the christmas album i wa looking for . it is good , but it wa not the christmas album i wa looking for . i still like it though . i did enjoy listening to it .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i like john ; i like the music he writes .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i have loved this song since i heard it on the radio . it is so simple , yet so deep . the lyric are very meaningful .
0	just got done listening to this cd . i love the music . i love the lyric . i am glad i bought this cd . i am glad i bought this cd . i am glad this cd wa released . i am glad i bought this cd . i am glad these guy are releasing a cd . i am glad i bought this cd . i am just glad this cd is released . they are really talented people . i am glad this cd wa released . they are really talented people . i am glad this record wa released . they are really talented people . i am glad i bought this cd . i am glad they put this cd out . i am glad they put this cd out . this cd wa released . this cd wa released . this cd wa released . i wish i could afford to buy this cd . i wish i could afford to buy this cd . i am glad i bought this cd . i love this song . this cd is great . i love this song .
1	i think that this album is great . it is different from the other r & b album that i have heard , and the song are fun . i will buy this album again .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this is a great song , but it is just not the kind of song i wa hoping for . i wa hoping for an art pop , or even a more traditional rock song . but not this art pop crap . it is not the kind of song i would have ever chosen for my christmas list ( i know , right ? you see , i am a big believer in the notion that music should be about more than just just the lyric . of course there are the lyric , but there is more to music than just the lyric ) .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i wa looking for more positive song for my car stereo and this is just what i wa looking for ! i would recommend this song to anyone who ha a problem . good message !
0	love the song . what is wrong with miley ? it is not like she is not a good singer , or a good performer . she is not a bad singer , she is just a terrible performer .
1	a fantastic recording . i will be listening to it over and over again .
0	just purchased this cd . i wa really excited to hear it and wa looking forward to it . once i heard it , i realized i should not have . the singer sound like an eight year old and the sound quality is horrible . i can not stand it . i am glad i have my copy . it is much better to listen to in the car . the quality of the cd is so low that i can not even enjoy the sound . so i am sorry to say , you should check it out once before buying it . it is a waste of your money .
0	i like this beatles song . it is a great song !
0	i love this album , and have been singing , and listening to it , since the day it wa released . i agree with the reviewer that the music is beautiful , but i disagree with the review that it ha no message . i think that the message of the album is very important . the message is very important , and it is more than just one song . the message of the album can be summarized a christ is the only answer to all our problem . i love the song praise god because all of the word used in the song are taken from scripture . they describe a picture of a savior that we should be looking for , someone who is greater than our self . and then on the song my savior , she make a very personal statement about her savior and how very much that she love him . i just want to praise you , praise you , praise you , praise you . i am sure that a great many people have been touched by this cd , and there are many others . but , i love this cd because i can sing along to it , and i can feel the emotion it stir . i also love the way that she sings the song . the way that she sings is very personal . she is so expressive . it feel like she is speaking directly to me . and , the way that she sings , she is able to put the word that she sings into my heart . she is able to speak to my heart ; she can say to my heart ; i love you . i think that i may have just found the perfect cd . i have also heard that she ha recorded a book that ha been published by crossway book . i hope that they are able to release this cd . i can not wait to hear it . i do not have any more to say . i hope that you find this review helpful .
0	hasselvander sang very well . the song were very good . i agree with the reviewer on the other review . the song are not available on itunes .
1	this is a beautiful , great cover of the original version of this song .
0	i like this song and i have recorded it myself at home . but , i do not know if i should buy it , because the quality of the recording is really bad .
0	i used to like marie osmonds song but after listening to this cd i feel like she wa just trying to live up to a very high expectation for herself . her voice is great but i can not stand how she sings . i do not mean like her voice is bad , no , i thought she wa a wonderful singer , but there is just something about her voice that make me want to turn my back on her .
1	i wa excited to receive the jewel cd this year . i have been a jewel fan for many year . it wa nice to finally have her cd . it is beautiful
1	it is a great song . i have never heard it before , but i think it is a great song .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i have listened to this jazz album several time . i am not a big coltrane fan , but i enjoyed his music . the new coltrane is different from the old one , but i enjoy it anyway . if you like coltrane , you will like this cd .
0	i like the music but i think the video is really stupid .
1	i think that this album is a great attempt to reinvent her style and her musical identity .
1	this song just make me feel happy and like a new person . i love lorde and i love her song . i love this song because i love lorde and i love that she is trying to show different side to herself .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i love this cd , i have listened to it so much i think i am going to buy it .
0	this is one of the more interesting song i have ever heard . it is very , very slow . it start with a very slow melody , and it sound more like a lullaby than a song . but it get more interesting once it enters the chorus . and once the chorus is sung , it reach a speed that is very pleasant . i love this song . i like being the one to play it on the radio . it reminds me of the way a car radio sound when you start it up and turn it up . it is an interesting song .
0	a very enjoyable recording .
0	i bought the original lighthouse version from the site . it is a great song . i also have some of the other version of this song from the site . all are great song , but this one is the best . this is an excellent version . i have listened to it on and off for the past year . i really like it .
0	i would give it 4.5 star if i could .
0	it is very good , but it doe not have that something about it that make me want to buy it . i like the guitar work and the vocal are good . the keyboard solo are good tho . a little bit repetitive .
1	i do not like the song when i hear it in my head , but then when i hear it on the radio , i like it . i have also liked some of the song , but i only like the one when i hear them in my head . this song is the exception to the rule . i think i will like it better on the radio .
0	this is a pretty good version of i am on fire from top gun .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	miley need to just stop lying . i do not think she is a drug addict . i think she is a drug addict .

1	i like the message behind this song . i really like it .
1	very relaxing . the first song is only the opening part of the longer prelude to the choral piece . the other song are all great .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	this is a great christmas song that is simple and uplifting . i believe this is a great christmas song . i love it . i believe this is a great christmas song . i love the fact that i can sing this to my family and friend .
0	this is not a bad song . the vocal are okay , but the music is not very good . there is a lot of instrumentation on this release , but it doe not really stand out from the rest of the track . it is a good release , but it just doe not stand out from the other release in the genre .
1	i love this video ! it is very entertaining .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	one of the most enjoyable album that i have ever listened to . so good , i do not know whether to call it a masterpiece or a bomb . the beatles were amazing back then and this group definitely have their own sound and style . they are also super-fast and do not waste any time . highly recommended .
1	this is beethoven 9th with all 18 musician . it is a gorgeous cd .
0	i love your music , it brings back the good old day
1	i really enjoyed listening to the song on this cd . i like listening to the cd .
0	i am a total idiot . i wa downloading the song that say you are the sun , you are the moon , you are the star , you are the man , from this site . i am in the middle of the song and i click on the icon to listen to it , and now i have the song downloaded on my mp3 player . now i can not find my mp3 player . my computer say the file is corrupted . i do not know what to do .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i am not going to play this for my daughter , she like a nice pop song , not thesesongs . i do not even know if i want my daughter to listen to em . i am glad it is not in an mp3 format because i would not want to risk damaging her ear .
1	this album rock !
1	this is a great song . i would like to hear more song from this album .
1	this song will make you cry , but i would not recommend it . it is very powerful and emotional . if you want to listen to a happy song , then this is not the song for you . i like this song but i wish they would have said something like i am a bad girl . i am a bad boy .
0	this is not a bad album , but i wa not really fond of tom wait . he doe not really try to be a great singer , but rather just sings what come to mind . i am not sure how tom wait can carry a tune or make a vocal sound like he is singing . i am glad i never saw the piano lesson or i would not have bought this cd , if it were not for the fact that i enjoy listening to tom wait so much .
1	i wa listening to this album earlier , and i am so grateful that i did . i love the arrangement and the harmony . the song are very powerful . i love the harmony and the arrangement . i love the harmony and the arrangement . i love this cd more and more each day .

1	i have heard all of ohearns album and this one ha the best song . this album is one of the best one i have ever heard . i have listened to this album a few time and this is the only album i have never been disappointed with .
1	i bought this cd because i love some good year . i love it . i bought it in 1989 and it still sings to me . it is a great collection and should be bought by all music fan .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this album is a great album . i love this album . i love the guitar , drumming and piano , it is very good .
1	thank you for the music . it is been a while since i have been able to listen to music so it is been hard to decide whether i should have written this . after listening to the cd , i have decided that i did not . i feel like i need to tell someone about this cd before i forget it . i just finished listening to it . i feel like someone who wa reading a book and just put it down . it is not because it wa bad . i just feel like i can not remember it . it is just a memory . it will take me some time to listen to the whole cd . i listened to the cd because it wa on a book for church . i listened to the cd because i need to listen to christian music and i could not find anything good . i needed to hear something that i would like and i found this cd . i feel like i need to tell someone about this cd before i forgot it .
1	i love this album . i got it for my birthday and i have been listening to it every day since . it is good music .

1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	the song she is got a place is so typical madonna . a song about an entitled woman who ha a better life than the rest of the world . it is like the story of a poor girl who is trying to get into a better school so she can get into the class that will get her a better life .
0	i have been listening to this one all day . i have found that many of the song on here are very good , so i did not notice the bad one until i listened to them the second time .
1	i would say that this album is good , but not great . i have heard so many people praise this album , but i just do not think it is that good . i would say that the album is good , but it just doe not seem to have the music to last . the song are good , but they just do not last . i
0	the only cd that i have received in a cracked case wa the first one , the cd wa fine , just opened it up and it wa fine . the 2nd cd wa in a cracked case and the case wa cracked a well . i will be returning this cd in a cracked case a well . the second cd wa not a good a the first one . i would recommend for anyone to put the cd in a cd case .
0	i love r & b ! i really like it .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i really liked this album and have given it a couple listens . i do not think it is the best album of the year , but it is good .
0	i can not stop listening to this song !
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i have very rarely purchased ( or listened to ) a song or album that i did not find interesting . i am not sure why i am doing this now , but i am . i am listening to the new jewel album , the language of flower , and i am surprised that i found it lacking . it is not that the music is bad ; it is that there is not a single redeeming moment in this cd . it is really disappointing . and not just to me ; it is disappointing to the fan who helped her to record and release this stellar cd .
0	this song is nice . i like it a lot . i can not get enough of it .
1	i have nothing negative to say about this song . i love the video , it is very funny and the artist voice is great .
0	this song is really annoying .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	this song suck and is a cover band . i will check out the next song .
0	a good album . the song do not come around here no more is one of the better song on the album . the lyric are funny , and it is a good album . i liked the humor of this album . i had a few thought . i thought the first song wa a great example of tom waite , and the other song have been pretty funny . there are a few good song on this album . the lyric are funny , and the song i walked with a zombie is good . i liked i walked with a zombie the best , and i liked the devil went down to georgia a little better . i did not like the last song , and i thought the last song wa just not funny at all . the last song is just not funny at all . i think this album is a bit of a let down to a lot of people , because i had never heard a tom wait album before , but i still like the album .
0	i have only seen the fall from grace video on youtube . i can not believe a 5 year old girl would sing a song like that . i think she is so sweet and lovable , she doe not deserve to be singing about her ex-husband . i really hope she doe not sing that song in the future .

0	i really like this song . it is a good song .
1	i bought this album in advance ( since it wa the last issue ) so i had a chance to listen to it on my drive home from work . i heard a lot of great thing about the band when i listened to it online . i then bought it from the local thrift store . they do not have any cd by this band so i bought it from them and it came with a nice cover and a nice booklet . it is one of those cd that you buy and give it to your friend to listen to .
1	i love the song so much it give me chill every time i hear it .
0	this band is awesome . i love the way they play and the way they write . it is definitely not a rock kind of band . like the guy say , we just do not do rock n roll just the way they do it . this is a great band that can do it all . they have two very distinctive lead singer and they both have a ton of talent , so if you like their sound , you are in for a treat ! this is a really good album that will get you into music very quickly and will keep you listening all the way to the end .
0	this is one of those album that when it hit you at a particular point in your life , it is just the best thing you have ever heard .

0	i listened to this song quite a lot , and this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i loved this song and would like to hear other people sing it . i guess i could change the ending , but i just thought it wa a little too long for me . i do not know what i would change . i just thought the ending did not sound a good a it could have sounded .
1	he is a great singer with a beautiful voice and great lyric . his music is very personal to me . he is a true artist . i am giving him 5 star , although he is on the high end of my favorite and i really did like him . i just think he should get more credit for his talent .
1	this is very good . this is better than the dave clark five version at this point .
0	i like this song .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i wa driving home from work last night when this song came on . i am not a fan of i am a believer , but i love you have got a friend in me and i need love . this last one really hit me .
0	this is amazing and the best compilation of ansermets recording i have heard . it is better than most record of the same and the sound is fantastic . the best thing is it is all here and not on a cd . the playing is fantastic for the most part and the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined the experience for me .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i have been searching for a good-quality copy of this album for several year now . the music is a little thin , but i can live with it . it is also a very well-produced album . the album is also quite expensive ( especially the vinyl ) which doe not make sense , considering that the entire album wa produced in a very short period of time ( le than three year ) .
0	i wa disappointed . the song wasnt really a uptown funk song . it wa more like a uptown funk song . but they put better word .

1	i have a collection of greatest recording from the 60 that i have purchased over the year . i have a karajan recording that wa one of the best on the list , but i did not think i would like this recording . it is called the world is waiting for the sunrise . it is only an extremely short recording , but it is also extremely beautiful . the music that is played on the piano and the violin ( and the violin solo ) are fantastic . there is just no getting around the beauty and emotional intensity of this recording .
1	i am a jewel fan for many year . i have been telling her that since i wa 11. this is the best album i have ever heard .
0	i do not like this song . i think it is a little too similar to other song by hasselvander .

1	this song make me feel alive . i feel great when i hear this song .
0	i do not know if you are actually listening to this song , or if you are just trying to write a positive review . you can not even get up off your lazy as .
1	this is a good cd , but on the other hand , i would like to buy the other song from the cd . there is a nude song which is a good song but there is also a breathless song which is a bad song . the breathless song is much better . i like both of them .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .

1	this wa a nice clean version .
0	i saw it . i thought it wa very good . i thought it wa a good show . i just did not have any energy left in it , which is a shame .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i liked it , but i do not think i would buy it again . i did not like the vocal . the sound quality is great , and the track order could have been different .
0	i am not going to buy this cd from amazon . i do not want to waste my money . i have already seen the cd and it is not good . ( not much of a cd )
0	what happened to this song ? i like the first version better than this one . it is not the best song ever , but it is a good song . i do not find it to be a bad song , either , but i do not think i would listen to it over the first version .
1	i love my window phone but my laptop is way better
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .

0	i really like this album but i only give it a 3. i have only heard the song when i have been to the store and listened to the album . it is not bad but i think it is a bit generic . i will have to check out the broadway album .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i have this cd and i am so happy i found it . this is not a real cd by the way , it is a compilation of 5 song from the album which are on the cd . i love listening to music and i do not normally buy cd but i have this cd and am going to order another one . i love the cover art .
0	kiss is one of the song that i like the most . it is a really fun danceable song , and if it happens to get on the radio , i will be sure to play it . the only thing that i do not like is the lyric , because they were written in a way that is not too positive , but in a way that make it seem positive . i would not know about this music if it were not for this song . i do not know what the song is trying to say , but it is just not good . i would rather listen to something that is bad than listen to something that is good .
0	i really like this song .

0	one of the better mike varney tribute album that is le like his usual type of stuff and more like an album of his music . i do not think that i have ever heard him play guitar like this before . i like the fact that he ha sung a song where he sings i could not love you and you could not leave . it is a soulful song . i like it and it is my favorite . i would give it a rating of a- . mike varney wa a talented musician and a great friend to many .

0	this is a good song . it is got a good beat and the song itself is very interesting .
0	i have listened to this cd for several day , and i love it ! the song are good and i like that she is a singer who really sings and love the music . i like the way she sings and i like the way she sound . i like the way she sings with the piano and the way she sings with the band . i like the song that she sings and i like the way she sings . i hope that this cd will be popular and that there will be other cd .
0	i have listened to this album for many year and it is my favorite recording of the gershwin recording .
1	it is a great collection of oldie . i really enjoyed it .
0	i really enjoyed this album ! i have not listened to this album since i wa in high school , however it is still a great album .
0	this is a really good album . the song are good . i would not say the album is bad , i just do not like it . i do think it is good , but i think it is good for a lot of different reason . it is a good album to listen to if you do not like music , because it is not heavy metal , it is not rap , and it is not rock . it is just really good music .
1	i have listened to this song so many time that i have decided it is a pop song . it is catchy and the chorus sound fun . the first time i listened to this song , i just could not believe that i had actually heard it before . i have heard other song like this , but none that i like . it sound like a pop song , but i think it is better . enjoy .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this song made me feel happy .
1	i love the song on this album . they are wonderful .
0	i have been a fan of ohearn since i first heard his music and i wa very suprised by the quality of this recording . his singing ha always been very powerful and i can tell that the recording is very good . very few people can sing this well . i have been a fan of his for over 30 year and have bought all of his album . this album is my favorite .
0	i always had a problem with this song . i liked the song but there wa always a problem with the lyric . this is like the i am in love with myself problem . it is an interesting song but not everyone can relate to it . i think it is a great tune and is very enjoyable . i have a lot of respect for tom wait , but this song is a joke . i do not think it is a terrible song but it is a very weak effort that i can never get behind .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this song is extremely catchy and addictive . it is very easy to sing along to . the song is very good and i like it a lot . the lyric are also very good . in fact , the best lyric i have ever heard .
1	i love this video ! i have heard this song many time and i find it to be so inspirational and it always make me think , and believe , that we can make it .
0	this song is very very awesome and i have been singing it for year . when i sing the word i feel like i am in church with god . it is one of my favorite song .
1	i have listened to this album for 2 day now and i really like this album . the album ha a lot of good song and the song have a lot of good melody . the song are very well made and the song structure is very good . the best thing about this album is the quality of the music .
1	i love bruno mar and his music . this song brings me to tear .
0	i wa looking forward to buying this cd . i pre ordered it on amazon and i wa hoping to hear her latest cd . after listening to it , i just could not get into it . i do not know if this cd will be any good or not . but i have never disliked a cd so much .

1	this is an excellent album . i did not know what to expect coming in so i wa a bit nervous . the album ha a lot of great song , and i love that they kept the music the same and did not change the name of the song . i love the song i can not stop loving you and candy girl . this album is so much better than the previous album ! it is not just better , it is great !
0	i love this cd . it is great . it is a simple and catchy cd . i love it .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i like the song on this album but they are very strange and dull .
0	i agree that the song are not worth listening to . the worst part about it is that the lead singer is not a gifted singer . the lead singer sings like he is a robot . the worst thing about the song are that they are so repetitive . the lead singer doe not have the ability to write his own song . the lead singer ha nothing to offer and i can not believe anyone would buy this album .
0	i have never been a fan of sam sparro . i wa looking forward to his black and gold performance . that turned out to be a disappointment . i have been looking forward to this album , and i am disappointed . i thought it wa going to be good . i listened to this song and had to turn it off . what a let down . this is not the type of music i listen to . i will keep the record because it is more of a novelty than music , but i will not buy it .
0	this is great ! the vocal are awesome , the lyric are great , the instrumentals are awesome ! very good album !
0	this song wa used in the movie pulp fiction . i wa wondering if the original version wa better .
0	it is a nice album of pop song that have little to nothing to do with the song , but are in the style of an album . i do not like it .
1	the performance on this collection are all superb , but the overall recording quality is not up to par . this is not a fault of the performer , though . it is not even a fault of the studio . it is just a fact that this collection contains all of the performance on a single disc and that the music is mixed too well ( especially in the bass , where some instrument are inaudible ) . the sound is very bright , though , and i think it is preferable to what you could hear on a single compact disc .
1	i have been searching for this cd for year and finally i found it . this is a great cd . it ha all the music from the cd i bought a year ago . the song i am glad is a good song , but the song i will be and i belong to you are great , too .
1	is an excellent album , with a rock feel to it , it can be enjoyed by all . even though it is a little old for me , i still like it . i have listened to it more than 50 time , but still enjoy it . if you like band like : ac/dc , led zeppelin , and iron maiden , this is a great album for you .
1	i really like this cd . all song are superb , and the variety is great . great cd , great price .
0	i am not the kind of person to complain about a good product . this cd is not great . for people who like their music rockin . i had to force myself to finish the 5 song . that is all . there are way too many bad song , and way too many good song . i wish it wa a cd of just song i like . i could only listen to the dave clark five on this one cd . it got a thumb down from me in the amazon rating . i will have to wait until it sell to get a cd with only my favorite song .
0	i liked the band first two record , but this one is not good , and i am disappointed in the band decision to discontinue the second album and go back to their earlier sound .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i love this song , but i do not like the way he sings it . he need to sing it more like it is supposed to be sung .
1	this cd is a

1	i really enjoyed the song . i have always been a fan of barbra
0	this is a classic . david lee roth ha written some great song . but , this is the only one that i have seen him sing , so i have not heard him a a vocalist . i am a fan of his music . it is great for the lyric , but i have not heard him sing it . this is a great song , but it is not the best that i have ever heard . the instrumentals are very catchy , but i do not like the song a much a the lyric . i give this album 2 star .
0	i am not a big fan of jewel stuff , but this is a great comeback . it is not a bad song , and david lee roth is the real deal . if you want to hear all of david lee roth other song , you need to buy his first solo album , which is still worth owning ( despite this being his last recording ) . but if jewel is your favorite band , save your money and buy this instead . i like this better than her other stuff , but i understand why some people do not .
1	this is such a catchy and fun song . it make me feel happy and good . the lyric are really cute . the video is cute too . this song is a really great dance song . i can not wait to see the video . i love it .
0	the lyric are great , the song is great but i do not like the music .
1	i am glad i purchased this album . you can tell by the album cover that it wa released in 1978 , and it wa a big hit back then , so i am glad i bought it , and i do not regret it one bit .
1	this is a great collection that should be listened to with an open mind . the beatles first went electric when they played the stadium . in concert , this wa a unique experience . after all , they were playing the biggest stage in the world for the world biggest band .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i like this cd , it is a great cd full of really good song and some really good dance move . the song are all different from each other and it is definitely a different band for me .
0	i love my wife and she ha a love for this song . it is always on in the house even when she is not singing it . it is just something that she will sing along with for day . i do not know if i would have ever heard this song in a commercial that i thought wa catchy . it is just a wonderful song and i feel like it missing from the radio at the moment .
0	this song is ok , but it is not bad . the vocal are fine and it ha a nice beat . it is a good song .
0	it is a very nice album . i prefer that she try to find her own voice , instead of always trying to be the same thing . this will be her last album .
1	this is excellent . i like this song .
0	this song ha always been played in my band show . i also have seen it used in a lot of show and the crowd love it .
1	this album really got the song out of me .
0	a a singer , i can tell you that the dave clark five is a group that ha very few hit . they have been doing their thing for over 60 year . they have never had a hit that i can listen to . this album is their best yet and i am glad it is on cd .
1	the album is a masterpiece .
1	this album wa amazing . the vocal on the song are great , and the melody on the song are great .
0	i love to hear this song and i really like her vocal
1	i did not think some good year wa a country song , but it is . i will be adding this to my collection . i love i am so lonesome i can cry . it is a favorite of mine .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	maria is back ! this is maria best release yet . i love it ! it is just beautiful .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i love the guitar solo on the song the last night !
1	i really love it .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i like this song a lot .
1	i am not a fan of this song , but i am glad i bought it . the song is really good . the backing melody is cute and nice . i like the message in it , and the singer doe a good job . the instrumentation is great , and the lyric are good to read .
1	i love this song ! i listened to it for a long time and wrote a review on it . i think it is one of lordes best song . this song is very good . very happy and love it . i hope the album is better . i do not know about the lyric , but this song is very good . i will listen often !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i think this is a good song . i like the flow .
1	this is probably my favorite song so far . it is a very good song , and i think that it is just a good with or without the choir .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i do not have a huge amount of expectation for this album , but i really liked the first two song . i do not like the way the last song sound like a techno song . i do not know if it is the vocalist or the album or where i am at in my life , but i am going to give it a chance .
1	great song on a great album . i love it ! i listened to the other song on this cd too . i wanted to say that this cd is very good . i like all of your song . i hope you will be performing in the future . i hope to see you in concert soon . i really appreciate you taking the time to review this cd . thank you .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i love this ! i love the song i sing out loud to my child and then record it , and listen to it many time again ! the reason i love this song is because it is so simple yet so beautiful ! i also love the word and the music is so beautiful !
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i love this . it is a great song for any occasion . it always make me think of my daughter , whenever i am driving , i will try to think of something positive i could say to make her feel better .
1	i love this cd , it got me excited and i wanted to find more bruno mar song .
1	i love this record . it is a wonderful collection of music .
1	i really like the song , i love the music .
1	this album is the only beatles album i have ever heard and i love it
1	great song . i love this song and the video .
1	i like john . prine ; he is a very talented singer songwriter , and he sings in tune . i like john at live show .
1	great harmony and melody ! i think this is a great piece of music . you should check him out .
1	tom scott-the unheard is a great album . i love the arrangement .
1	i really love this album ! i love this album ! i love this album ! this is a really good album
0	this is the first bonnie tatum cd i have ever heard . i wa excited to hear her music . i love her song and i know she is a very gifted person .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	i like it . i like the band . i like the music . i like the band . i like the music .
1	this is absolutely one of my favorite . i will never forget it .
0	i have a few of these in my collection . the music is very good , but the lyric are a little confusing . i really like the video .
0	very good , i like the beatles , and this is a great album .
1	this cd is relaxing .
1	i like lareines voice ! i can not imagine being a singer but i can imagine being a song writer because she can hit the note and sing them !
0	one of the best of the best , hand down . the song are wonderful . and i have always been a fan of marie osmonds music . i love this cd , and i do not know if i even need to mention the cd in the review . it is a great album .
0	this is for the person who want to hear something loud that is not bad .
0	i first saw this band in the late 80 . their music had a very unique sound that i fell in love with . i have been a fan of the band ever since , and their music ha followed me all over the world . i listen to their song whenever i travel , and have been a fan of the band ever since i first saw them .
1	i really like barbra streisand .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	another one-dimensional singer trying to be another singer .
1	i have two song from this album , and i love them both . i have the cd , and i love it . i have to say that i do not like this album because it is so short ( 11 song ) . but i like it . overall , i am very happy with it .
1	i have listened to this collection on my i-pod touch 3g , and it sound great ! it is great to hear song that i have loved , and it is great to hear song that i have never heard before .
1	this is an awesome album . it is a bit old now , but i still love it . i do not like the other song , but i have to say this one is really good . it is really different musically and i love it .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	this is a cover of a paul mccartney song . it is not a great song , but it is good .
1	i love everything about music . i love the way it take me into a different world . i love the way the lyric affect me ; i love the way the song take me into a different world . i love the way the melody move me . i love the way the music will make me feel . i love the way it affect me and i love the way it will affect my life . i think this album will be great for everyone if they are a lover of great music and love great music is a real thing .
0	i liked the album , i wa really excited to hear it , but i had high expectation , and it wa a let down . i did enjoy the song , but it just did not have the same impact that they had in state of trance 2008 .
1	i downloaded this cd to listen to while waiting for my car to be fixed .
1	not sure if this is a true review or a review of a song , but here go . i wa listening to this on a cell phone and it sounded very nice . i have had a lot of trouble with the sound of my cell phone and this sounded very nice . the only problem i had wa that i had to rewind to get to the beginning of the song and then i had to slow down the music to hear the rest of the song .
0	this is a great album but the song are all over the place and the great bit is a bit over hyped .
1	i agree barbra is a great singer , but i
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !

1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	if you like this song and do not know what to say then just look away .
0	i would like this to be a little more complete a the song are not completely the same a the first album . the first album the sound of jazz by frank sinatra and george gershwin wa released in 1959. which wa a year before george gershwin masterpiece , summertime . the second album by frank sinatra and billy may wa released in 1961. both album are excellent but the 1959 album is the better of the two . the song on this album are very good . they were all written by the frank sinatra and billy may . sinatra would later write many more song with billy may .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

1	steve morse is one of the most underrated guitarist of our time . his solo on this album are incredible .
1	i have listened to this album a lot . i have played it over and over . i like the song . but i do not like the band . i have heard this band before , but i have never heard it like this . the band sound very old school . they sound like they are playing a song from a 70 tv show . they are very old and very conservative . the band is called the big lebowski and they are from houston . the band is very good . the band ha been around since the 90 . it ha a lot of energy and a lot of fun . i have really liked all their album so far . the band ha been around since the 90 . i have only heard the first album called the big lebowski . the band ha not released anything else since then . but i really like the band . the band ha a lot of energy and a lot of fun . i have heard the song on the first album and the song on the cd of this album . i really like the first cd . the song on this cd are great . the song sound great . the band sound very good . the band is very good . it is a lot of fun . the music is different from the cd i had before . the band sound old . but it is a lot of fun .

0	i think this song is very cool . i like the part where they start singing the chorus .
0	this radio show is one of the best i have ever heard .
0	i absolutely love this album . it is very relaxing and the music is very soothing .
0	this album is a great one . it is a collection of song that are all about love . there are a couple of good tune here that are easy to listen to . but , some of the tune are a little repetitive . the vocal are nice . they are just a little too much , which is an issue on song that have a lot of repetition . but , overall , this is a great album .
0	lyrically , this is really good . song title : i am in love with a girl named katie . lyrically : katie , i am in love with you . i am in love with you . how can i live without you ? i will spend the rest of my life with you . i will never leave you . never . never can you know me like i know you . i am in love with you . i am in love with you . this is the first song the album ha . i have only listened to the first 13 song of the album . there are many song that i have not listened to . i wish i could give a more positive review , but the lyric are the best aspect of the album . the song i can see what is going on is the only song that i have listened to . overall , i give the album 3 star and a 6/10 .
1	this song is great . she is a great singer . it wa on her first cd . but by the time this cd came out , she wa a great singer and song writer . this is her best cd . she wa better than ever before . i have enjoyed every tom wait cd she is made and it is all worth listening to . she is a great artist and i love listening to her .
1	i think that the instrumentals are good . the vocal are overrated .
1	every male artist should make a song like this . this is my favourite song ! it is so sexy ! i love it ! i am soooo happy that i found this song . i can not wait to listen to it again !
0	barbra is the best singer around , and for a little while this album wa my favorite . then i realized that the album is too long , and i wasnt buying it . i still like it , but i do not think it is a great album . it wasnt her best , but it wa good . i liked the song , but did not love the album .
1	i have been listening to this album for year , but i know that i did not know him until i heard this album . this is my favorite . i love this album . the song all alone with something to say is just so beautiful . the song is so beautiful . it make me want to go to a concert , to go to a party , to do anything . this song just take me away . when i listen to it , i feel like i am in a room with a group of people singing together in harmony . it make me feel like i am in a room with a great group of people singing for me . it make me feel like i am at a group of people singing for the one i love .
1	this artist is very talented , but , i think that the music is very boring . all the music is a little too much in the same genre . i am disappointed that the cd wa not in a different genre . i will be purchasing the cd .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

1	this is a great song . i like the song and the artist .
1	this album wa one of my favorite one on the label , and i wa really hoping that they would rerelease it . i thought that the vocal were a lot better than the previous album , but the melody were not a good . i wa looking forward to the release of the album , but unfortunately , the album wa still not fully re-released . the sound quality is very good , and this album is still one of my favorite .

0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i can not remember the name of the song , but i love it . it is so simple but so effective . a great christian rock song .
1	tom waite is one of my all time favorite . i am not sure why , but i can not stand any of the more recent release . he is a legend and i will always be a fan . he would probably be disappointed to know that he ha been put down for a while . he ha a lot of other great album out . i will be getting the first one out this year . i just hope that it is a good a his other work .
0	this is really a good cd . it ha a lot of great song and a lot of really good musician . but the cd is a little too short and i would like to have had more song . all of the song are fantastic , but i think the cd could have had a few more song . i am going to buy a new cd and this is a great cd for the money . i would recommend this cd to a friend and i would order it again when i have more money . it is worth buying .
0	this song made me cry . but it is not a huge hit .
0	a song by the r. kelly group ? that is just weird . it sound like someone tried to write a song by lorde but ended up with a r. kelly song instead . r. kelly

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i have always liked this band , and i wa willing to try any of their album , but this one wa really disappointing . the vocal are okay , but the guitar and bass are not .
1	this is one of the best song that i have heard in age . i love the mix of style , and the lyric and the sound are all very unique .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	this is a new recording from the late great jan garbarek . i like it a lot . on the whole , it is not a great recording , but i do not think that it is bad all the same . the sound is a bit muffled - it is not the fault of the recording . the musicianship is good , and the song are well written . i do not know much about classical music , but i found that i could not hear any instrument , and that wa not a good thing . if you are a fan of jan garbarek , i would recommend this recording .
0	i had to give it a rating of +1 ( i liked it a lot ) . i think it wa a good album , but it wa not for me . i am not your ordinary american is my favorite song . i would like to hear a more complete album with all the song , but i think that is too much work .
0	i love this song . it just doe not seem to have that special magic that many of his other song do .
0	i had to buy this album . it ha been a long time since a new david lee roth album . i wa really disappointed when i heard this album came out . it wa just another album of great song that sounded like every other david lee roth album . it wa like listening to some other david lee roth album , but with a different singer . i have heard the best in david lee roth and i just do not like this album . it wa a great album in the past , but not now .
0	i wanted to download the song to practice . but it is a bad song .

1	i absolutely love the dave clark five ! i love the music , and i love the way that the music is performed . they play a real style of jazz that i really enjoy . i also really like the fact that they are a very good live band . i have heard them many time on the radio , and i would love to see them play again .
1	this
1	i love this band and the member are really talented . but this cover is a little too boring . too much white with the wrong sound .
0	i am a fan of early , alternative , post-punk band . i love them , and i would say that this is a very good compilation of some of the best . the band that i am most fond of is the one that i am reviewing today . i am not a huge fan of this band though . i like them though , and i liked their album , i love you all , which i am reviewing today . i would have to say that this is something that i will never ever listen to , and i am sure that i will be able to listen to this song on my own without any problem . but i feel that i would like to listen to it and other song on my own . however , the song the green dragon is not very good . i must say that i thought that it wa very good , but it is not a good a the album , i love you all . this is not their best work , but it is definitely their best work . i am not sure what the problem is with this song . they are very good at what they do , and i am sure that they are very good at what they do . i would still say that this is a very good album .
1	i have to say that this album ha been a real eye-opener . i wa expecting a bit more from this album than i have , and i really do not know enough about this kind of music to even begin to judge it properly . i have heard a lot of people say that this album is not mainstream but i disagree . it is very mainstream . i have listened to it on the drive to work . i have listened to it in the car when i am trying to fall asleep . i have listened to it while i am walking to work . and i have listened to it when i am doing some extra housework or doing some other chore that i do not enjoy . in short , i have listened to it all of the time . it is that good . i have been doing housework for about a month now , and i can tell you it is going to take some time to get used to it . however , i have to say that once you get used to it , it is really enjoyable . i highly recommend this album .

1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	in the beginning of this cd there were a few song that i thought were okay . but a i continued listening , i realized that they were much better than i thought . the whole album is good , i think it is one of your best cd .
0	this is an incredible trance album . it is got a lot of energy , a lot of amazing trance track and a great feel to it .
0	i like the song and have to say that it is a better song than the original . i think that it is a more happier song and i think that the original is better because of the word . they are just not a good a the word . i also like the original because the lyric are better but i still love this song .

1	great harmony super fourties group
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	this song ha a good beat , not to good to be a country song .
0	i love this album . the beatles were a great band . george harrison had a great voice , paul mccartney drum were amazing and ringo starr bass guitar style wa so unique . john lennon , of course , wa great . the only thing i do not like is that the album wa made before apple record . it would have been better if it wa a compilation album . i did not like back in the ussr because it is a one shot song . if they had made more album like this , the music industry would have continued .
1	this song make me want to dance .
1	this is a great band . i love when they do these live show . this is a great band to see live in person . i love the sound of this band .
1	steve morse ha really outdone himself on this album and the song punk rock and roll is one of the best song on the album .
0	i liked the first three song , but the last two just missed my ear . i wa hoping for a more epic song here and i wa hoping for something more of a rockabilly sound . i thought this wa a nice throwback to their earlier work , but i do not think they are a polished or polished enough to make me want to buy the album .
0	i bought this album to hear the song livin it up by the dave clark 5. this is a great song , but i am disappointed to find out it is not on this cd . i bought three of them and the one i got is the first one i had bought . i bought the two other one because i did not want to wait until the dave clark 5 cd wa available to buy it . this is a great song . unfortunately it is not on the cd .
1	i have been a fan of the dave clark five since i wa a teen-ager . i am now 40. i remember when they were just starting out . i remember how they were the coolest group on the planet . i remember them being a major influence on my music . i can not thank them enough for making me a fan . they are one of the few band and the only band that i listen to now . i hope they get a reissue someday . they deserve it . i think they deserve a rerelease of their first album , too much . i think that it is one of the best first album ever released .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	i wa at the gym yesterday and i saw a copy of this song on the treadmill . it is not exactly my cup of tea because i do not think it fit the vibe i like in a song .
1	this is the most incredible sound i have heard in a long time . i love this album .
1	this is one of prince best album . i have this on my ipod and listen to it all the time .
0	the cd is nice , but i find it repetitive . i am used to hearing r.kellys song the same way . i hate when artist repeat themselves . they tend to become predictable . the only reason i like it is the cover . it look very professional .
0	i thought this wa a great song the first time i heard it , but after all these year it is starting to get old .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i can not tell whether this is a song about a man lust for his wife or whether it is about a woman whose husband is cheating on her ( and/or their sex life is in shamble ) ? doe it matter ? this song is just so damn annoying . i would like for the song to be about that . i have heard it a few time . i am not bothered . this one wa the most annoying i have heard in a long time . i like the music , but the lyric are just plain annoying . i have heard them several time before . ( i can not help but think that if i were a woman , this song would make me cry . i can not relate to the guy in the song . i can not get into his head . i can not see the world through his eye . he doe not know me . he doe not know the only way i would ever make him happy is to walk away . )
0	i thought we were supposed to be rating the best live recording . the dave clark five , who recorded live in the same year a this recording , sound like they were having a good time . and i like them , even if i have no idea what they were actually singing about .
0	i love this song . i bought it and got it on cd . i do not own a cd player and it would be a great gift for someone .
0	i find it very hard to understand the lyric but i like the song .
0	i like this song a lot . but , i think it is not my favorite version . it is very corny and cheesy . the guitar solo is really annoying .
0	i first heard this band in the late 80 . their music had a very unique style that i fell in love with . i have been a fan of the group ever since , and their music ha followed me all around the world . i listen to their song whenever i travel , and have always been a fan of the band .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .

1	i love my iphone
1	this is a
0	i have to agree with you
1	if you love prince , you got ta check out the album called the vault from prince ex-wife and new wife . i know this album is called the vault , but prince ex wife and new wife wrote the song on this album .
0	it is the same old thing ( except it is played on the same old instrument ) , yet it is still a great song . i like the song and the melody and harmony are great . i like the song , but i do not like the version they have played on the cd . i would like to give this song a chance , but it is just got to be different .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	this is just bad . the song is not good at all .
1	i love this album , but it is not my favorite . the production is great , and the guitar playing is awesome , but the vocal are a letdown . the lyric are good though .
0	i wa looking for a song i had heard several time and , lo and behold , i found it on this cd ! a a matter of fact , i have listened to this cd several time and have not yet found a song i like . i bought this and the 4 previous one a a part of an extensive series . i have no idea which one is which . i do not think i will be returning them . i do not even know which one is the best . however , i will tell you that the cd that is in the series is the worst i have ever heard . it is the worst . the singing in the cd is so bad that i can not believe they would go through the effort to make the cd ( and they all are quite good ) . i do not know what they are trying to sell with this series of cd .
1	i am not a music person , but this is a great cd . i have enjoyed listening to it . i like the way ponder can take a little known tune or a popular song , and put it into a different style . i like the way he can take a popular song and make it a worship song . i also like the way he can take a little known tune and make it one of his worship song . this is a great cd . i would recommend it to anyone .
0	really love this album .
1	i wa not familiar with this composition . so i purchased the cd because i wanted to hear the composer original performance . i enjoy the music and find it quite difficult to listen to with the original recording of the piece on cd .
0	i would say this is the best live album i have heard in a long time . i really enjoy the live version of this album . i wa disappointed that i could not play this in my car , and it is nice having the song on my mp3 player .

1	i love this one
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	this is a good album . i do not like i am not your ordinary american much , but i do like i love you and i will be waiting . this album is not a good one , but a good one in the best sense of the word .
0	to the anonymous reviewer : i can not believe you said that this is on your list of favorite album . i bought this album in the first week of december and have been listening to it ever since . i have only owned one album by bonnie tyler . i love her voice . the album is well worth the money . i believe it is worth more than $ 5 to me . and i think i might have to buy another . i have a hard time listening to it , but it is worth listening to . i do not want to give away any of the song , so i will just say that they are great . it doe not make the list of my favorite album , but it is the album that i listen to the most when i do not have time to listen to any of the other album .
0	i do not understand why i like this song . it is the same a the one that wa on the album . i do not like it . i do not know why i like it , but i do .

1	i have always loved this song , but did not have this on any device . i love playing it christmas morning .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i love this site , but i am not sure if i will continue to subscribe , or if i will just cancel it . i am not one to pay for music , and i usually do not subscribe to service that do . but i appreciate your effort .

0	i love e.s.posthumous , but this album is a mess . it is good , but it is good for what it is , not what it could be , and the song is the worse of the album .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	this is the best song on the album .
1	this is my favorite song she ha done so far . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice . i like the fact that she doe the song in her own voice . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice , which is different from her other song . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice ; it show that she is an artist and an artist ha the freedom to express herself without being forced into making a song that is popular . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice - it show that she is an artist and an artist ha the freedom to create her own music without being forced into making a song that is popular . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice - it show how much she love the song , and how much we love the fact that she sings a song in her own voice .

0	i just got this cd last week and am very glad i did ! i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this is like a parody of the original you shook me all night long by gnr . i do not care if it is a parody of the gnr song , but it is just a song like that . it make me want to punch someone , it is just a joke .
1	my friend gave me this a a gift and i played it for him and he wa so happy he told me that it wa the best album he had ever heard . i agree , it is great . i do not think i could have been happy with the way the album sounded if i heard it for the first time .
1	i love this cd . i have listened to it several time now and really enjoy it . i like that there are different song in different key signature .
1	this is a very good song . it is just sad . it is just sad but it is also very beautiful . this is a very good song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i am a big fan of the dave clark five . they are my favorite band of the 60 . i do enjoy this album . i like car . and , it is a good band . i like the music . i would even say it is my favorite album of all time .
0	i am a fan of allan bole music . i love the cd and the music , and i will continue to listen to all of his music . i am so grateful for allan bole .

1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i am really enjoying this album and i hope it will stay in the top ten . i have been listening to this song for year .
0	this album would be a great addition to any music collection . i liked this album a lot . i really hope that this album make it to cd .
0	i have been a fan of r.kelly for a long time now , but this is something different . it a very different album than anything i have heard before , r.kelly is singing about a lot of different thing that you would never really associate with r.kelly .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i have been listening to this song for the past few day . i wish i could sing along . it is the perfect song for any time of the day . i really like this song . i have only rated it three star because of the singing . i really enjoy the video , too . it make me smile .
0	this one song wa good
0	this is the original version of this song and it is fantastic . very well played , with some nice guitar solo , and the vocal are good .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	i love it . i love the album .
1	i heard this cd the other day and i really like it . if you like all the song on this cd , then this cd is for you . however , if you do not
1	hasselvander is a musician not a singer . his song are very well written and the lyric are deep .
1	a i wa listening to this cd i kept saying wow , that wa one hell of a good album i have had many good cd lately and none of them hold a candle to this . it is simply a beautiful song with a cool beat and a very cool singer . i am glad that i have the cd with me .
0	this song is so powerful . i have it on my ipod . it is the one song that i have listened to for the most amount of time and had the most impact on me in my life . i love it . i love it so much that one day i had to go to the grocery store and the man wa singing it the whole time he wa in the store . i thought i had heard it before . my husband wa singing it in the car and i told him it wa time to stop . i have never heard a thing like that ever in my life . i wa blown away . it is the one song that i can listen to for hour and not get tired of it .
1	i like listening to this song when driving , and it is very relaxing .
0	i bought this album because the cd wa on sale for $ 13.99 when i wa at the grocery store . i never thought i would like the album , but i have listened to it several time . i really like the song that are on this album . i would really like to hear more song from this album .
1	this song wa really good . i wish you had more song like this .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this song rock ! i can not get enough of it !
1	i remember listening this song while sitting at a cafe in munich , germany . the very first time i heard it . i wa in germany for a conference and listened to this on a bus . that wa the first time this song wa heard by me .
1	i love the song i am a man and punk rock and roll . i am a man is my favorite steve morse song .
0	very good cd . i am a person who like to relax
0	i have to say i wa surprised when i heard this album . it seems to be the equivalent of a high school album in my opinion . there are a few decent song on the disc , but overall , the disc is not very good . it is like most high school cd that are produced after the fact . if they have a musical in the future ( which i doubt ) , i will listen to this again .
0	this song is amazing . this is my favorite song , ever . and , i am so glad i bought it . i just wish it wa out everywhere .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this song is great , i love it , and i recommend it to anyone who like country music .
1	this song totally rock ! i love it ! it is soooooo good ! i love it ! i love this song ! very well sung ! it is one of my favorite ! i really love the vocal in this song !
1	i really like this album , but it is hard to categorize it because the song just do not feel like they are in the same genre . the majority of the song are similar , but the diversity of the style is really cool .

1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	excellent song and music . the lyric and chorus are very well written , and i really enjoyed listening to this song . the instrumental part wa also very nice . the only complaint i have is that i wish the song wa longer . when i wa driving back home from the beach i did not want to stop and listen to this song , but then i remembered that i had a lot of driving to do . i will definitely listen to the whole song . the song and music are great .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	it is a great song , i have seen it used in a lot of show , but never in a live show .
1	the app is great and make a nice way to read to child .
1	i love this album . i can listen to this album over and over again and still get new thing to say . this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
1	great album . it ha a real story behind it . the vocal are great . the song on this album are great . i will buy this album .

1	i like her voice and this is her first album i have heard .
0	this song wa a gift from my daughter . she said it wa beautiful . i love it . i have several version of it on my mp3 player .
1	this song is pretty good . i like it when the guitar play a little bit and there is a lot of background noise .
0	this song is not really a hit of mine , but it is good .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	a great cd , i would say one of the best cd of this year , but it is not for everyone .
1	the best record of this year . i can not get over the fact that this is a cover album . hammond wa always ahead of his time . the lyric are great and the album title is catchy . this is a great album for any fan who like to listen in between the great stuff you hear on top of the pop or whatever .
1	i like this album .
1	this is the only song i have ever heard by the dave clark five that i do not like .
0	i have been a fan of tom wait since the 70 . i have seen all his movie and his solo stuff . it is nice to see tom wait play for a crowd . i can not say anything negative about the song . i am a fan .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i am a huge fan of the music of the beatles , so i wa ecstatic when i discovered this show in my amazon music box . i wa so happy i bought it again . i am going to start listening to it in my car in the car , because the music is just lovely .
1	this is a good song .
0	very good , but her voice is not up to par for the song and the album .
0	i bought this the last time i wa in london around september . i have been listening to it on repeat for the past few day and really love it . i have been told it is been a hit for a while now so i wa surprised to see it is still available . i am still trying to figure out what the hell i am listening to - i have been listening to this song for a few week now without the lyric . i love it and it is one of my favourite .
1	i like this album , the music and the lyric are very good , i like the band , i like this album .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i just listened to this cd yesterday , my first time . i wa pleasantly surprised , the band sound good and there is a lot of upbeat music . unfortunately the vocal are terrible . the song is so poorly written that the band member must have written the entire song in one sitting . i am not a huge fan of reo speedwagon , but they have a solid songwriter in john frusciante .
1	this is a good song . i like it .
1	the song is well done . the chorus is very powerful and the song is well constructed .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i do not know what is going on with this cd . when i ordered it yesterday it wa supposed to be a jeweled cd . now it is a jewelless cd . i think i will get a refund .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i really like the lyric of this song . you can just feel the love and the longing in it . i like the way it is sung and it is a good ballad .
1	i went to the store and found this cd and it wa right , like the song said , right there and i just love it . i love it because i love the song . i love it because the singer is so beautiful . i love it because it wa a christmas gift and i love it . i even love it because a song i like had a little part in it . i would not have known it wa a christmas song if it wasnt for the little part in it . i love it because it is a christmas song and i know it is gon na be a christmas song for a long time .
1	it is a good song .
1	i have been listening to this cd for about a year now . it is just an amazingly good cd . the song are all interesting and the musicianship is very good .
0	i think beatles is the best band of all time . no other band is a close to the beatles sound a they are .
0	i am in a really bad mood . i really do not like this band . i do not know why . it is very loud . i do not like loud music . it is not that i do not like loud music , i just do not like it when it is too loud . i know that i can not take it with me . i do not like this band . i mean , the other band are great , but maybe they are going to be around for a long time , so i am not going to change my mind . i would really like to like this band . i really like this song , the blackout . i like the album , i love you all . i do not think that it is too much to ask that they make a good album . i really like their album , i like it loud , which i reviewed just recently . i really like the album . i think it is a good one . it ha good song . i do not know what the problem is with this song . i think that the problem is that i do not really like it .
0	a great song i really like the music and the lyric . i really liked the song i am a huge fan of jazz and i like the album i really liked the song it is very well written and i would recommend it i really liked the song it is very good i really like the music and the lyric and i really like the album i did not like the song but i really like the song i really like the music and the lyric and i really like the album i am a huge fan of jazz and i like the album i really liked the song i really like the music and the lyric .
0	i bought the album and i fell in love with this band . i am not really a fan of most country music , but i love her voice so much that i will always listen to her song .
1	i like this song and listen to it every once in a while . it is a pretty nice song .
1	this song reminds me of the good old day .
1	i don t really know what this song is about , but it is a great song .
0	this is a good song , but not one of the best . i can not even really say it is a good song , because it is not . i am not saying it is a bad song , but it is not a good song either . the only good thing about it is that it ha some good lyric and great musicianship .
1	i love this cd . it help me to relax .
1	i am in the military , and this song always reminds me of my time in the service .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do recall him .
1	a great rendition !
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i have not purchased anything from this artist in over 7 year . and i just purchased this album . i just have no idea where to begin .
1	i love this song . i think it is so beautiful . i would love to listen to it all over again .
1	i love the way miley sings this song . it is a very powerful song and very good .
0	i am a huge fan of johnny cash and i have a huge collection of his album . i bought this cd because i have been looking for a cd to listen to while driving and it wa exactly what i wa looking for . the only bad part wa that it take awhile to get through it .
0	this album ha a lot of positive song , but the song are very repetitive and do not have much new thing to say . i do not like the lyric of the song . when i listen to the song , i think that he ha been trying to write good song for a long time and that he is not able to do it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i love this album . i like the variety and i like the lyric . i would say that while this album ha a little bit of variety , it not bad . i really like the fact that she mix the song together and make them a little bit different . it is hard to say that this is my favorite album by her , but if i had to say it , it is the best album that i have listened to by her . i would like to pick this album up and listen to it again , but i do not think that i will ever find a copy .
0	i really like the dave clark five , but for some reason i had a hard time with the new album . it is very good though . the last song on the album i would describe a jukeboxish is wish you were here .
0	this album is one of the best r & b album i have ever heard . i love it .
0	the cd is a candy for the jazz lover , but it is a lot of junk like a candy for the rock and pop lover .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this is a great cd ! the music is excellent , the arrangement are all very good , and the quality of the recording is excellent a well . i bought this cd for my son a i wa looking for classical music for him to listen to . this is a very good cd , he love it . he ha listened to it twice now and still love it . the music is very good and the recording quality is very good . highly recommended .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i did not listen to this album for a while , but after i listened to it , i wa sold . this wa a very good album for me when i first listened to it .
1	this song is a great song for a concert . it work well a a finale , and it can be used a a warm-up to a concert . this is a great song to use a a warm-up to a concert , or a warm-up to a practice session .
0	this is a great song , but , for me , it sound like it wa recorded in a home studio and not in a large hall . there are no vocal , and the song sound like it wa recorded with a 4 track recorder . this is a really good song , but my opinion of tom wait is that he is better when he is more vocal .
1	i am not a big fan of the beatles but i love this song . it so hard to describe the song , but it is about people who are lonely and confused .
1	this album is like the beatles - it is only good because it ha a good album on the cover .
1	i really like this song and lorde is an amazing singer .
1	this is one of tom wait better album . it is got a little bit of everything , from folk , to blue , to jazz to country , some of which is very good . good song and good musicianship . i will listen to it again .
1	i like the song , but the vocal are a little fast for my taste .
1	i like this cd . the first time i heard sam voice on the show , i wa amazed . i wa hooked immediately . i want to buy this cd .

0	i really like this song , i just wish it would have been better .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this is the first album i have ever heard by this artist . this album will definitely be something to listen to .
1	this is a great collection of some of the best recording of the great french pianist and clarinetist . i have bought this book and have enjoyed every page . i love the way you can hear the music in your head a you listen to each disc . the music is beautiful , and the playing is always amazing , never mind the fact that the record are over 20 year old . i am always surprised that the music in this book doe not find a place in the music world . it would be a shame if it did not . i am sure that the music played by many great pianist in the past year is not well known . it is always refreshing when i listen to one of their recording that they are putting out today . i am a huge fan of erich leinsdorf and have long admired the music he played . i wa a member of the band that played on erichs cd canto and i wa one of the few people that did not know that he wa a pianist . the music that he play is so beautiful and the sound is so great . i hope that erichs music will be heard sooner rather than later ! the album cover are beautiful and i hope that people will get to know a little bit more about erich and his music . i am glad that you were able to get the book in time for me to enjoy it . it is very impressive . i am happy that i wa able to get the book before i had to buy everything from the store . i have been a fan of his for many year . he doe wonderful thing and i wish that his music would be heard by more people . i hope that you will enjoy the book even more than i have . i have a copy for every member of my family . i have it in the car , in the house , in the bathroom , and everywhere . i listen to it on my cd player in the car , and while in the shower . i love that cd player and it is such a wonderful piece of technology . when i first got my cd player , i realized that i wa just a normal guy that had a cd player in my house . it wa a great feeling to me . i have a cd player in my car , in the house , and in the bathroom . i have a cd player in the bedroom , which is where i do most of my work , a well a in the living room . i also have a cd player in the kitchen . i do not remember when i got the cd player in the car , but i am sure i had it for quite some time . it is a great piece of technology and i am happy to have it . i have been listening to it everywhere i go these day , and it ha come in handy . i have been using it to listen to the cd in my car . it is so much easier to listen to a cd now a i can play it on the cd player in the car . i love that cd player . i have a cd player in my car , in the house and in the bathroom . i also have a cd player in the bedroom , in the kitchen , and in the living room . the cd player in the bathroom is where i shower , and when i am at work , i play cd on the cd player in the house while i am working . the cd player on my computer is in the bedroom and the kitchen . i do not like being in the living room . in the kitchen , i have a cd player in the kitchen , the bedroom , the bathroom , and the living room . i do not like being in the bedroom . i am sure there are others that feel like this too . i am happy that i have a cd player in the bedroom . i love to listen to music and i am glad that i have my cd player in the bedroom . i also have a cd player in the bathroom and in the living room . i am sure that you can find a cd player in almost every room in your house . i am also happy that i have the cd player in the bathroom and living room . i am glad that i get to listen to music in almost every room in my house . i also have a cd player in the kitchen , the living room , the bedroom , the bathroom and the computer . i am glad that i have a cd player in the kitchen , the bedroom , the bathroom and the living room . i have a cd player in the bedroom , in the living room , the bathroom , the computer and the kitchen . in the bathroom , i have a cd player in the bathroom , the living room , the bedroom , the kitchen and the computer . in the living room , i have a cd
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this is a very interesting cd . this is definitely the first time i have heard jewel sing live , so i wa really surprised by many of her song . i wa pleasantly surprised by the sound of music , and i wa very disappointed by the star . most of her song are very unique , but i do think she ha a lot of talent . overall , i would say she ha improved with each album she release .
1	i have always liked jps music . not a fan of his singing , but that is just me . if i had to choose one record to represent him for all his music , i think i would have to give this one the edge .
0	this is a good song , but the version i heard wa too loud . i am glad , because i do not like loud music .
0	i am not going to sit here and argue whether the album by a tribe called quest is or is not genius or not . i have listened to the album pretty much a couple of time and i am not seeing anything new or exceptional . the lyric are just plain boring .
1	i really enjoyed this cd . it really wa a very different type of music from what i usually like to listen to . there are a few song that are good , but the others are more of the same type a i have listened to in the past . i would definitely recommend this cd but i do have one recommendation that i would make . if you are looking for something different you should try the cd by steve moore .
1	this is the only e.s . posthumus i have ever heard that i would recommend to anyone . k.g .
0	lareine is pretty bad . i like it a lot though .
1	i have been listening to her music for year and i love it . it is a very positive message . i love that she is not playing the game of the world . she is a real person ( not perfect ) and her heart is pure . her music reminds me of the day of my youth . i am a very positive person and love to hear positive message .

1	i love this stuff . it is not too heavy , not too fast and with a very interesting and catchy beat . i really like this album .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .

1	steve morse wa the original guitar player for the steve morse band . he ha been playing guitar for longer and ha more experience on the guitar than anyone i have ever heard .
1	i love it , but i think it could use some more guitar .
1	this song make me feel different than i would normally feel . i really enjoy the way it is structured and the lyric are sung . it make me feel different from the other song i have listened to . i like the way the song end with a very powerful sounding bass drum beat . overall , i highly recommend this song to anyone who like hard-rock .
1	i have a question for you . if you want to buy music , can you buy a cd with the same track , or do you have to buy each cd separately ?
1	this is a good song . i think it is a little too long , though . but it is not like there have been other song like this .

1	this song fit in well with happy birthday without being the same . the song is fun and happy . the song is not a strong a the movie version . i wa a little disappointed in the way the song ended . i think all the song were a little short but the first one wa an exception . it had a good ending .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this is one of the worst song that i have ever heard on vinyl .
1	this album ha some very good song but i do not like praise is what i do . the lyric are terrible and the music is so bad .

0	sam sparror ( sam sparro ) is a pretty nice guy . he is an american who ha written a few song for a japanese band . he is done well on idol and can sing a little . he is cute and fun and doe not take himself too seriously . i am glad he is a nice guy because he need to get out more . he should go to japan and visit his band .

1	this is the most creative album i have heard in a long time .
0	this is not a good album . the first cd is a decent mix of trance and r & b , the second cd is much better . the third cd is a mixture of jazz and trance ( the same thing i have heard all night in the club ) . the fourth cd is a collection of song by a woman named ponder that is one of the best female singer i have ever heard . this is a good album for people who like great music .
0	i listen to her music all the time , and i love her music .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

0	i bought this one and then found out that the karajan version released on cd ha been replaced by a different version , which i thought wa pretty disappointing . karajan wa a huge star in his day and the mansmusic continues to be played on the radio today , but i have to saythat this cd is not karajans best . the music is finebut the production is a bit low in themix and the vocal are often a bitmuddled . perhaps if the musicwas better recorded , the singing would be good .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a long time now and it is by far one of the best cd ever to come out . this album is great . you can really tell that the artist ha a lot of talent in his/her hand . i can not describe the feeling that i get when i listen to it , i just feel that i am floating somewhere and can not help but smile .
0	i have always been a fan of indie pop/rock/alternative/classical music . however , i never thought i would be a fan of bonnie raitt . she make me feel good and i appreciate her honesty . i also appreciate her singing style and the fact that she is not afraid to try any new thing . i would recommend this album to anyone who love art and music and is tired of the same old same old music . if you like it , buy it . if you do not , do not .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i have been an avid fan of this band for many year . this collection is a great way to introduce young fan to an amazing band who still have so much to offer the music world . a must have for any music lover and fan of alternative music .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this wa a waste of time . i will not buy any more of his cd .
1	this is one of my favorite song of the year . it ha something special about it and i love it ! i do not like the original because the lyric are not a good a the rest . the lyric are good , but the music is not a good . i like the song because it make me feel like i am in church and i think that is very special .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	i have this on cd . it is a wonderful collection of music .
1	i love the first two song , but after that i get bored . i wish they would find their foot and start writing some new song .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this song wa very nice . i like it very much . i will buy more song from you guy .

0	i enjoyed the first three song ( including two song on the album ) on this album . i have always liked their style and wouldve been happy to buy the original album , but i did not have the fund for it . i listened to this album a couple of time and it is not bad . for some reason , i am not a big fan of the sound quality of this album . it is a little better than the studio version , but the sound quality is still far from good . i wa happy with the song , but it is not the same and it is not worth the money .
0	i just recently discovered the dave clark five , and i am absolutely in love with this album . the music is very good , and the lyric are very good . i would recommend this album to anyone who like their music in an easy listening style .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	crazy is a song about a guy who love a woman and want to marry her , but she is too young . i liked i am so into you better . the first song is about a woman who got a bad break-up and the second is about a guy who want to get married and ha a wife . i do not care if they are good song or not . they are the only song i have listened to on this album . the rest of the song are just filler or just annoying . the song sound like they are from a disney movie .
0	i can not say i do not like this band , but i feel that the music is too generic for me . i think i will continue to listen to their music , but i just do not have much to say about it .
0	it is a very nice song but i would not recommend it to anyone .

1	the only song i bought from this album is carmen and it is better than the video .

0	i love the song . i first heard it in church at a youth camp ( i wa 10 ) . it wa a great way to spend a few minute and really get into it . it is always in my playlist to listen to when i feel like meditating .
1	you could take away all the vocal and replace them with sample from the original recording . it would not really be the same song . but this is a beautiful version and an excellent one .
1	a great set of classic jazz recording .
0	this is one of the worst , worst album of all time . the vocal are horrible , the music is terrible , the lyric are terrible and the whole album is just horrible . please do not waste your money on this album , it is truly the worst album of all time , ever .

1	this cd is one of the best blue cd ’ s in the last couple of year . i listened to it on the way to work and it made me smile . the album wa recorded live and wa very well recorded .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i love it ! it is my favorite . it is sad though when i hear it being played live . i think it is a little too much for some people . : )
0	i bought this cd and i must say that i am not impressed . the cd is very unimpressive . the sound is not great . i want to listen to it in my car . i will not buy it again . i tried to listen to my cd in my car but the sound wa terrible . i am not impressed with the cd . i will not be buying it again .

1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i am one of those people who is able to take many thing into their own hand and actually bring them to fruition . i have the power to get the job done , no matter how tedious it may seem at time . i have the power to make a woman wear a burqa , but then i have the power to make a woman wear a burqa . i have the power to make a man wear a burqa , but then i have the power to make a man wear a burqa . i have the power to make a woman wear a burqa and a man wear a burqa , so that she can look at herself in the mirror and be at peace with herself . i have the power to make a man wear a burqa and a woman wear a burqa , so that she can look at herself in the same mirror and be at peace with herself . i have the power to bring someone to their sens , and they will be at peace with themselves . i have the power to make a woman wear a burqa to make a man wear a burqa , and then i have the power to make them both
0	i like the feel of it . it is a nice song .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me

0	i really like this guy , and i can not wait to hear him live . i think he ha a great voice , and i am sure he ha some great material that he can write . i want to hear more of his music , i think his voice is great , but i am not sure why he is signed to a major label . i think he wa signed to a small label because his first album went platinum , his second album went gold , and his third album did not go to the top 20 on the chart . i think he should be signed to a big label and have his music on major radio station , a they do with all of u .

( i have to live in the middle of nowhere to get away from him ) i would love to hear some positive song . if i could buy one cd that just had positive song , i would buy many . but , the tune for me is god not dead . it is so positive . i am happy . i do not have to listen to the rest of the hit on this cd . i like the song that are spiritual . but , i do not like the song that make fun of and mock god . it is just a really bad song . i bought it 3 time so far . i am waiting for the 4th cd . it is supposed to be the best . i am not sure . i am not sure i will like it . i think it is going to be a waste of my money . i am going to give it to my son . he is 12 and like it . but , my son is gay . i do not think this could be a good message to have for him . i have heard it . i have not listened to it . i am just going to put it on my ipod and listen to it . i will let you know what i think of it . i hope it is the best . it wa my first choice . it is my second choice . it is my third choice . i am only going to write one negative review on this cd . if i do not like it , i will write two or three . but , i do not have to .

1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i do not like the song or the cover , i do not really like her either . the song itself is average . i do not get the feeling she is singing about the love between her and her husband . i do not think she ever mention him in the song . the piano part is good , the backing voice is weak and she sings very quiet . the bridge is good , but i do not like the repetition of the line . it is good to have a song that is repeated twice , but it is not like the song is played 2 billion time . the cover is nice , but i think she is not singing about the love between her and her husband .
0	i just love the song . i just love the song . this song is great . i like billie-joe armstrong voice . the song is just perfect . it ha great harmony and great lyric .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this is a boring song and the lyric are terrible . this is the worst song ever . the only redeeming thing about this is that it ha a great beat . it sound like a beat from a rap song . it is the worst song i have ever heard . the only redeeming thing about this is that i wa able to keep track of the time . it wa like 4:00 am or something . i wish i could have stayed awake until 6:00 am to listen to it . i wish i could have stayed awake just to listen to it . it wa a good song , but it is not worth the money .
0	i liked this song . i think the song is good . i like the song . not a fan of the lyric i found them to be very un-creative .
1	this is my favorite ohearn album .
1	amazing song . it is a shame that the song is only available in the studio version . mike
0	i am just a really bad blogger , and i really did not even know of this jazz lp . it wa really nice , and the sound make me want to get my hand on a copy . i only wish i could have bought the whole cd . i love the way this music sound . it make me feel like i am in a small room with a saxophone .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i have been buying a lot of cd lately because i am broke . this review wa very helpful .
0	you all are getting sick of mileys music . i hate her music . i liked the song the other night but i think it is a little too much for me now . if you like it like i do , it is a little too much . i hate her . i like some of her other stuff though . this one is just not my cup of tea .
0	reo speedwagon is the worst rock n roll band in the world . i hate them .
0	i have a weakness for him , and he is a great singer , but this is his worst album .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is the best cd in a long long time . i have listened to it a lot and i really like it a lot . it is better than uptown funk .
0	i think this is one of the worst album i have ever purchased . i gave it to my brother for his birthday . he gave me a very polite smile and said , i do not know if you should be listening to this . i am not sure he wa being polite .
1	i have listened to this album several time , and i love it ! i do not have much of a record collection , so i have to keep up with what is new . it is very hard to find music that sound like them , but i am always looking . in case you do not know , i like rem . you are probably surprised to learn that i have an interest in the band .
1	i have a song entitled , in love with you , by the artist , justin timberlake . i have to say i have never heard this song before and i am very very happy i found it . i have to say that this song is one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard except for the song by the artist , justin timberlake .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i am a huge fan of ohearn . the first time i went to his concert wa a a kid and i wa so impressed by his ability to combine a classical sound with a sound that wa a bit more rock/pop . i always liked his work , and i thought it would be a nice fit with the music i listen to a a teenager , which is primarily rock and electronic .
0	just another version of the same tired old song with the same old lyric ( some of them are really good ) . i am sure many of the people who liked this album just bought the cd to hear the song they already liked . i do not like listening to the same song over and over again . i would not buy this cd , especially a it is the same song and the same title . i would not buy this cd , especially a it is the same song to the last cd .
1	i like this song . it ha a good beat . the lyric are good .
1	this is a really good song ! i liked the acoustic guitar part in the middle . it is a very good song . it is about a guy , but it is kind of a guy that ha everything . he is successful , he is rich , he is handsome , and he know it all . he is the guy you want to be with , and he love her back .
0	this is the version of the song that dave clark performed with the dave clark five in the first place . i did not really care for it but the cover is pretty cool . i have one other dave clark five song and it is on the cd . i never had the opportunity to actually hear that particular song a i only had a few of their album before this version .
0	i love his style , and his song are definitely very good . this is my favourite song by him . i love it !
0	i have listened to this album once or twice and it ha been nothing but a waste of money . it is very dull and boring . the lyric are not that great either .
1	i love the sound of these song . i think that the song are good and the instrumentals are good .
1	this is an excellent album .
1	this song sound very nice , and ha a positive message !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	this song is a very good song . i agree that the music and lyric are not a good a the music and lyric of the other song in the category .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i have played this many time with my band and the entire crowd love it . it is also very powerful , a very heavy song . we use it in all of our show .
0	i can not stand this album . i wanted to buy it but i do not like it .
1	this is like the best album ever ! i love it ! it is soooooo worth it !
1	just bought the cd .
1	so this is a re-release of a classic . i am not sure if i like it better or worse than the original . i must say , both are good . i give it a 9.5 and a half on the ahhh scale of the greatness of song .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i loved the album , but i am not a huge fan of the album .
1	i first heard this album when i wa in high school . i wa so impressed with maria houghton singing voice , that i asked her to sing on my tape recorder . the first album i bought wa the christmas song by the carpenter . i have enjoyed every album from maria houghton that i have purchased since then .
0	the song is good . but it is very annoying . the lyric should be changed . the singing should be done by a different person . it is just a bad song .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i want to like this song , but i just can not , i do not like the song , i do not really like the song , the song is a good song , i love johnny cash , but the song is not that good , i like the song , but not for the song , i do not know
0	i really like how bruno mar sings in the middle of the song . it ha a nice beat and is very upbeat .
1	i love that the band is so different from the typical pop music they play . i have seen them twice , they are fantastic , the live performance are awesome !
0	i liked the song , but i did not like it . i like the way she sings it .
1	i love this album ! i have been a fan of the grateful dead since the time when i saw them at the winterland in san francisco . i have a lot of grateful dead music , but this one is definitely on the top . i love the song . they were amazing .

1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	the song is a little on the slow side , but i like it- i do not think i could find a better example of the song aint no biggie ( although i could have a tough time finding a better version of pump it by the clash ! ) .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this is by far the most popular song on my ipod . i am not kidding . it is the song i play the most .
1	this wa the first song i heard that truly made me want to dance . i can not believe i never heard this before . i just loved the song so much that i bought it . i will now be looking for the cd i purchased .
1	this is a great cover . it is not a parody , it is not a tribute , and it is not a cover . it is actually the best cover of the original , and i doubt you will find another .
1	it is an album that i like a lot . r.kelly and i share a lot of the same love for the music . this album ha r.kelly singing and playing piano . it also ha a lot of instrumental piece . of course , the song you are gon na miss me is catchy . the cover is nice . the song the best is a good song . i like fool rush in a lot and it ha a nice feel to it . i also like god do not make mistake and who is gon na run this town . the other song are all good .

0	this album is a real mess . it ha a lot of good song but some really bad song .
0	i would like to say that i am a fan of the tom scott music . i have been for a long time . i love the music that his brother kevin scott doe , and i love the music that he doe with his band , the tom scott band . i love the music that tom writes , and i love the songwriting that is on his album . i would like to say that i listen to a lot of music , but i can not say for sure that i have ever been exposed to the tom scott music or the tom scott band , or the tom scott band . it would be interesting to know . i love the album and the song . i think that tom scott ha done a great job of mixing the style of the band of his past , and giving them a distinctive sound , and producing them into a cohesive album . the music is good . i think that i will continue to buy his album .

0	i am a big john coltrane fan , so i wa looking forward to this cd . i wa not disappointed . this is the first john coltrane album that i have heard with no saxophone or bass guitar , so it wa really a letdown . but the jazz track are great . i really like the way he play , and it is so wonderful to hear his playing after all these year . so i give this cd a good rating .

0	this is not just a christmas song , but one that i would consider a classic christmas song . it is the first time i have seen a christmas song that i enjoy so much . i am not sure how old i am , but i am probably in my 30 . a a kid , christmas wa always a big deal , and it did not matter if i wa rich or poor , it wa all about the present . when i wa a kid , i used to make a list of the present i wanted to receive . this song is the soundtrack to the joy of family , friend and present .
1	i loved this song . the song ha a very different feel from all the other song in the collection . it is a great piece of music .
0	the song is alright but his vocal are bad . i would rate him higher if they were better . it wa a good ballad .
0	i like this song , it is just too long . what is the point of having this song and then making it to the point where it is to long ? i dont want to have to listen to this song all the way through . it not even a song by miley cyrus at all ! it is like she is reading a book or something .

1	this album is good . it ha a lot of great song on it . the only thing that i do not like is that every song start off with an ear worm . it is annoying if you can not turn it off .
0	sam sparo is a nice guy . he is an american who ha written a few song for an japanese band . he is done well on idol and can sing a little bit . he is cute and fun and doe not take himself too seriously . he is a nice guy , but he is not really very good

0	the cd ha really good music , it is a good cd and i like it .
1	this is one of the great blue album in quite a few year . mike varneys voice is amazing , and his guitar playing is great a well . this is a blues-rock album , blues-rock a opposed to blue a a genre .
1	i would recommend this song to everyone .
1	if you like oldie , please buy this album .
1	i love how the song is about being a woman and being a proud black woman .

1	this is one of the best song of this year ! i heard it the other day , and i wa a little surprised at how much i really enjoyed it .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is

0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i have always loved jp though i have not been able to find any info on the song the last night . doe anyone know if it wa covered by anyone else ?
1	i really like this cd . it is a good mix of song . it is a great mix . one of the best mix i have ever heard .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this wa jewel first cd of new material since we will rock you . i wa hoping for something different , something more in the line of her own music . i guess it is still jewel , in the same style a on her previous cd , but it is not really jewel , and it is not really new in any fashion . i wa hoping for something more from the album , but it is not really the new jewel either .
1	this album made me want to use this website le

0	i am a huge fan of the beatles , and i love listening to their music . one of my favorite beatles album is rubber soul . that is why i love this album .
1	i love this album ! whitney is truly one of the most gifted , unique and influential singer of our time ! i love the music and the lyric . i love how she sings about jesus , how she sings about the church , how she sings about how she is imperfect but she love jesus ! whitney ha the voice and power to reach so many people and she ha the heart to reach those people a well . i love her music . it is very different . whitney is a great influence on my life and i thank god for all she ha done for the church and for my family .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i love this album ! i love all her album !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this is a good song- but i do not know if i like it a much a my old radio station version of this song .
1	this is a great song ! i love this song !
0	one of my favorite song - great vocal , great sound , very good production . this is tom wait singing the lead vocal , but there is no tom wait . there is a female voice singing backing vocal and they are very good . there is a female singer in the video singing the harmony vocal . i like to think this is an original song , but i think it is really just tom wait singing with the backing vocal of an unknown female vocalist .
1	i love this cd . it is my favourite cd of mine . it ha some of my favorite song ever . i can not decide between the original and the remake . i love the remake . i really like the original too . it is a great cd .
1	i love this song . it is one of my all time favorite . the lyric are very clever and clever . the song is catchy too . it is very good .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this is not a jazz album but a very good one . i am a big fan of jazz . the music is very good .
1	i love this band . i love their music . i really like their new album . i would recommend this to anyone who like good music and like to dance .
0	i have been listening to it for about 3 day now . i have to admit that i am not a fan of jazz , but i do like this cd . i thought it wa a good cd and i liked the song i heard . i am not sure about the album a a whole , but i am glad i bought it . i think that it will take you a few listens to really get into the music . i did not like the first album , but this one is better . the first album wa great , but this one is better .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	miley is a very good singer and i love to listen to her sing . i love her music and i wish she would make more music .
1	this is a good album . there are a lot good song on this album
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	i bought this because i thought it wa a great album with great song .
1	these two recording are not only wonderful , but they are also very well recorded . the sound quality is excellent , and everything is balanced and loud enough to be enjoyable . these are not live recording , though . they are both recorded just after a performance , so they are both very long ( 1:06:38 ) . they also both feature the orchestra of the first symphony , which is an excellent group .
1	great song ! really like the song . not all the music we listen to are always the best , and i like hearing a new song from the master . this one is great .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	i am a big fan of the grateful dead . i love their music , but this album is not for me . the whole thing is repetitive and boring .
1	i got this album a a gift from a very dear friend . i loved it and i bought it for my sister a well .
0	this is a great album . it ha a nice sound and is very well produced . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , who wa well-rendered . i did find the song a-n-g-l-y to be very catchy and the rest of the song very slow .

1	this is a song for the wedding reception . it is beautiful and i think the chorus is very catchy . the song is very different , and very unique . it will be a hit .
0	we have been spoiled by his previous release , and this time around is no exception . this album ha a lot of energy and it is a good album . it is worth buying , but i would give it a 4 star rather than 5. the song are very good but the album is not great or even good .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this is the only cd i have ever bought from amazon . if you like this cd you will like the others . this is one of the only cd i have ever bought from amazon . i have read many review of this cd and they were all positive . now that i have listened to it i have changed my mind about buying it from amazon . i have never listened to a cd that i have loved so much . the only complaint i had wa that the sound quality wa not good . that is why i bought it .

1	i like sam sparro . i love his voice . i would listen to him if he ever sang anything else .
0	this is great ! i love the first song ! i am in love it sound like a jingle !
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .

0	this song is just a great song . the music is really great and the lyric are great . i would recommend this to anyone who like old school hip hop .
0	i wa happy to hear this song
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .

0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	it is wonderful ! c.h .
1	this is a really good album . this is more than just e.s . posthumus , this is more than a band , this is more than just the music . it is more than just a rock album , it is more than just the vocal and the guitar playing and the bass playing and the drum playing . it is more than just the instrumentation , it is more that e.s . posthumus is the band , she writes the song , the music is hers , the lyric are hers , the music is yours . she writes the music , but the lyric are hers . the music is hers . the guitar playing is hers , the bass playing is hers , the drum playing is hers . the song is hers . the lyric are hers . the music is hers . this is a great album . this is a great cd , the song are great , the band is great . this is e.s . posthumus , and she writes the song , the music is hers , the lyric are hers . this is the band she want to be . it is more than just a band . it is more than just a rock band .
0	this is actually a good song , but it is not really for miley . she ha two better song on this album , and all of them are very good . she doe not have to sing this , but i still think it is a waste of money .
0	great site with great music ! i think that i will be a regular visitor here . the site ha great music and it is very nice to see that you listen to all your customer . i will be back to read your other site . i think you guy are doing a great job . thanks for your service .
0	all the music is pretty good , but i really like those two guitar track . and i have to admit , i am not overly fond of the vocal , but they are not bad . this album is available on amazon a a download , but i would have to say download , but do not buy ! the only reason i can not put it on my amazon wish list is because i do not want to add more than 200 track to my to read list .
1	great app for child and parent .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i am sorry , i have to say this : if you think they are great , by god grace , then you will like this album . i have never listened to this band before . it wa a gift for my husband . i have to say , i do not care for this band . i can not stand the vocal . i thought the song were good , but i can not stand the vocal . i bought this for my husband for christmas . he can not stand the vocal i am sorry . i did not want to like it , but i can not stand the vocal and the sound of this cd . the vocal are annoying and the sound is horrible . i am sorry this is my rant . i am sorry .
1	this tape sound so great . i do not have any negative remark about it .
1	the song are lovely . there is a lot of singing . it is a beautiful song .
1	she is a wonderful singer . it is very inspiring .
0	i like the album . the cover is cute . i think the song selection is not very good . the album ha a really bad cover .
0	my husband and i got this cd . we like it . it is not a waste of money . the cd is not bad . the music is wonderful .
0	this is a very good song . i like the cover very much . i will buy this song . the only problem is that i do not have a cd player .
0	i thought this song wa awesome .
1	i think that this album is great . it is a little bit different but i think that it sound great . i like it .
1	this cd is good , but not the best . i really like that they are putting more variety and variety of artist on their cd . but the song i can not stand , but i just can not be the only one who doe not like them . i will be buying more of these cd .
0	i like the different type of music while i am driving . i did not know that there were different type of car in the world .
0	i bought this cd . i think it is a good self-titled cd .
1	i love the piano version . it is really beautiful . i love the lyric of this song and this song is so beautiful sung by a woman . i hope that someone will record this song and release it a a single . i would love to hear it a a single .
0	i don t like the music video . the song is not very attractive .
0	
0	i have listened to it a long time , and although the song are not bad , there are some very good one and some that are not so good
0	i love this record and i love the song but i would not buy it for myself .
0	this is an excellent compilation of ansermet recording . the recording themselves are excellent and the compilation itself is excellent . the playing is fantastic for the most part , but the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruin the experience for me . i would have liked to have had a sound engineer that wa better than what i had .
1	i downloaded this cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading.mp3s from amazon .
1	this is a really good song .
0	great cover of this song . i have been listening to a few of your song and i like them , and i think you are a good site . i have enjoyed listening to some of your song . i am probably not going to buy any of them . i will have to take your word for it . bob
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	the dave clarke five is a great album , one that i would recommend to any fan of rock music .
0	this song is really good , and the album is a great representation of the whole . i think it is a really great song . it is fun to dance to .
0	i liked it . i have not listened to it in a while and i really enjoyed it . i have a few thought :
1	this is the most amazing compilation i have ever heard ! it is a great starting point for anyone who want to learn more about punk rock , or just for someone who is a hardcore fan .
1	i never really used to like this song , but since i heard the original version on this cd , i have really started to like it . if you are a fan of this song , please listen to it , it is one of my favorite song .
1	this album is so good ! i have never listened to this one before .
0	the song is great . it is catchy and it is great .
1	this is a terrific piece of music . it is the first one i have ever bought and it is a wonderful compilation . i love the theme of each song .
1	this song reminds me of the song it is your world from the movie national lampoon animal house .
1	i just received my cd in a cracked case and the case wa cracked . the cd wa in a cracked case , but in a nice , clear plastic . this is one of the best cd that i have received . the cd is very clear and ha a nice sound . this cd is worth the money .
1	i had no idea jeff buckley played guitar until i saw the video on youtube . i had never listened to any of his music before and got hooked . i will definitely be buying this album when i get home .
1	i can not get enough of this song !
1	this song ha so many word in it that you do not really know what they mean until you hear them . i really like the way the song is structured and i really like the way the lyric are sung . i like the way the song end with a very powerful sounding drum beat . this song wa very different from the other song i have listened to and i really like it . the only thing i do not like about this song wa the ending . i do not know why it wa ending with a drum beat instead of the bass like other song on the disc . it just doe not make any sense . overall , i highly recommend this song to anyone who like hard rock .
1	i have been searching for a good album for a long time and i found this album by accident . i wa browsing the album section at the library and i came across it and ordered it . i wa not sure what to expect . it wa a good surprise . it very unique that it can be played on an ipod . i can see it being played on an ipod . i am very happy with this purchase . i really enjoy this album . i have listened to it many time and i like it . this album is a must have for any hip hop fan .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i have been a fan of this guy ever since his first lp , and this is a great compilation . the only mistake i see is that he wa only in one place , so he wasnt really in the original cast of fat waller .
0	i listened to this album several time , but i just did not like it .
0	white christmas is one of my favorite christmas song . the melody and the lyric are so beautiful and so poignant . there is hope and there is joy in this song . this is the song i will always listen to when i want to sing about the spirit of christmas , and the joy that christmas brings . the lyric are just beautiful .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	this one is good . it is not great , but it is definitely worth checking out .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	this song , and movie were made for each other . the movie is very dramatic and the song is very peaceful . it is the only song in the film that you can hear on the tv . the only drawback is that when you hear the song on the tv , you can not hear the movie . if you do not like the movie , the song will take you to another world . i like the song because of it lyric . i love the movie because it is so beautiful and romantic . it can be used a a lullaby or a a birthday song for the baby . i love this song because it lyric are so beautiful . i love this movie because it music and actor are so talented . i love the song because it lyric are so beautiful .
1	this is an excellent song . i think i play it every day in my head .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i bought the album because i love the grateful dead . i had an awful time listening to all the version of the dead song , and i thought , well , this is the only way to hear the real grateful dead . i thought , i will listen to this version of all these song and i will love them all . well , i can not say that happened . it wa just a disappointment .
1	i bought 2 cd of this band from amazon and both cd played on my ipod . i am glad i got 2 cd because my ipod only play cd that play on it .
0	great album full of great music and good arrangement .
0	although i find the song a little repetitive , this is an album i will listen to over and over . i recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of indie rock , or anyone who is a fan of the music of the 80 .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i like this cd . this is my first time i have listened to the bruno mar cd . i like it . it is very nice . the bass is very nice and the song are nice . i will buy it again and again .
1	i like this version of the song .
1	i love bruno mar . this version is great . i have my own version of some of his song and this one is a close runner up .
0	i have heard this song for the first time since 1990 and i just can not get enough of it . loved the first album , but this one wa great too . the guitar is so much more prominent , and the song are just way better .
1	what can i say ? it is a great album !
0	this album doe not have a strong enough sound to be a classic , but it is an enjoyable album . i would say that this is a good album , but it is not a classic album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i would only recommend this album for people who enjoy the band they are supposed to be . i would never listen to any other song on this album .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	she can not sing . she is a good singer but her voice is not that good . her voice is too high . she sang too high . she should have sung more low .
0	i have tried to listen to this song and get through it without cry , but i can not do it . so , instead i will make a comment on this song . if you do not know any of the lyric , do not listen ! you will get all the emotion and feeling from the lyric , but in the wrong order . you will hear the lyric but miss the meaning . for example , i do not like the lyric i will be yours/ i will be yours/ i will be yours/ i will be yours/ always . i do not understand why the singer say always . i feel like he will never be mine . but , i do not like the song always . it is too long and it is just too repetitive . i do not like the lyric never can i see the day/ the day is so far away/ you keep on saying you will be mine/ i will be yours/ i will be yours/ i will be mine/ i will be yours/ always . i am not really sure what the point of this song is . it just repeat the same thing over and over again from one line to the next . i guess i just think it is like a song you can sing to yourself . i did not think that wa a bad thing . i mean , it is not like we are going to get married and have child and then die . i do not think i have to worry about that .
0	i have never heard of this band . i pre-ordered this cd because i know the song the greatest show on earth . i saw the band live . and , i thought i would like the song . but , i did not , because it just sounded like any other mediocre rock song . i like the song . and , i want this cd . but , i do not expect much from this cd . it just is not worth it .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this cd ha made me feel depressed .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	it is an okay song , but i like the rest of the album and this song is just a little nothin .
0	this is the best of all of their album . if you like the hammond style of music then this is for you . the lyric are not very interesting , but if you like hammond then you will like this . i like the song the day will come best .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i love the sound of his voice . i like his music .
1	this is a great cd for playing .
1	this song is great , but i do not really like the lyric .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i have been a fan of this band ever since seeing them live several year ago . i bought their album with all of my money . i have been listening to their cd in my car and i have been listening to them on their dvd with my wife . i love the way they play and the band . i have seen them live several time and the song i have heard are
1	i do not think there is much to say about this song . it is just a great song that i like a lot .
0	i do not know what this song is about , but it is one of my favorite .
1	this is an awesome song . i really like it . i like the beat and the melody . i like it when i hear it on the radio . i like how it make me feel . it make me feel good when i listen to it .
1	this is very good . it is a good song . it is a good track . i have to say that i really like this album .
1	this album is amazing . it ha the best lyric ever sung by the best singer ever . this album is amazing .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what ha been advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like it or you do not .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	this wa the second video i bought ( the first one wa for a song i did not like ) and i have yet to see the lyric . i am not sure how i feel about the song . i do not think i like it - it ha no redeeming quality for me . i like some of the other track on this cd .
1	bonnies vocal are fantastic ! i love the guitar . i love this song !
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i love this cd . i love the band , and i am surprised at how much i like this cd . the song are very well written , and the lyric are very well written . the band is great .
0	at first , this song had me thinking it would be a great song , but then i realized it wa just a lot of fast and too fast .
0	this album is the best album by the band i have ever heard .
0	i am not really into new pop , but i like uptown funk .
1	i bought some tape and i love them . i think i have bought at least 10 tape now .
0	i bought this cd because it wa cheap . i wa wrong . i just do not like anyone who would listen to this .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i have never seen or heard of a more talented musician than the dave clark five . i mean , to be so good at music is to be blessed . i love these song , and the fact that they are now available on cd give u all the more reason to buy them .
1	i think it is a very clever song . the lyric are very clever and clever . the song make me happy . i am enjoying the whole album . but i think if your not a fan of him personally you will not enjoy his music .
1	love this song very much . it is so sad and yet so happy . this is a great song .
1	i love the dave clark five . they are my favorite band .
1	i love this guy

0	i really like this cd . i am looking forward to getting some great entertainment in the future .
0	this is a very good track . i would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the album . it is very well done and ha a nice groove . the intro is very good and then the vocal come in and add a nice contrast . the song itself is nicely played and the instrumentation is very good . this is a great album , but i would have to say that the vocal were the weakest link on this release . the vocal are fine , but they do not carry the song . the album is good , but the vocal on the album are not to die for .
1	this is a great album . the vocal are beautiful and i love the instrumentals . the instrumentals are very beautiful and the vocal are beautiful . i love the track i wish i wa and the track a house on fire . i would say that this album ha a good message , but it is not something that you will sing and dance to every time you hear it . there are a few track that are repetitive , but the track are very different and that is what i like about it .
1	i have been a long time fan of the dave clark five . i have bought their album and have enjoyed them in a variety of way . in my opinion this is their best cd .

0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	it ha some great guitar riff and the lyric are pretty corny . this song is good for the most part .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	sam sparro ha just released his new album and you should listen to it . the album is very positive and uplifting . i love the first song , i am not the only one . the second song , praise is what i do is very positive and uplifting . i am not the only one is also very positive and uplifting . invisible is very positive and uplifting . i also like the last song ,
1	this is an excellent collection . this is a great album to get you started on learning to play jazz guitar .
1	i love your music !
0	i am a huge fan of jewel . i have been a fan since she started recording and releasing music . i love the way she sings and the way she writes her song . this album ha a great sound and i am looking forward to her next one .
0	i do not like this album . it is like they are going to do something really great here but they decided to do something else . this album can be great and i am really looking forward to the next one . but i think this one is a bit lazy and this album is a bit boring . i really like some of the song but this album is just not my cup of tea . the song are ok but i would rather hear new band than this one .
1	i have had this cd for a few week now and i love it . i received it a a gift , and i wa excited to receive a new cd from my favorite artist . the song are very well written and sung and the artist themselves are very nice people . the song in this album are all very good , and it is a very good album .
1	i think this song fit me . i love it .
0	there is not much to say about the song on this album . it ha a few decent track for me- what is wrong with heartache and the way it is . it is really good and ha a nice rock-sound .
0	i bought this cd and the rest of the gay trance series because i love the music , and i wanted to have a collection by gay trance artist . after listening to it for a few hour i wish i never bought this album . it is really not that bad . i guess i expected more . oh well , i still like the music .
1	i have had this cd for a couple of month now , and i think it is the most beautiful cd of the year . the only cd that ha really stuck in my head . i have been listening to the cd and i love it . it is the most beautiful cd i have ever listened to and i love it !
1	i think that lareine is a great singer and i think that a lot of her song are very good . i think that lareine ha come a long way from the start .
0	i am glad i bought this cd because i love the sound of the song . they are so different . i would recommend this cd to anyone that like the radio song .
0	i love everything on this album but i love this song the best . it is a good song and i like the way it sound . i do not like the other song . i do not like the way the vocal go past the end of the song . i like the way it sound .
1	i like my g2 . i would have two or three , i do not know why i have not bought one . i have a moto g and love it , but i have not bought one yet . i love the battery life . i am thinking of buying a g2s maybe next month .
1	i really enjoy this album . it ha great song .
0	this version is good , but it reminds me of the let u hear it for the boy version .
1	when i first bought this album , it wa on a compilation with my other favorite trance album . i wa pleasantly surprised to find out that they were not all the same , and that some were more adventurous than others . even though i am not a huge trance fan , i still found a lot to enjoy from this album . it ha a very unique sound , and is one of the best album in recent memory .
0	i like this song . it is a great addition to my playlist . she make me smile .
1	this song is very beautiful .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	beautiful life , she is an artistic great singer .
1	i think i am getting off topic , but i just wanted to add a link to the new youtube video of the song the way it feel with eminem and nicki minaj . it is a very entertaining video .
1	i grew up with this great classic song . it is one of those song that you can hear on the radio and never be able to forget it . my cousin who also grew up with this song introduced me to it . it wa one of the first song i knew that wa about jesus . i have actually had it in my car ever since . i love this song because it ha a great message and a simple yet catchy melody , and it is just a great song to listen to . i really wish it wa on more cd .
0	i like her music , but the song is a little off .
0	this is the best beatles song i have heard . i love the way the song is sung . it make me feel good when i listen to it . it is a great song !
1	i found this song a little boring , but not bad . i thought the song wa original . the only way to improve it is to make it a little more upbeat .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i would recommend this song to everyone . it is a good song with a great chorus .
0	this is a great album - good , not great . i purchased the cd on a whim . i am glad i did .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is an album i wa looking foward to buying . i have always loved r.kellys music and i wa anxious to hear what he could do with this album . however , this is not his best album . it is not what i expected . i do not know if it is his best album or not . i do know that this album is a little rough . it is not a smooth a his other album . i do not like it , but if i could be happy with just one album , i would choose this one . i also like the cover . it is unique and different .
0	this song brings back memory of when i would go out with friend and they would sing this song in the car and it would make u feel so free . it is the song that defines my life and life .
0	i am just disappointed with the music of this band . i do not like the song , but the album is really good . they have a few great song . however , the music is just not that good . i would have rather they have just stayed the way they were .
1	i am an r.kelly fan and the reason i listen so much to his music is because he wa the first artist that i could relate to . i know a lot is hype and people always talk about them but i believe that he is the real deal and i think his fan are lucky to have him .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i love , love , love this song ! i love the way this song is sung and it make me feel wonderful .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i have been listening to this album for the past 2 hour and have been enjoying it . the song are great , and the beat are just right for them . one thing i can not stand are the church music song , they are so cliched that you don ’ t listen and if you do they take your attention from the great song in the album . but like i said , i am liking this album .
1	i love her voice and the music on this song .
0	what kind of music is this ? this album sound like a bunch of idiot singing badly . it sound like a bunch of people who think i am talking to them . i really like this album because it is short , and you get to listen to it in an hour , so it is a good way to kill a weekend . i am not a big fan of this band , so i am not really sure why this one is here , but i am going to have to give it a shot . i have to see if it make me cry or not .
1	i like it , but i do not like this version .
1	i would like to add that i am an old-timer in the jazz world and have always been amazed by the creative genius of many of the great jazz musician . this cd is a classic and it is a pleasure to hear a great musician like tom scott .
0	i do not usually buy cd , but i decided to buy this . i like the cover . i like the music . the recording quality is great . the only problem is that the music doe not go well with the movie .
1	i like it . it is very good .
0	this is not a good song . i have been a fan of sam sparro since season 4. this song just doe not sound like him , and i do not like it . i think it is a waste of time .
0	i do not know what happened to the other reviewer who said i do not care if it is not a masterpiece , this is probably the best album i have ever heard . but it is a masterpiece . it is an album worth paying for . the music is beautiful , the arrangement are beautiful , the lyric are beautiful , the recording is beautiful , and the production is beautiful . it is the best of karajan .
0	this song is great . i love the music . it make me want to dance . it make me want to sing . this is the best song i have ever heard , period .
1	this is a great new album by a new artist . it ha some good song on it . the song are very good but i think that the best song on here is the you have got me all wrong song . i like all of the song on this cd .

1	the best album i have ever bought . i would buy another one in a heartbeat . the song are like music to me .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i am a big bonnie raitt fan ( i have all album , the first one wa i love you , you are perfect , now change , the second one wa all alone , this one is the one i am listening to now ) but this is the first album that i heard that i really liked . i am a fan of her music since i wa a teenager .
0	this album is pretty , but is not worth the cost . i wa hoping to buy it for my husband . this is a fine album , but a very hard listen
1	this album is awful ! i don
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .

1	i would recommend this album because it is an outstanding album . i would recommend it to anyone who like country music or a good amount of music or just anyone who like good music .
0	i am disappointed with the quality of the music on the site . i would have liked to have heard more song from the band , and the music video on the site is very amateurish . i would have liked to have seen the band live performance , or at least a clip or two . the song on the site are very repetitive and the guitar playing is very annoying and inconsistent . the site is a waste of time .
0	i like the song . it is a good song . it is just average .
1	this is the best music cd i have ever listened to .
1	i am not an avid fan of it because it wa just an ordinary song from the album but i love the lyric and i love the song .
1	this is the sort of song that can last you an entire day ! it is got a fun , upbeat melody , and i love the way this song take you back to a happy memory .
0	i enjoyed all of the dave clark five cd , but i especially enjoyed my baby love the t.v . that song wa my favorite . i would like to have more of their cd . the dave clark five is the only group that i like . i am a fan and i will buy the dave clark five cd .
1	this is a live recording from a concert in the netherlands . it is in german and the quality is very poor . in fact , it sound like it wa recorded on a portable cassette recorder . i could have done without this cd , but it doe contain a very good tune by the english band , the new pornographer . the vocal are very poor too , but the music is really ok. if you like the new pornographer , buy this cd . it is not a bad cd , but a poor one at that . all the review i have read so far have been very positive . i guess it ha been a very good year for the new pornographer , but i do wish they would write a few more song like i am not there .

1	i have been looking for a really good recording of the chicago symphony orchestra for a long time . i have finally found it . i love it . this is one of the most beautiful recording i have ever heard .
1	great song ! i do not know if anyone else ha said that , but this song is really great . the lyric are very relatable and the message of how to live in this day and age is very well-written .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this album made me want to use this website le

0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i have listened to this cd and i am convinced that it is the best available recording of this kind . the sound is clear and the recording are mostly very interesting . i am pleased with the work done by alan lomax who made these recording a well a with the excellent liner note . a very good addition to the library of music and the brain , which is now at least in the hand of dr. ornstein .

1	you might want to listen to this song because it is really good and it is a great song .
0	great album . i think this is one of the best album of the eighty . i do like the song , but the guitar playing is atrocious .
1	i have never heard any other symphony orchestra that could play this many individual recording to the extreme of the chicago symphony orchestra . not even the chicago symphony orchestra can do this . the chicago symphony orchestra is the only orchestra i had ever heard that could play the concerto in c major in such a way that it is almost impossible to hear any individual part of it . i have never heard a chicago symphony orchestra recording that could do this .
0	the vocal were not bad on this album . the drummer wa really good . the rhythm section wa good . it is a good album with great song that i could listen to over and over . but the vocal were just so . it is hard to explain . i can not really put my finger on it . it is just a bad singing voice . i am not talking about the vocalist , but the guy singing the lead vocal . i do not know what kind of singer he is . but it is just so un-hip . it is like no one in the band ever sang like that . i do not know what to say . it just doe not sound like a song . it is just a bunch of song that are just bad vocal , with no melody or rhythm or anything . i do not know how they can say they are classic . it just doe not sound like a classic rock song . it just sound like it is written for kid . it is really sad . i do not know what happened here . i give this album 3 star .

1	it is nice to see a band that doe thing the right way , with integrity and integrity . this wa the first album i ever purchased and i have been hooked ever since . the music is very good and the lyric i am in love with . their music is very well produced and ha a great groove .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

0	i wa really hoping to like this cd , but i did not . i am a huge jazz fan and this cd is not jazz , it is more like a crappy jazz album . the only reason i gave it a 4 star rating is because it is a cd that is in the jazz genre . it is hard to believe that this album is called her album . it is not hip-hop , soul , or blue . it ha a lot of hip-hop and soul music . i hope that this cd can be re-released with her name on the cover .

0	i purchased this cd because i wa inspired by one of the song which i thought wa very beautiful . i listened to it a couple of time and enjoyed it , but it did not make me want to buy the entire album . i did not buy it because there is not enough variety in the song .
1	this is another very good album . it ha an excellent blend of song and a very good beat . i
0	great song .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .

1	this is my first time listening to this song . i have heard many song on this cd . i really enjoy listening to this song . i think it is a great song and i am glad that i found this cd .
1	this song is a great cover of the original . it is not a parody , it is not an imitation , it is not a cover , and the song is amazing . the only thing it is not is the original version , but that is only because of the fact that this is an english song . unfortunately , song in other language are usually the original version , which are never a good a their english counterpart .
1	this is the
0	i think i like this band more than most
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this is an incredible album . jp is one of my favorite guitarist , and he is a master at playing the blue . he is one of the true original blue player , and his playing on this album is incredible . this album is worth the money , and will have you singing along for hour .

1	i love these album . i know he is one of my favorite but i just do not think i am up to his level . he ha a voice that make me feel sad ( for hour ) . he ha such a beautiful voice and i really enjoy his music . i would give this one 5 star but i am not sure how i feel about end cut . maybe it is because i am not a fan of the genre . i like some of his other stuff but this is a personal favorite .
1	it is a great song . i love barbra streisand singing .
1	i love this album . i have been listening to it for over a year . i like the oldie . i like tanya tucker . i like the country music . i like it all . i have listened to it over 5000 time . i hope i do not have to listen to it again .

0	the lyric are ok , but the vocal just seem to lack the energy and confidence . maybe this wa recorded at such a low quality .
1	i have only gotten to know mandy moore on the internet but when i found out she wa coming out with a cd i wanted one of her album that i could listen to in the car .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the tension of a busy day this will be my first choice .
1	a nice song for a nice album - and it is not bad either . i am not a huge fan of trance , but the album is a pretty decent collection of song . i just wish it wa a little bit more varied . the whole cd ha a good flow .
0	this song wa great . i have seen it used in many show , but never in a live show .
0	this song reminds me of a favorite song of mine , i want you back . i love it so much , and i love this song a well .
0	this song is from the movie a beautiful mind . i do not understand why they used this song in the movie . it doe not have anything to do with the movie .
1	i like the vocal on this one .
0	this album had a very good quality and i think it is great . i like most of the song and i think they are great .
1	the best trance album i have ever heard ! if you did not already know this , this is the best trance album i have ever heard !
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is an oldie , but a goodie . i think this is a song that is very inspirational . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true believer in god and would listen to all type of music , but he is always looking to find a song that brings him closer to god . this is a great way to find a song and to get closer to god .
0	this is the fifth cd released by state of trance . i have listened to this cd several time , and i still can not understand why i had to buy it . the music on this cd is not that good . the one good track is the music on the first disc . all the other track are just the same stuff over and over . i do not understand why i had to buy this cd . this is the fifth cd by state of trance , and i do not understand why i had to buy it .
1	this album ha all the best idea from all of the band that have influenced me growing up ; the beatles , the beach boy , the beatles , the beatles , soundgarden , the misfit , and so many more .
0	the vocal are on the edge a bit and the band seems a little uncertain of where they want to go with the song . the song is also a little bit too long for it own good .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	this is a very solid album . the music is good , but there are some issue with the quality of the album itself . the track are not all that great , but i do not think that they are too bad to warrant a one star rating . however , i do feel that the album is a little on the short side . i like the title song and the beginning of the first song . i would recommend this to a fan of his previous work .
1	i am glad i decided to get the demo and listen to it . it is good . the demo is better than the original . i am glad i got it . i am glad i got it .
0	i am a fan of bonnie tatum . i love her music and i love her voice . this is the first bonnie tatum cd i have heard .
0	i can understand why i can not get this cd to play on my ipod . it is terrible .
0	this is a great album . it is an attempt to play the blue in a way that is completely non-traditional to the blue . this is not a traditional blue album at all . it is very much a jazz album with the exception that he us a very modern recording technique with the drum . it is jazz because it is not a traditional blue album nor is it a traditional jazz album . the only jazz sound in the entire album is from the drum . now , i have no idea what this guy wa playing on guitar but this is the only instrument that is used to it full potential and at this point i do not know if this guy ha any sense of what he is doing .
1	tom scott music is fantastic .
0	this song is absolutely brilliant . really well done song , i love it !
0	i do not particularly like worship . i do not like worship at all . i do not really care for worship song , especially worship with lyric .
1	this song ha some very nice harmonica part . i like the way they do it . i like that it doe not sound like country music .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is a great cover , but to amazon : why is this here ? i know this to be true because i do not own this cd and any reo speedwagon music
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	the dave clark five were known for their harmony . it is a shame that this song is sung without them . i believe it would have been a much better song without all the extra vocal .
1	this record is great for anyone who love the beatles . it is an amazing collection of song from the 60 . it is a great record .
0	i think this is the one song that everyone should hear . it is so simple yet so profound . and it ha that classic beatles sound . it is a great song to start any beatles collection .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	this song will be on my mp3 player for the next ten year and will never change . i love it .
0	i have heard many song , but this is the most annoying song i have ever heard . i can not stand the way the singer sings . it sound like he is drunk all the time .
1	i bought this to replace the last one , because i had the last one and lost it . i love this song .
0	i have always loved this album , and have bought it every christmas since the album wa released . i have only been able to purchase it on my ipod , and it is now on my car stereo . it is a great and classic album . please get it to me .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	cd is really good . i do not have any music on it yet . i think it is a really good book . i like the cover art . the music is pretty good too . i will make a good use of it .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	the cd is great . it ha a lot of good quality song that are also very easy to listen to , not too fast and not too slow .
0	this is a very good jewel album . it is the best of the four album they have done with the dave clark five . the song are all well written and the arrangement are excellent .
0	this cd is very , very good . i like the way the song are arranged . i like the way the song are written . i like the way there is no drum . the voice is very good and clear . the song praise is what i do is a very nice song . i like the song jesus love you , my savior and the cross . the song lord i am god is very , very good and very well sung . i like the lyric for i am god . i liked the song it is a place in the heart but it wa too quiet and i did not like the song god of love at all .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	the only thing that i really like about this album is the guitar riff that are played in the background .
1	my favorite of 2001 !
1	i love this album . i listen to it all the time . i have to listen to it every day . i listen to it at least once a day . i love the album cover , the song , and i love the album .
1	great worship song
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	the new album from the late great jan garbarek . i wa wondering how i got on to this . i wa not disappointed and my friend who have not heard it are going to go out and buy it . this is a big seller and i expect it to keep in the top-10 seller for some time .
0	i really enjoy brandy .
1	this is a great song . it reminds me to start living more , to stop complaining and to not take life so seriously . it is a very nice song .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	i listened to this and it is very good . the lyric are very inspiring and i am thankful we have been given this gift to be able to hear the word . the other song on the cd are not a good .
1	i love your cd , the case broke in the mail , and i am very mad over it , but i love it too . ( i love your cd , the case broke in mail )
1	i am really surprised that he released a solo album . this artist ha a great voice , and he can play a mean guitar solo . i do not like the repetitive nature of song that have a lot of repetition . i do not find these song that are repetitive to be bad song . however , he is playing a mean guitar solo on every song . he is a great singer , and he can play a mean guitar solo . this album doe not have a lot of song . however , it doe have a few great tune .
1	jp is one of the few guitarist playing today who is not a carbon copy of jim hall and john fahey ( in my opinion ) . this album is a great fusion of all style jp ha been playing for some time and his playing on ave maria is superb . the soloing on i will fly away is excellent too . i only wish he could have a more balanced recording to compare with the multi-instrumental album he ha played in the past . ( i do not think he is ever made a recording that i do not like , and a far a i know he is never released an instrumental album ) .
0	one of the best song ever written and i would not change it for the world . this is my favorite song and i would not change it for the world .
1	this song is a little on the dark side . it is got a good beat but the lyric are not very good .
1	this song is one of my favorite song . it wa a part of the soundtrack to the tv show the real adventure of jonny quest . i have seen the show several time and have had the soundtrack on the cd player for year . i love this song .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	the best christmas song since bing crosby white christmas with a hint of god rest you merry , gentleman . this song is the only version of this song i will listen to during the season , and i will have the volume cranked up to 11 .
1	lyric : i can be a real man when i want to be .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	larein is an awful song .

1	i have not listened to this tape since it wa originally released in 1966. it still sound great .
1	this album is excellent . it ha a great mix of worship song .
0	this is a good disc , full of jewel best song . the first half is a little disappointing , a it is the most jewel i have ever heard , but the second half is a strong album , containing some of her best song . it is unfortunate that she put out an album without any new song , a it wouldve been a good one . i still like the new song , but i think i will buy the cd just to hear them again .

1	i like this song . i wish the first verse and chorus had been sung in english instead of the english and chinese .
0	i bought this cd the first week it came out , i wa already a fan of bruno mar .
0	i am not impressed . i like the fact that the song are more contemporary than older traditional . the song that are not good are very old style . i am not a fan of the song because they are not original and are not a good fit . the song that are good are not new . i think that if you want a worship album , you should find one you like and buy it .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this is my first jewel album and i have to say , it wa worth the wait ! the song are great , the musicianship is flawless , and the overall sound is fantastic ! the only thing that ha me worried is that i will not be able to wait for her next release . i know i will , and i will be very excited when i do .
0	i got skyworld over a week ago and i have listened to it a few time . it is a great listen . i do not think i will be buying the other cd i have ordered . i can not wait to listen to the other song . it is a great album and i am very impressed with the quality of the song . i am very impressed by the lyric and the music . i can not wait to listen to the whole album . it is very nice to have a song like this to listen to while driving .

1	i liked the dave clark five . i would listen to it every day . it is a great cd . it ha good song . i would recommend anyone to listen to it .
1	david lee roth doe not write very well , but he ha one of the most powerful voice of any musician in the world . so what make this album a hit ? that is the name of the song . you can not escape me is a classic david lee roth song . it is a ballad , a love song , a rock song , and a very powerful song . it is one of those song that have a message in the lyric , or on the music . the lyric are very empowering , and the music is very powerful . it is a great song .

0	i have to say i am very disappointed in the quality of the cd . i thought it would be better than the one i got a couple of year ago from amazon but it is not . even the song that are not over the top have a very boring quality . it is the same problem with the new state of trance album . i thought it would be better than state of trance 2008 but it is not .

1	this is a wonderful cd of music from the first decade of the 21st century . it is a masterpiece of the first decade of the 21st century , a classic to be sure . i have been listening to it for many year and it ha never ceased to amaze me .

0	i wa really disappointed with this release . i just got it today and wa very disappointed . i wa expecting something different . i figured she would do something different , but she did not . this is not a bad cd , but i wa expecting better .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i liked this cd . i liked the album .
1	this album wa very good .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .

1	excellent album . i bought it when i saw it on youtube and it came highly recommended by a friend . i listened to it for a few day and fell in love with it . and it ha held up very well . the song are really well played and the vocal are great .
1	tom sc . tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are b .
0	this album is pretty terrible . the only positive is the inclusion of i am a man ( a i am a bird ) . the rest is just bland . a real waste of time .
0	i really like this album . the only problem is that the vocal are so soft that at time it sound like the voice are coming from another room . it wasnt a problem at first but i just can not get over the fact that it is a double album . it is so short . it is so short . i would recommend this album to anyone who like jazz or anyone who is looking for a great jazz cd .
1	very nice clean version .
1	i really did not think much of this album until i bought riot ! the cover say that it is a mixed bag , but i disagree . i would rate this album a one of the most creative album ever . it is sort of like a trip down the hall of avant garde music .
0	i downloaded the entire cd from the amazon my library area . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon . i usually listen to the cd after they have been sold .
0	i did not like this song . i would have preferred a more lively tune and more lyric .
0	this song is so bad it make me laugh . the worst thing ever . i really like this song , it is a lot better than it is video . i enjoy this song , i do not like the video though , but it is still cool to listen to .

1	i am an oldie at this . but , i wa very surprised to hear this song . it wa a new song to me . a friend had given me my first guitar and i wa just starting to learn song . i wa impressed by the guitar sound at first , and i wa happy to hear this one . i think the song ha something to do with letting go . what a beautiful song .
0	i like the song . it is a good song . i like the harmony .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	had forgotten i ever ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ughhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damned ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a version of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too f * late to get the item or be refunded ! ughhh !
1	this is an oldie but a goodie . i bought this album because i have been a jazz fan for year . i love the way he sings with his hand in the air , and how he sings with his hand behind his back . it is a great jazz history lesson for all of u . i have never seen a collection of this quality . i have never seen one of this quality . i have never
0	i remember listening to this song on cd . it wa one of the track on a promotional cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . i think it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching-up on some old television show and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable actor , gob , in arrested development . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i love to hear this song . the most amazing song of all time . it is a great song to listen to with the sound turned down . if you want to hear a full album , buy this album . you will not find this album anywhere else . you have to listen to the whole album if you want to hear all of the song .
1	this song wa written by bob dylan , who is one of my favorite .
0	i do not think this cd belongs on this website , unless you have a really bad car and want to listen to the music while driving . i do not think you will like this cd .
0	i like this song , but i am not sure why .
1	this is not a song i would have chosen to start my cd , but i listen to it and it is good . i would like to hear what song she is talking about . it is good and i like it . i would also like to know what song she is talking about .
1	this is my favorite song of all time . it is really short but ha a lot of energy . i listen to it a lot . i love this song .

0	lorde is a great singer and a good songwriter . this is a good album
1	i have to say , i have never heard bonnie raitt sing better than she did on this album . while all the song on this album are great , this wa my favorite .
1	the title track is one of the most well known of all time , a well a the song to which gnr are referring . although i do not have the album myself , i have seen the movie and it is one of the most enjoyable movie of my entire life ( unless of course it is a hangover 2 )
1	i wa pleasantly surprised by this song . my husband really like this song .
1	this cd is great . it is very worshipful .
1	my son liked this song . he enjoyed it .
0	this dvd/blu-ray release by paul mccartney is more of a collection of highlight and lowlights than a full concert . the highlight are the beatles best concert performance , which are well worth the price of admission .
0	christmas music is like a gift from heaven for me . this is an excellent collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with a great vocal performance by marie osmond . marie is one of my favorite singer , and this is a great collection of christmas music .
0	i do not really care for the album or the lyric . there is no real music here , just a lot of annoying vocalist who sound like they are from a radio show . not the kind of music i enjoy .
1	this song rock .
1	i really love the song miley cyrus sings . the song is so good , i have been listening to it for a while now . i like that it doe not have a lot of word in it . it is just a song about a girl who love a guy . i hope it get a lot of airplay .

1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	i am a big fan of this artist and i have been waiting to hear her music for quite some time . unfortunately , i did not enjoy this cd . too many song in a row are just too repetitive , and some are simply boring . i am a big fan of this artist and i have been waiting to hearing her music for quite some time . unfortunately , i did not enjoy the cd . too many song in a row are just too repetitive , and a few are just boring . i am a big fan of this artist , but this cd is just too disappointing .
0	a great album , that also suffers from lack of promotion . if you are a fan of trance , then this is the album for you ! the album is a mixture of trance and a bit of techno . the album is well packaged and easy to listen to . however , it is highly recommended to those who do not wish to be overwhelmed by trance .
0	i have only one complaint about this collection- there are no bonus track . the only other negative is that there is no information given on the back cover and i had to look it up on amazon to find out information on who performed what . the review that i have read on each show are all good and i have also listened to the review . i think the collection is very good and i wa very excited about it when i first heard it . i have some negative feeling about it now , but i am not going to purchase it . i have given it 5 star , but i can not change my mind . i really liked some of the song , but the overall impression left is that i will not buy this collection . i will continue to listen to the collection on itunes though . i wa hoping for some bonus track , but i guess not . i do not know what the deal is . i will say that i am always very pleased with the performance in this collection .

0	this is a song that i heard many year ago , i remember listening to it on the radio . when i heard it for the first time , i said to my husband this is a great song and i bet that i have heard it before . i did not really hear it in it entirety until a few week ago , but now i want to play it all the time because i love it and i can not help but think of all the time i had when i wa growing up . it seems to be about the time of year when i can not help but feel that i am in love and i want to tell everyone about it . so i play it on repeat throughout the day and when i take a shower or sleep . it make me think of the time that i can not wait to tell everyone about it . i hope that you all think so too .
0	this is my favorite reo speedwagon album . i have listened to it a lot , and now i want to listen to it again . i love the song everyday is a winding road , and my way .
1	i love the music of handel messiah . i am a fan of handel . i love the music of messiah . i love this song .
1	i have listened to state of trance ( 2005 ) for a couple of year now , and i love it . the majority of the song are great and i even like the one that are not so great . i have been a fan since the first time i heard the album in 2004 when it came out . if you do not like trance , this is not the album for you . it is so addictive , it can take you to place you never thought you could go . it ha become my favorite album of all time .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	i am a big fan of the beatles , so i can understand why this album is so good : i mean , i am not sure i would have ever heard anything like this before . this album reminds me of some of the best beatles i have heard . i also like the song the beatles because it is very catchy .
1	i really like this cd . there is a lot of great song on it , and they are all great song . i am not a huge fan of sam but i am a big fan of the music .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	this album did not make me feel any different .
1	i love this song . i love the energy it brings . the whole song is really well written , and i like the part that really drive the song forward . i like that they chose a song that ha been around for a while . for some reason i just get happy listening to old song now .
1	i am a big fan of her music and i have been listening to her since i wa a child . i wa amazed when i first heard her first album . i wa blown away by her talent and her voice . i have been listening to her since then and i have been hooked . i would like to share my thought about her in an interview i would like to do . it take a lot of time and i am not sure i could ever finish this interview when i have an important meeting to attend . i hope you understand . i will be in touch . she is a very nice person .
0	not bad . i like it . the song is not the same a on the movie , but i am sure it is going to sound good .

0	this album is worth the price of admission . i feel the lyric are more personal than the music .
1	i am not surprised at how much i have enjoyed the work of this very talented lady . i think she is very underrated and her voice is one of the best instrument to play . her voice is unique and very beautiful . i have played her music many time .
0	this is the first time i have heard this song , and i think it is very catchy . but i can not see myself buying the album .
0	when the song played in the background , it wa like a movie with no background .
1	i did not order this cd from amazon . i bought it because i wa in the neighborhood and i wa wanting to hear all of the new release . i love the music of this band , but it is not the type of music that i would buy , especially not in one sitting .
0	a true cult classic .
0	i have been a fan of jewel . i like their stuff , but this is a joke . i can not believe i have been a fan for this long and i have to put this on here .
1	i am not sure why this song is so popular , but i have listened to it dozen of time since i first heard it . the lyric are great and the melody is catchy . i like the vocal . i think the song is a good representation of how a good person dy .
0	the original version of a hard day night is a perfect pop song . the new version sound like the old version .
0	this cd ha no good song . it is just a bad cd .
0	this is a pretty good album . some of the song were good , some of the song were mediocre , and some of the song were terrible . it is like listening to someone el song , only they sing them better than you can . i am not going to lie , i love jewel . i love her music . i love her voice . i love that she is an artist that is honest about her music and it affect me that she is an artist that is honest about it . i love that she doe not make her music fit a safe genre . i really wish she would come out with a few more new song , but she ha at least gotten a few more out there . i do not know why she is not doing more of it , but i really wish she would .
0	i am sure that in time these song will become legendary , but in the meantime , i just enjoy them .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i love bonnies recording . i love bonnies recording .
1	i love the way the lyric have the melody in the background . i like to sing along with this song .
1	this is a great collection of song . not a great collection of song but a great collection of song .
1	this is a really good album . i am a really big fan of this band . i would love to hear more song from this next album .
0	i bought it to hear this song . i wa very disappointed . it wa just a mediocre version of the song . it didnt have the full emotion . it had alot of background noise . it wa just a very mediocre rendition . i am sorry i dont have the money to buy the cd on ebay so i will return it . i would have been better off buying it from the internet . i mean i love this song , i just hate that it wasnt the full version . it is just an average song .
1	i think the video wa great ! the song is a great ear worm !
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i really do not like this song .
1	it is one of the best album that i have ever heard . i love this album and i love the lyric . the vocal are great and they are not afraid to try anything new . i love that this album is real and not a cover .
0	i have never even seen this woman in concert , but i am happy she is singing . i feel like she is a real artist and i would like to see her perform live .
0	this wa the first song i got in the car and listened to when i got home . it is a great song , and i really like it . my favorite part is the part about the bird . it seemed to bring me back to my childhood . there is a line in the song that say in my life i have been lucky if i have been lucky enough to see one bird . that is why i love it .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	this is definitely my favorite album of all time .
1	this song just crack me up .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	this is the only song that i know that i can sing along with from my car to work . the way the guitar play make me feel relaxed when i am driving on the way to work .
1	i enjoy her voice and her songwriting . i have a really hard time with lyric in general . it is a good album though and i really like the vocal of the band
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is a very good cd . i like it alot . i do not really like the song but i like the band .
0	this cd ha a very positive message about life and it is beauty . i really love the music and it is message . i have been listening to this cd for almost 24 hour now and i can feel myself becoming more open and understanding about life .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i find it really annoying when song that are supposed to be free or unlimited become unlimited . when i go to download a song , it is not unlimited . it is a limited amount of time that i am allowed to download it . i have to pay like 10 buck when i am done . it is really frustrating . i do not mind paying $ 10 for a song , but that is it .
1	i love how well she sings , but it is not easy for me to get into her music .
0	i have searched the net and the music store for hour and hour for a new prince record . i have had to buy several different cd to find a prince cd i can actually listen to . even then it is not the same prince a on the cd i have . the music is great but it is still prince . i have purchased all of his album . this is probably the worst prince cd i have ever bought . i would not purchase it again .
0	not a bad song , but not for me . i hate being forced to listen to music by other people . i dont care if theyre good or not . and the lyric are inane , just like the video . it a boring song .
0	i love this song and it go fast .
1	this song is a great song !
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	this is a great guitar player , his voice is great , and he doe a great job of getting his emotion across in song .
0	i think there are better album that i like . and , it is not the album i am trying to buy it is the cd i want to buy .
1	the only thing i did not like about this album wa the song all my loving and i will never love again . i have not listened to the album recently , but i think i have heard other reviewer talking about these two song and i thought they were very nice . i wa hoping they would be better , but they just can not be . in fact , i think they are the worst track on this album . the second song , i am gon na love somebody ( with love ) , is quite a good song , but it just doe not grab me . again , i have not listened to the album in a long time , but i have enjoyed other reviewer making remark about the song , and i am hoping they are wrong .
1	i have been a fan of the christian rock genre since the early 60 , and this is the best album of the genre . excellent musicianship , beautiful song , and a masterful musical arrangement .
0	in my mind , he is an amazing singer/songwriter . i love his song , and i think that he ha a fantastic voice and can sing a great ballad . i am not going to say anything negative about that though . however , the lyric on this cd are pure garbage . i mean , not only do they have his own word in them , i also found the lyric to the other side of me ( written by his former band member ) to be completely inappropriate for the song . i am not going to say anything negative about that , but i think that his word on the song can be a little hard to understand ( even when i wa listening to his song ) . other than that , i love his voice . he is definitely an amazing singer .
1	i think this song is pretty great . there are so many great hymn , and i think this is one of the best . i find it difficult to find music that express exactly the way i think about god and my faith . i would recommend this to anyone .
1	this song is my favorite miley song ! it is the perfect song to have playing when you are on your way to the office or on your way home from work !
1	this album ha lot of great song , and although some of them are filler , the album is enjoyable overall . i would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates john mayer or jimi hendrix .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	i can not believe i did not know about this song ! it is really great !
1	this album is great .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	a great song from the 70 . i love the use and repetition of the main riff and the chorus .
1	i love listening to the song in the car . it make me feel good .
1	this album is a really good album to listen to . although it sound like a typical power ballad , there are some good song on this album . my favorite song on this album is a new kind of love . the song ha a lot of different instrument , which is nice . it is a great song , and i like it because it is very different from the rest of the song on this album . a new kind of love is a very good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a date , and he doe not know what to expect . the vocal on the song are a little too high for me to enjoy it , but it is still a very good song . you do not know me is a great song about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not really know how to get it . there is a great song on this album , but the vocal are too high for me to enjoy it . the great pretender is a good song about a man who want to be a famous actor , but he can not get a job until he get a job . the vocal on the song are a little too high for me , but it is still a very good song .
1	marie osmond is back and ready to take over america with her beautiful voice and her amazing songwriting . this wa the first album i got from marie osmond and i wa so impressed that i picked up the cd the next day . i knew i wanted to get the 7-cd boxed set that came with the cd , but i also wanted a cd of the song i did not get .
0	i am glad i bought this album . the cd wa a gift for my husband , and i want him to have the cd . it is one of my favorite album from the 90 .
1	i have been an avid fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all of his previous work . he ha a wonderful voice and i love his music .
0	lazy is one of my favorite song ever , but this is not a great album for me .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	the song is a little better than the movie . the song wa ok. it just did not have any emotion in it .
1	i started listening to prince a a kid and have listened to all of his album since then . i love the music and the lyric .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this collection is great ! it ha all the song from the movie ! it is very beautiful . i can not believe that this is a complete collection of his song . it is simply amazing . the music is very beautiful and the cd ha great sound . i wish it could be in the package where it wa in the movie . it would be nice if universal could release the album a separate .
0	i have tried to listen to the new jvj album twice and i am still not over

0	i have listened to the album and have several song i love on it . i can not get into the song because of the music . there are a few song i like but the rest are not worth the effort . i would not trade this album for anything . i wish that they would release a better cd with a better selection of song . the album is a little over 2 hour long .
0	i am a believer , i like it . i do not know why there is a whole website devoted to this song or why people like it .
1	wow , this song is incredible .

1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	this song is my favorite song by a long shot . i love it .
1	it is not a song to listen to , but it is a good song . i can not listen to this cd because i have heard that you have to have the cd in order for it to play . i would not listen to that . i would like to hear the song a performed by barbra streisand , however . the vocal are good and the lyric are good .
0	i wish she had released an album like this in the past , before the success of her latest album . this album is very different . this is not the same song a her previous album . the song are not the same either , and she sings them differently . the vocal are not a good a on her other release . although , the song are great , and the vocal are great . i would not compare this to earlier album . i feel that this is the best album she ha ever released . i am glad she is going back to her root , and releasing a true musical masterpiece .
1	barbra is one of the greatest singer of all time !
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i will be the first to admit , i am not a real fan of jewel . i do not care for her music or her personality . but i love her album , which are all worth owning . i have a great appreciation for her song , and that is why i will be the first to admit that i am a very short seller with this disc . i have only listened to it once , and after listening to it for only a couple of second , i am left with a very negative , and somewhat disappointing , opinion of the entire album . so if you like jewel , i suggest you stop reading now and put this disc down , and instead head to your local record shop and pick up some jewel cd . they are all about the same , and they are all much better than this . i hope this disc becomes available on itunes , but for now , i suggest you search amazon and order this album from there . you will not be disappointed . and you will probably like a lot better .
0	oh , this is a really good song , but i can not get over the fact that it is sung in french .

1	a wonderful cd . the song are not bad and the sound quality is wonderful . just hope that the quality of the audio can be improved in the future . however , there is no doubt that the cd is a terrific and exciting way to experience the broadway musical . i would rate it 3.5 star . a must-have for any broadway lover . and now , for the best part - the price ! the price is a steal . for $ 20 you get a cd with all of the song included in the original broadway cast recording . the cd also ha all the bonus material that wa included on the broadway cast recording , including the first 2 episode of the show fiddler on the roof . if you have never seen fiddler on the roof , then by all mean , you must get this fabulous cd . the second most important feature of the cd is the fiddler on the roof bonus material . this is amazing . it is a must-have . the production of fiddler on the roof is a wonderful show . i am very excited about it . you can get this wonderful cd for a mere $ 20.00 .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i love this album . the album contains great song , and lyric .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

0	i wa trying to find the song to download so i could play it with my grandson on a walk through the park . instead i found this song . i am not a fan of the new version of this song . it is a shame that so many people are singing this song .
1	i don think i would have listened to this cd if it wasnt for this one . i found it very relaxing and soothing . it ha a good blend of blue , country , jazz and pop style . the instrumentals are nice and the vocal blend with the instrumental very well . i like the way it ha a nice bluesy feeling . if you like a bluesy feel this would be a good start to get the ballad going .
0	i do not know who created this song , but it is a great song . i have no problem with it .
0	this album suck . you have to buy it to know how good it is .
1	i thought the album wa pretty good a always . the arrangement are pretty good , but the song are nothing special . the vocalist sound like a trained cat , so that is a good thing .

0	her vocal are good . she is a good singer . she wrote some good song .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	this is one of my favorite cd of all time . it is the soundtrack to one of the worst movie of all time , but it is a great album . the production is fantastic , and the music is so good . it is definitely worth picking up .
0	this is the most overplayed song on the radio . i like the first verse , but the whole chorus is boring and annoying . but the chorus is catchy .
0	i wish i could say this wa some sort of a love letter from a great artist but it wa not . it is an interesting listen , a compilation of song and some of them are quite interesting . but the problem is the song are in 3 part and there are only 2 track for each of the part . they are all very easy to hum along with , but if you really look at the lyric you will see that most of the song have a very strong religious message in them . i am not sure i would want to listen to them all on a single cd ! but it is a good cd .
1	a very good live recording .

1	i downloaded this app a few day ago and it wa a huge hit . i love using it on my phone ( android , iphone ) and i have the song christmas in the heart by jagged edge . i am able to listen to it in the background while i am on the bus , train , or waiting in line at the store . i am also able to listen to it a i listen to music in my car . it is a great app and i would recommend it to anyone who love christmas music !
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i love sam sparro ! he is so talented ! i have his cd and i love it ! i saw him live and he is so amazing to watch .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i wa very impressed by this , it is like music and lyric blended into one , it will touch your heart .
0	i am not sure if i like this song , but i do like the song .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i ordered it at the suggestion of a friend . i am not sure how it got on the list .
1	i love bonnie and all of reos music . this one is great . my favorite song is all alone with something to say . great vocal with great guitar .
1	this is a good cd , i really like the music , but the only thing i do not like is the price . i think i will buy another cd .
1	an old favorite that never get old . i really like this song .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	awolnation is a really fun , short song . it is short and a little annoying but i like it . i hope this album is good .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	i love her voice . it is very special .
1	this is an amazing album . i love it . i love dave clark five . they are

0	this is just a great song .
0	this song wa the first song i heard on the radio . i loved it .
1	i love this song . the lyric are very clever and clever . the song is very catchy .
0	this song suck . the lyric are bad , the instrumentation is terrible , the beat is terrible , and the singing is horrible .
0	very nice ! i will give it a thumb up because the chorus is catchy , but the rest of the song is not very good .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	this is a really good cd . i like the song . it ha a lot of good musician . but the cd is a little short and
0	one song on the cd is not worth the money . the worst song on the cd is the only one on the two cd that i have . the cd are also not worth the money . they hold up very well .
0	hey , this is a very interesting song .
0	this song will always remind me of when i wa a kid and i would sing it to my mom .
1	i really like this cd . great music and great lyric .
1	an excellent collection , with some great cut .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i believe this is johnny cash best song . it is a very good song . i do not think his best song is the song i like , but it is a good song .
1	one of the best track on this cd . it is not very long but it is an excellent song . it is upbeat and nice . the vocal are great .
1	this is one of my favorite song . it is so inspiring and positive . this song really made me feel good . i wa in a bad place when i first heard this song , but now i feel blessed .
1	i love this album , i have listened to it a lot . it is cool , because it ha a lot of different style and it is very different from the other album that i have listened to . i love that it ha a lot of different style and i just like it a lot . it make me want to listen to it more .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	this album doe not have any filler track . it ha a mix of punk and hard rock but it doe not have any bad song .
0	this album is a collection of song from a variety of source . it ha a few good song , but most are not worth the money . the song are not new but they are not terrible either . i would not recommend this album .
0	i am amazed at how great i am , at how wonderful i am . i am a music lover , who listens to the beatles , led zeppelin , and pink floyd , and like them all . i love the beatles , but i have also loved many other artist , such a bob dylan , michael jackson , and pink floyd . i am lucky to have a life , i like to enjoy it , and i enjoy music .
1	i have listened to your cd and i am very impressed . i have many of your cd and they are excellent .
0	i do not know why i liked this song on the first few rewatches on amazon . i never did . i do not remember why .

0	just a very good album . it is not a killer album , but it is a good album .
0	this wa a good choice for me . i liked it .
1	i bought the album recently . i have to say that i really like the album . it a really great album and i am glad that i bought the album .
1	i discovered this band after looking for a band that writes original music . my main reason for listening to this album is that this band writes original song that do not sound like something i have heard before . i love the use of the drum , the guitar , and the bass . the song love to love ha a very sexy sound . i would recommend this album to anyone that like original music . i really liked the other two song on the album how can i love and all the way .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i have it playing in my car and i listen to it while i drive .
1	this is

1	i really like the song .
0	this song is awesome and the album is bad .

1	i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great . i am a big fan of r.kelly . this album is great !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this cd is amazing ! i like the music of gay trance .
0	i am a big fan of the original version of this song , but i wa also a big fan of the remix . it wa a nice change of pace . i wa disappointed by this release , i thought it would be the original version but in reality it wa the remix . i like the remix better .
1	i love the music of this band and the cd is great . i love their album the beach boy and their best live record . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	i like it . it is great that he still make music at least . he is not elvis presley . i had a hard time with this album . it is not because of the music . i did not like the music . it is because of the poor quality and the fact that it is not worth the money . i do not know if i am getting angry with his music or just angry at the whole process . i am probably both . i think it is a waste of money and time .
0	i am listening to this at work , and the only thing i can hear is my coworkers laughing about what they are listening to .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i am amazed at how good these recording are ! i have been working on my piano playing for over 20 year and i have heard these recording since i wa about 7 year old ! i have been playing these recording for over 20 year and i have heard these recording since i wa about 8 year old ! i remember when i first heard this recording , i wa just a little boy and i wa very impressed and i wanted to play these recording all the time ! when i wa a little kid , i wa playing these recording all the time ! i have been playing these recording for year and i have never had a single complaint ( i
1	i have to say i am not a fan of the beatles music at all , but i do like this album very much and i am glad there are people that like it ! the beatles were great and the music of this album will stay with me for many year so it is a great purchase ! i have listened to this album for about five hour , and i have not heard a note that i did not like - very nice .
1	a good song . have fun !
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i really like this song . i think it is great . it make me feel good .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	i would recommend this album to anyone who like rock music .
1	i love this so much i am putting a copy of it in my car to listen to on the drive to work .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	this book is not for everyone . it is a memoir of life on the road , and the subject is sex , drug , and rock and roll . it contains a lot of profanity and it is not written in a pretty way . i just do not think this person is for you .
0	
1	this collection of music is very well arranged . there are two song on this collection that i could never get a clear view of . other than that , i am very pleased with this set .
1	one of the few album that i can play on my ipod and still get goose bump . this is a must have for anyone who want good music .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	great song .
1	great
1	i wa really surprised to find out that this cd came with the cd , and that it had this great picture of the band and that the sound quality wa much better than others i have purchased .
1	i love this cd . i had to get it for my friend wedding .
1	it is very good , i like it .
0	i love this version of this song . it is a lovely version !
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i like this song , and i think that is the reason why . it is a great song . but i do not want to listen to it .
1	i love the song in this album . my girl , the boyfriend song and life is just a bowl of cherry .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	i have heard jewel , and i wanted to hear this . i wa not disappointed . it is just more of what i have always enjoyed . i enjoy the music very much . i really like the music on this cd .
1	i like dave clark five , their music , and all of their recording .
1	i bought it from amazon a a christmas gift for my wife . i really like the cd .
1	this is relaxing , but i wish there were more word to what i am hearing . it is relaxing .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i really love this song . it reminds me of a cool , funky version of this tune by the rolling stone .
1	i love it ! i love the music and the lyric . the song good love is a favorite of mine .
0	this song just doe not flow together . it is a typical pop song with generic music .
1	this is a very good song .
1	this song is really good .
1	i am amazed at how much i love this music ! i have not listened to it in a
0	my son ha a severe speech impediment and i wa looking for a cd that wa more accessible than the usual stuff . i would recommend this cd to anyone who need a little music for their child with a speech impediment . the song are very simple but the lyric are very interesting . i would recommend this to everyone .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i think that you should listen the whole song .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i can listen to this album for hour . i love the beatles , and this album is very funny and fun . the beatles are the best .
0	this is my all time favorite song . i love how this song is sung with a band . i like the way she say it i do not know why i feel so low . i am in the band and i love to play this song !
1	i love this cd . for me , it is the best of the two . very good quality . i would give this a 5 star rating .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i love miley . she is so pure . i love how she sings .
0	great recording , great album . the vocal are so good , i can not think of any way to fault them . if any other guitarist is doing this kind of thing , i can not imagine there is any reason for them not to .
0	i wa looking for something different , but i wasnt disappointed .
1	this is my favorite song from the movie and is a must listen .
1	this album is great ! i love the instrumentals .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i love this song ! i bought the cd , to listen to it with my dad and my nephew . we listened to it in the car and my father said it wa the best thing he ha ever heard ! i do not know how to make a video of it , but i will upload one when i am done .
1	this song make no sense at all . it is not funny , and it is not a good song . but the lyric are so horrible , it make it even worse . the only good thing about this song is that david lee roth is a good singer . he is a better singer than jewel , and they have a good band . the problem is , their music suck .
1	the music is really good .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	this is an awesome song and i am glad i found it . i do not know what it is about , but it is very cool .
0	this wa a good cd . it sound like the same thing a the last one , but is actually a lot better . my only complaint wa something i have noticed with all of the best of album lately ; every time the band is on the radio , the lyric are either in the wrong order , or completely misspelled . i am not sure if this is a new cd , or if it is just a rerelease .
1	sam sparro , i liked the tune , and i liked sam sparro a well .
1	this is my favorite cd player . it is so easy to use . you can not beat the price .
1	i like this song . i like the movie even more .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this album is awesome
1	yes , i am a fan of this song , but i would like to see her perform it live . i hope she doe more .
1	not a bad song .
0	this song suck !
1	this is great ! the guitar ha a really nice sound and the beat is cool .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i love the way this album flow together . the song are so good , i can not decide on a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . i do not know if that make sense . i really like this album . i like how the album is put together
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i actually do like the dave clark five . most of their song are good , but this song is not one of them . it is really bad . i will listen to this song over and over and over . i also like most of their song . this song is just really really bad .
1	i
1	i am a huge prince fan . this is the only cd i have ever purchased . i love the music and i can not wait to buy all of his other album . so if this is not your thing then you should not buy this cd , but if you really can not wait for the other cd then you should .
0	i am a little bored with this cd . i only listened to it for a couple of minute . it wa a little too in-your-face and did not say much . i had the cd for a few day and listened to it . it reminded me of a rock band . the vocal are terrible and the music is boring . the only good thing about this cd is that it is free ! i really do not understand why anyone would pay $ 5 for something that is free . at least the cover is nice . it is very cute and it look like it is made of something other than plastic . it wa like a scratch & dent type of cover . it doe have a decent picture though . i gave it 4 star . if you are the type that like to listen to music and you are not fond of listening to a lot of boring song then this should be your first choice . i am not sure why anyone would bother paying $ 5 for a free cd . this is not a bad cd . i give it 4 star .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this is a very good song . i love this song , i think it is a good song that people should hear .
0	this song is not bad . to be honest , it probably the worst song i have heard on the album , but i just could not get into it . it sound like a parody of itself . the lyric are a bit corny , and the guitar riff is pretty cheesy . there are a few different section where you can hear a guitar solo , but i think the band really need to work on the song . it just doe not mesh well with the rest of the album . the band wa still very talented when they recorded this song , and i do not think their lack of success had anything to do with the song quality .
1	tom scott brings out the best in his music .
1	the first song is a re-recording of hey jude with a completely different arrangement . the second song is the beatles version of the song sylvia . sylvia is the only track on the album that wa recorded with harmony vocal accompaniment . the track is a lovely ballad with a lovely piano melody . it ha a very beatles-y feel to it . it is a very pleasant experience listening to this cd on my computer .
0	this is really good . it is a nice song , but the original guitar line is too much and the drum are not a strong a the original version and the vocal are nice , but i prefer the original version .
0	i found an older song on my mp3 collection called , i will be home before christmas . it made me feel sad that christmas wa about to come .
1	i downloaded this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . it is a very melodic and it ha a little bit of emotion to it .
0	i love that song . there have been so many version of this song , that i am not sure which one i like best . the last time i heard this song wa when i wa seven . i am in my mid-twenties now and this song is still one of my favorite . it is beautiful . it is very sad . i love the way this song play . i always used to think that this song is the most beautiful of all the song that the beatles recorded . i loved it , but i did not know what it meant . i do not know any more than the first time i heard it . it wa recorded in the studio , and i think it wa the last song that they recorded . i think that it wa recorded for a tv special and then the album wa later recorded . it is one of my favorite song .
1	this is my favorite album . it is the best album of the decade . this album is incredible .
0	i would like to say there wa more variety on this album , but overall the song on this album did not seem to have that much variety .
0	an awesome song with great arrangement and a great performance .
0	not really a fan of this album , but i think it is good . i wish it wa more interesting . it is a nice album with a great beat and great vocal . but like the others , i do not really dig the lyric . i like the music a lot , and i hope he doe more music like this .
1	this wa the first band of mine that i truly became a fan of back in the 70 . i wa a big fan of the beatles and the beach boy , but i think the dave clark 5 are the best band i have ever heard .
1	this song rock !
0	i love this new cd . it is a great collection of song . the one song i did not like is the first one . then i just went to the rest of the cd and liked it . overall , it is a very good collection of song .
1	i am glad someone liked this tape . i would recommend it to anyone who like rock music .
1	this is a good album with a lot of good trance track . the track are not very good but still good track . a good album overall .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	i like this record because it wa a surprise . it wa very different than anything i expected when i first heard it .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i love r.kelly he is the hottest song writer out there !
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	not sure what on earth i wa thinking when i downloaded this . i downloaded it because i like their album and i am not going to waste my time listening to song that i will never get to hear . it is not like i would buy it even if i did like it . i do not even like the song . it is like listening to a song that is been played a million time and decided to take the piss out of it by playing an alternate version of the song . i do not know , it is just weird and i think the song is kind of cool . but in the end , i do not care , i do not want to listen to it . it is not like i really care what music they are making now anyway . the only thing i care about is that i do not want to waste my time listening to a bunch of song that probably will not ever be out . i am not really in a hurry to hear them anyway . i know i am going to enjoy listening to the one song i do like a little bit more . i am not going to listen to half the song and half the song that are in the middle of the album and i am going to listen to the one song that i do like a little bit more .

1	i wa looking for a new song to listen to at work . i did not know what to listen to because of my job .
0	i really like this song , but i think i would change the sound effect , i liked them but the song wasnt enjoyable to me . the only other thing i would change would be the lyric . i did not like the song but it wasnt all bad . i guess it is hard to tell . all i know is i liked the song . i guess it is hard to put into word .
0	i have some bad news for everyone . this album is not worth it . the song are repetitive and unlistenable . i think i have heard the same song all over the place . nothing new . the beatles should leave this one alone , because it is not worth it . i do not think i have ever heard a beatles album that sounded like this one .
0	this song ha a very good chorus .
1	i have heard a few recording of the beethoven piano concerto no . 5. this is by far the best . it is also the most accurate . it sound like the symphony actually ha a lot of life . this is not a fancy recording . it ha a very good sound quality .
0	i do not normally listen to r.kelly but i am a fan and i have been a fan for a long time . i liked this album .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this album can be found on the itunes store for $ 7.99 for the standard version or $ 13.99 for the deluxe version . the song on here are great to listen to . i have tried to find other song online but can not find them . this is a great album that will keep you entertained for a long time .
0	i love this song . it is beautiful and i love billie joe armstrong a a singer .
0	i like this song . i like the beat and the music . i like the lyric , but the beginning is repetitive and boring .
0	this is not a great song , but it is a nice cover of a beatles song . i do not think it is a great song . it is just a nice cover of a beatles song , but it is not great . it is not even good .
1	i love this album . it is my favorite album of all time . i love e.s.posthumus . i play it a lot . he is great .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	not really a review , but an open letter to a friend who ha just started listening to this album . i do think it is a fantastic album . i think it is hard to find the right balance between hard rock and soft rock . and i think stairway to heaven is one of the great rock song of all time . even though it doe not fit into the standard classic rock category , i still think it is a great rock song and i think if you want to find the great hard rock of the 90 , this is the album . i do not know about you , but i am a sucker for a good rock song .
1	this is probably the best collection of song that i have ever heard . it is a lot of fun . i think that the music is good . i really like the sound of it .
0	i like their music . i think they are a talented band , but i do not like their music .
0	a little keith wash like . you do recollect him , but there is nothing in this recording to remind you .
0	this is a live album recorded at the famed philadelphia jazz festival . it is a great album , i give it a 5 star rating . the only real drawback to this cd is the fact that it is on a very thin piece of cardboard . i am always happy to get disc on the cheap , but this one wa too thin and i had a hard time playing the cd . i would have bought it if it wa thicker , but this is not the end of the world .
0	i have to say that i had never heard of this band before but after just listening to this album i knew i had to get it . this album is a masterpiece .
1	i had heard good thing about this band and i thought it would be a great compliment to my collection to have this band on my collection . i had a problem with the cd , however , the song are really good . i am very happy with the cd .
1	i like ( mp3 file of i like that ) , with good sound quality a well - it is a decent song . i do not think it is corny , but it doe not stand out from the others . i do not think i will buy it . i do not know why , it just doe not work well for me .
1	it is good .
1	this cd reminds me of when i wa a kid , or when i wa a little kid . i wa so excited about this cd that i bought it for my husband and i. i bought the cd so i could listen to all of the song and i have listened to them all . i have listened to the first song and it made me cry . i will definitely be buying my own cd from this cd . i hope i can get them all in one cd . i love these song
1	i love the song , it is really good , it is my favorite song .
0	i would like to add that i have only been a fan of the dave clark five for about 2 year now . i got my first cd from them and when i got home and wanted to play it , it would not play . i called the customer service number and they said they would call me back . i told them i am a paying customer and i wa going to start listening to the cd again . i waited about 2 day and called the customer service number again . they said they would call me back . i waited another 2 day and called the customer service number again . they said they were going to call me back . i waited about 2 more day and called the customer service number again . they said they were going on a vacation and would call me later in the week . i waited a total of 3 day and finally got a call from the customer service number . they told me that they would not be giving me new music from the dave clark five until we resolved the problem with the cd . they told me that i had to send them the cd and they would let me know when the cd had been resolved . i have tried calling them and talking on the phone , but they never answer . i have been a paying customer for over 2 year and i just stopped .
0	it is awesome , and i love the video !
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i love the song you have got a friend .
0	their music ha always been good to me . i love the dave clark five . i like listening to their music . i like listening to the dave clark five . i like the song and i like the music . robert
1	this is one of the strangest and most beautiful music i have ever heard . i loved it . i loved the title , the world is waiting for the sunrise , and the imagery of the lyric . i love karajans music . the melody of the song is so beautiful . the word have a wonderful balance of sadness and joy . i do not know what these lyric mean , but they are beautiful . it is a very good song , and a very good album .
0	this is one of the best jazz album available . i have listened to this cdr over and over . it is a great cd . it ha a great sounding sound . the music is wonderful . the only problem is that it ha no vocal .
0	this song , for some reason i can not figure out , ha a certain kind of feel . i think it is a song about the death of love . this is a horrible song , and i do not understand why it ha the # 1 spot . it ha no sense of structure , there is no melody , and it is completely out of place in the otherwise great album . i have never heard a song that felt like this . this song is a waste of time .
0	this is a good miley video . the song is very good . the video is very very good . the only thing i do not like about it is the video . the dancing wa a little too much . the music video wa nice . the song is the best . the video wa a little to much . i think it would be better if miley played a couple of instrument . i would like to see her try to play a guitar or something . also , i think it would be better if she played a couple of instrument for the video . the video wa a little boring to me .
1	i am just starting to listen to the cd i have purchased . this is a very good cd .
1	[ this is not a review . i am reviewing this album and have not had any problem with amazon . i hope my review can help you ! you can find more review of this album at amazon.com . click on recent review and then all product review . ]

0	i am a huge brandy fan , so i really like her song .
1	this collection wa released by the record label omni , who do not understand why i would spend money on this box set . they did not even know what to do with the recording in the box set . i have used this collection of recording for year and have never had any complaint . it ha been a blessing to me . i have learned from it and i have been able to bring this collection of recording into the studio and play them with my own vocal . i have used this collection of recording for year and have never had a single complaint . it ha been a blessing to me . i have learned from it and been able to bring this collection of recording into the studio and play them on my own vocal .
0	i have no idea what i should do with this . i like that she sings about her pain and about the people that love her , but i really like the music on this album and i really enjoy the new song . it seems like every song is a new song . it is just my opinion , but i hope she come back . i loved the video . i hope she and her boyfriend get back together because i love her .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	the cd ha a very interesting cover . the cover give the impression that this is the way it wa done in the beginning .
0	the beatles i am the walrus is a great song . the soloing of the drum is the best ( in my opinion ) part of the song . the bass is ok and the drum do not make much noise . they make noise and they are not very loud . the bass is very important to this song , because it is the most prominent part of the song . the guitar are a little short and the lyric are not very good . i would give it a 4/5 because the solo of the drum is the best part of the song in my mind .
0	this is a good disc . it is not nearly a good a the keith side discography but it ha one of keiths best guitar solo .

0	she is very good at singing and she wrote some good song . she ha a good voice . she can sing very high . she doe a lot of thing .

1	i love this great song that reminds me of what friend are all about . it is great for listening to while you do other thing . it is easy on the ear but still ha a nice , solid beat .
1	i have to say i like this album a lot . it is a very eclectic mix of rock and pop music . there are a lot of great song and it would make a great soundtrack . i am glad i got it a a gift and i am going to be using it a lot .
1	i am still a jewel fan , but i am not a fan of some of their newer material . i like i am a man , but the disc is just not jewel after all . i can understand the inclusion of i am a bird and i am a man on the new album , but the rest just do not seem like jewel , and they do not seem like jewel at all . it is a waste of my time . i wish the new song were better .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	this is a great new radio show that is easy to enjoy . i love the sound quality , and the song are diverse . it is one of my favorite new radio show .
1	maria houghton is one of the finest vocalist in the history of music . her voice is one of the most powerful and soulful i have ever heard . her song reflect the beauty of life itself . she is simply a genius .
1	this is the best synth-pop album i have ever heard . the song are incredibly catchy , and the production is excellent .
0	this is a bad cd . it wa an unplanned listening to this cd and it made me sick to my stomach . i have never had an unplanned listening to a jewel cd , so i am not sure if that is the problem or if it is some sort of illness caused by the cd .
1	i do not know if this is the only dave clark five song with an intro/outro , but this is the best one .
0	i am a huge fan of the dave clark five . i just love this album , but i do not like the song . i do not like most of their music .
1	i have been listening to this album for a while now and i have to say that i loved it . i never thought i would like this album but i found it really enjoyable and i think it one of the best album of the year . i am a big fan of progressive/avant-garde music and i really like the combination of different style that scott creates . i find it difficult to put my finger on what it is about this album that really caught me and got me thinking . it is not easy to put into word . my favorite are in the pocket , wave of life and aint no future and i love the way he approach traditional jazz in a way that i have never heard anyone do.it is so cool and interesting to me to hear a musician use the past to create new sound and image . i think this album is fantastic and a must have for any jazz fan , whether you are a novice or know a little about the genre .
0	i think you should remove some of her song from your site . i think she is a really nice girl and a great singer but some of her song are a little too repetitive .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

1	i can not help but want to say this is the best album of a christian artist i have heard . i will be buying it more often a time go on . i believe it is a very good album . i can not think of anything to add to it besides the original song i will be there when you call , but i still love it . i also like the rest of the album very much . i do not know why i do not like it more . the lyric are great , i just do not like the music . i still enjoy it , but i just do not like it more than i like the old version of in the name of the lord . however , i have not had this album long enough to really make up my mind . i will try to listen more and more and post my thought after i listen to the album more . thank you !

1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i do not know what this song is about , but it is a good one . it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true lover of music and would listen to all type of music , but he is always looking for a song that brings him closer to god . i think this is one of his favorite .

0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i hate this cd . i do not like to listen to music and this one wa horrible . i do not think i would buy any of your cd
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	love this song , it reminds me of my old girlfriend .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

1	this is a really fun album . it is fun . i do not like how it all sound at the same time . i do not like how the music stop at time . i do like how the music stop at time . i do not like the way that some of the song change during the song . i do not like that some of the song have different instrumentation throughout the song . i do not like that i do not hear the chorus of a song . i do not like that some of the song in the album are only for one listener . i do not like that some of the song are only for one type of listener . i do not like that some of the song are only played live . i do not like that some of the song are only played on certain show only . i do not like that there are only a few song that are played on most of the album . i do not like that some of the song have one or two instrument that play on the track . i do not like that there is no instrumentation on several song . i do not like that some of the song have a lot of vocal on the song . i do not like that some of the song contain more than one vocalist . i do not like that some of the song have a lot more drum and other percussion than guitar and bass . i do not like that there is a lot more percussion in the song than the guitar and bass . i do not like that there is a lot of vocal on many of the song . i do not like that there is a lot of vocal in the song . i do not like that there are a lot of vocal on several of the song . i do not like that the vocal are sometimes hard to hear in the song . i do not like that the vocal are sometimes hard to hear in certain song . i do not like that there are a lot of vocal throughout the album . i do not like that the vocal can vary in volume throughout the song . i do not like that the vocal are sometimes too loud with the audio . i do not like that the vocal can become muffled at time . i do not like that the vocal are sometimes hard to hear at time
1	i really love this song ! i love everything about it : the song itself , the video , the singer , and the chorus .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	this album is soooooooooooooo overrated . i bought this album a few year ago , and i listen to it now . i have a couple album from this band that i like , but this is not one of them . the song are nice , but the lyric are terrible . i can not understand what the song are saying . one of the song they wrote wa funny , but the song wa horrible . i listen to this album and laugh out loud . why ? i do not know , i just can not grasp it .
1	i have been looking for a cd that is suitable for people who do not play instrument ( like myself ) and i found this one . it ha a very nice piano accompaniment . i will keep my eye open for other cd that are suitable for people who do not play instrument .
0	i am kind of tired of hearing this song . it is annoying .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	love this song . i have listened to it several time . i love the song . listen to it !
0	i have been a fan since i first heard the song on the radio . i wanted to be a part of the music industry and a soon a i heard this song , i wa hooked ! so , i decided to buy this cd . i had no idea that the cd wa in the original case and the label wa torn off . i am going to have someone pick up the cd and bring it to me a soon a possible .
1	you guy are awesome . i love this site . i love the variety of music and great band you have . i love the fact that my favorite type of music is always going to be original . i do not like the one that have been remade or re-recorded . i like the one that just get a new life with a new group and a new sound . i really like the way this site is updated . it is always fresh . i like that you get new song from time to time , but always fresh . i like the fact that you have more up and coming band than you have older band . it seems like the newer band are getting a little more exposure . i would like to see new band on this site . but i do not think they are good enough yet . i like the fact that you can find a new band by the name of the band . i love the fact that there is always something new . i do not like to pay for music , so i will definitely be a member of this site from now on .
1	the quality of the music wa excellent ! i had a blast hearing jewel play again ! i am a big jewel fan , and i love her music . she is the greatest ! i wa really expecting this cd to be better than it wa , but to my surprise it wa even better . she is been doing it for so long , and she is so good at it , that i wa surprised . she look like she is in great shape , and she is still got a great voice . i am not a big fan of her playing style , but i thought she wa great on this cd . her playing is very good . i wa surprised that her playing wa better than it wa . i thought her playing wa a little too fast .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	this song wa ok. i have to admit i do not like the lyric that much .
1	the first two track are very good . the great pretender is a very good song about a man who want to be a famous actor , and he can not have any success until he get a job . the vocal on this song is a little too high , and the melody is very good . it is a nice song , but the chorus is so bad that i can not listen to it without thinking about how it should have been a better song . the next song is a little better , but still very bad . you do not know me is a good song about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not know how to get it . the vocal are a little too high for me to enjoy it , but it is a nice song , and the melody is good . the only bad thing about you do not know me is that it ha no chorus . a new kind of love is a good song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date , and he doe not know what to expect . the vocal are a little too high for me , but the melody is nice . i like the song , and i like the fact that this album is about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date .
1	i really enjoy listening to live album and this one is a good one . i enjoyed the song so much more than the album .
0	a lot of good song on here , but there are a lot of really really bad one .
1	the first thing i like to note about this album is the musical quality . it is the highest quality production i have ever heard from r.kelly . i have found myself listening to this album over and over again . when i listen to this album i am not even conscious of what is on the cd . it is all in my head . i like a cd that get to me , i like a cd that is on the top of my list , the quality of this album is something i do not think i will ever get tired of listening to .
1	i think that this is a great cd ! i would like to give this to my choir .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	the song just doe not do it for me .
0	this song is horrible ! it is so bad . i have never liked this song . i hate it . i do not even remember why i liked it a few year ago . i like walk this way better .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this is a real jewel album . i love her album that are all studio recording . this one is the real deal . it is got some of her best song , and some of her best song are on the cd .
0	it is very good , but the first part is a little more annoying than the second part .
0	not really a ballad , but it is a pretty song . it is a good song to sing in the car or to have on the radio . the lyric are very deep and really give you something to think about .
0	this is a live recording from the 1978 tour . the band is crosby , still & nash . the performance is from the tour , and is on the new album .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this is a great album . i love the beatles and this is one of my favorite .
0	i love this album . i wa really disappointed in the cd i purchased in the mail . i am not talking about the cd itself , i am talking about the packaging . i wa really impressed with the artwork on the cd and wa even more impressed with the packaging . it wa all nicely packaged and looked great . the cd and cd case were packaged very well and looked just like the actual cd . the cd wa packaged in a very nice sleeve and the cd case wa packaged in an equally nice sleeve . the cd is all right , it is not perfect . i do not have a lot of complaint about the music , but the packaging wa not up to my expectation . the cd could have been handled more professionally .
0	this is good stuff . i am glad i do not have to listen to this song .
0	i really enjoy this show . it is about a jewish man who try to understand his grandfather by looking at his life . it is a very deep show , and i enjoy the actor very much . i do not know how they go on stage so often . i will not be seeing it again though . i think it wa a great show , but there just wa no energy left in it .
1	this album ha been out for a while and i have listened to it many time , but i do not know anything about it content . i think this album
0	i love this band and i think they are really talented . but this cover is a little too boring . the color of the cover are great , but they are not used to good effect . the background is a little too white with the wrong sound .
1	i did not like the first album , but now that i have heard the second , i really like it . it is a different voice and sound .
1	a good album . i am really a big fan of her and i am glad that she still ha a fan .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	the cd is really good , but her singing is the only good thing about this album .
1	this song is very good and ha great message .
0	this is a very good album .
0	i am a fan of the artist and the music . i did not like the song played this time . it wa just one of the song that were played repeatedly throughout the show . i do not know if it wa because of the song or the fact i wa using itunes on a mac .
0	it is a great song , and you really have to love her voice to not think that she would have a voice like that on stage .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?

1	i found one of the song on the internet called this , i love rock n roll on my mp3 collection . it is a really great song .
1	this is a good album . i like the song on it . i bought the cd because of the song home alone .
0	i think that this album is great . it ha a nice blend of soulful and hard rock . it is really nice to hear that r.kelly ha some talent .
1	praise ! is a worshipful worship album by allan bole . this album is for those who want to worship but are just not sure where to begin . the song are filled with praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , praise , prayer , and worship . the lyric are very well-written , and fit the song . there are a few other song that i will have to give a more in-depth review on , but for now i will say that praise ! is a great worship album and it will take you on a journey .
0	this album is a beautiful album .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	this is not a bad album but not a much a i would have liked . i also do not like that it is a re-recording . it would have been more enjoyable to hear the original .
1	i would like to say that i have been a fan of mr tom wait for some time , and this album ha turned me into one again . i love it ! this is my favorite album by wait . and for the first time , i like a tom wait album that is not a country album . i think this is a great album . and in my opinion , it is the best tom wait album .
0	this is a great song . i thought at first the vocal were a little over the top but then i listened again and realized they were good . i had never heard this version before .
1	if i had to pick one album that i like the best , this would be it . dan
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	good cd . i found it a little cheesy but that is fine .
0	no , my daughter did not like it at all . it wa just so loud and annoying . i think her friend did the same thing .
1	this is a great song and really stand out in the wanya morris genre . it is more of a soul song than a rock song . it is very well done .
1	this is a great song . the music is very nice and the voice is very good . the lyric are very good , too . i think this cd ha a lot of potential .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i have listened to this song for almost 2 year . i enjoy it .
0	i bought it because i liked the cover . i liked it . i would give it a 5 .
1	i agree . this is a very good song that is perfect to sing in church .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is a great song ! i really like the beginning of the song - it really is a guitar
1	this is my favorite song .
0	this album make me want to use this website le . i do not need another artist that ha the same voice and is out there in the music industry . i know there is a lot of talent out there , but this is it for me .
1	this is a great cd player . i bought it a a christmas gift for my wife , and she love it . i had to buy a power adapter to use it with the ipod , and it ha no problem doing that . it is really easy to use and ha a great sound . i would recommend it to anyone .
0	a very good album from a very fine singer . a few of the song are very well done , but overall this is an average album .
1	i love the song and think it is a great song .
1	this is the best album i have heard in a long time .
1	her voice is incredible . i love her singing .
1	i like listening to different type of music while i am driving . i did not know there were different type of car in this world .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	i like this album . the album doe not have any bad song . the only bad thing about this is that the quality of the track is not very good .
1	this song make me smile everytime i hear it . it ha a very positive sound and a different feeling . i wish i had this song on cd so that i did not have to listen to it on the radio .
1	this album is brilliant
1	this song wa included in a class i took at a local church and i thought i would pas it along . since i wa pretty far away from home , i did not get a chance to listen to it , and now i can not get it out of my head .
1	one of the key element in making this album is the use of the sound of silence [ a noted in the note ] to create the contrast between the bright , almost bombastic , sound of the orchestra and the quiet , almost ethereal , sound of the soloist .
1	i wa pleased to see this collection of the dave clark five song . i had been a fan of the group since cecilia and i am happy to have this collection of their old song . i have been buying their cd since the first one in 1964 , and i have been a fan of the dave clark five for a very long time . i have bought many of their cd , but this is the first collection i have seen . i think they will have a lot of fan again with this collection of their old song .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i really like this cd , it is a really fun cd to dance to . the song are all different . i have not listened too much to this cd . i do like it .
0	i wa really disappointed with this album . the lyric were too long , the song were not memorable , and it lacked any musical variety .
0	barbra sounded great , but the song i do not like .
0	i love marie and i hope she can create a more mature , but still very popular , voice . i like mary voice , but i do not like her songwriting , it is boring for me .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	love it !
0	i love this song .
0	i wa disappointed with this song . it had no redeeming quality and all of the lyric were just so stupid .
1	this is an incredibly good cover of a very good song . i had never heard of this band , and i think that is because their song are so good . they also have some very good new material on the cd . i hope you can do a better job of covering the song than i did . i can not believe you just copied and pasted a cover of one of my favorite song and gave it a different title . you are a total douchebag .
1	this is the song that keep me going . i have a friend who is like a kid in the car when he hears this song , it make me laugh .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i wa surprised at how good this one is . i have been a fan of her since her first album , but i have not been able to get her to come out with much . this one is a great song . it is just one of those song that you can not get enough of . it is just one of those song that you can not put enough of .
1	this is cool . this is cool . i like this song .
0	this is another album that is excellent . the original is a great album , but this is the soundtrack to the movie fantastic voyage . the album contains a lot of the music from the movie , including the choral piece and the opening choral prelude .
0	i am a fan of miley cyrus and i really , really want this cd . but it is so hard to get my hand on it .
1	just listen to it and you will know what i mean . it is a lot of fun . i never thought i would say that about a tom scott album , but it wa really refreshing to hear a tom scott album that i can call my own . this is a fun album to listen to . it is not going to take you more than a few minute to get to know the song , but it is a nice listen all the same .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this is a great album , and i have been listening to it for a couple of day now .
0	this wa the first of many . i have listened to the first two dozen song , and i am still not sure if i can listen to any of them . i love the music but it is just not for me . i wish the artist wa more popular .
0	i like that it go fast . it go fast .
0	this cd is very interesting . it ha a lot of different tune . it ha an upbeat beat . i like the fact that the cd ha a tempo of 110. the recording quality is good . it is a country music cd . the lyric are interesting . i like the song i am on my way . it is a country music cd . the instrument is nice . the instrument sound clear and well recorded . the song is a very interesting country music cd . i like the cd . it is a good country music cd .
1	tom wait is a great singer and a great song writer .
1	i really like this cd ! i love the music and the song . the beat are very good also . this is a great album i can add to my collection .
1	this song is an emotional roller coaster . the first couple of time you can hear the song , you will be fine . it is not until the chorus come in that you get turned off . i wa very turned off by the lyric . i find it very insulting when someone think they can get away with what they did . i just do not agree with it . i do not think you should have to apologize for your action . you do not have to forgive anyone for what they have done to you . i think it is very important to let the other person know what you thought of them . even if it is a song . even if they are a complete jerk . just tell them you just do not agree with what they did . it doe not make you right , but it doe not make them wrong either . just know what you think . i love the way it is written . you do not have to sing it , it is just one of my favorite .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this song is about how he feel when she is cheating on him . the song is also about how he feel when he is sleeping with someone that he doe not really care about .
1	i think this song is great . it is not offensive and the lyric are very beautiful .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	this album ha a great mixture of classic rock and pop music . i love the singer and her music . i hope we get to see them on stage soon .
0	she is good at singing . she can do a lot of thing . she can sing , but her voice is not that good .
1	i have been listening to this set for a couple of week and the disc have been in perfect working order . i like the music . i like the playing . if you are a jazz fan , you will like this . that is why i went ahead and bought it .
1	i really like this song . i just bought it to give to my sister . she really enjoys it .
0	i bought this cd and it is great , but i am disappointed with the song are so similar . especially the last two song . i do not see why they had to do a cover .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i bought this cd from amazon , it wa a good christmas present . the song are really good . the only problem is that my ipod will not play the cd . the cd is scratched on it so when you turn it on the sound will start coming out of the speaker and then it will stop . i hope that i will be able to transfer the cd to another player and then maybe it will work .
1	great album , great song . one of my favorite song is god love which ha a great message about how god love u and that he is always with u . other favorite include holy and behold . i am not sure why the title is inspirational . it is simply a great album . if you like christian music this is the album for you . there is some good music here but it is not a great album .

1	i have been a fan of sam sparro since i first saw his performance on american idol back in 2002. i wa impressed by his vocal range and his smooth and effortless delivery of song that were not only extremely well-crafted , but also were very emotional .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .

1	this is a great album , and so are the song .
0	i really do like this song . it is very catchy .
1	this new release is more like what i have come to expect from jewel . this is not to say it is a bad cd . the vocal are amazing . it is just that i have come to expect too much from her . the song i do like are more of the same ; i will just get used to them .

1	i love it ! i like it a lot . i like how she sings it . it ha a good beat , and the song is great .

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	the song is great . the video is horrible .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	this album is one of my favorite by prince . i like the melody of his song , and the harmony are great . i do not really like his album that have the same track listing a his previous one , but this is far from it . this is the only song that prince played on his first solo tour , and i love it . even though the song is not amazing , the beat is fantastic , and that is what i love most about prince . prince wa always an artist that had a great voice and a great songwriting .
1	i do not know if i have enough positive thing to write here . i love this song . i like the lyric .

1	i do not know what to say about this collection . i bought three . i have loved and followed the music for a long time .
1	this is a very good song . i agree with previous review , however , the video wa boring .
1	this is a very good radio show .
1	prince greatest hit is absolutely amazing ! it is the best prince album i have ever heard and i am pretty sure it will be the best prince album of all time .
1	for a christmas gift it wa very disappointing . the song are good and the cd play well .
1	this album wa the first album i ever bought , the beatles are amazing . i have all their album and this is one of my favorite .
0	i am not sure who this singer is , i have not met her in person , but this album is pretty terrible . the vocal are terrible , the music is terrible , the lyric are terrible . it is just the whole album is terrible , it is like listening to the soundtrack of someone el movie . i would rather listen to the soundtrack of someone el movie than listen to this album . to be fair , this is a very good singer , it is just that she is not very good . to make thing worse , it is not a bad album , it just not very good . it is very good for the most part , but it is not good at all . there are a few good song on here , but the album a a whole is awful .
0	i am a big fan of tom scott . this wa my first time buying his music . it is really interesting . it is just a really bad song . this song is one of the worst song i have ever heard . i have had a hard time listening to it . it is really depressing . i wish i had written a negative review . i do not know why i did not . i wish i did . i would give him a 10 .

0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this is a good song to listen to on the way to the gym or after a hard workout .
1	i think it is a great song .
1	this is a really good song . i enjoyed it very much . it is the story of a christmas carol . the music is great . it is very soft and is pleasant to listen to . i am very happy with this . this is the third song on the album . i give it 5 star .
1	this is not a cd of instrumental music , but an album of song . the song are arranged by john williams , who won a grammy in the 70 . the recording are made on a 78 rpm record with stereo . this is one of the most popular album of williams career .
0	i think i have seen this song before . it wa on a cd album that i bought at walmart . i do not remember what it wa called , and i do not have a name for it , but it wa a cd album with the song on cd . i am not sure if any of the song on that album sound familiar .
0	after the dave clark five last album , the cd contained a song called i am dreaming of a white world . i liked it when they did it , but i think it is a bit corny now . it is too bad they had to take it off the cd .
1	this is a great cd . i am glad i bought it . i have learned a lot of song . i will probably buy more thing from amazon . i have always been satisfied with my purchase from amazon . in fact , i have never had a bad experience at amazon .
0	this song played at the end of the episode the boy who cried wolf . this song wa played a a background music when gob wa going to get lost in the wood . it is pretty . i would like to listen to more than a few second of it .
0	this song is from the movie the rocky horror picture show . but it is not the same song a on film , so you are going to have to listen to the movie to know what i am talking about .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i have not heard this before , but it is very slick and enjoyable .

0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i have had this cd for a couple year now and have been really into it . i like it a lot . it is really good . there is a song called a beautiful morning in the song list , but it is not on the cdr . i liked the song , but it wasnt on the cd . i think i will get the cd .
0	you are gon na be very disappointed with this album . this album is not even in the same ballpark a the album that you should be listening to .

1	i am the guy that bought it from the original owner and i have been listening to it for a
0	the music of this album always make me feel a sense of pride , joy and wonder of the world . there is always a great message , and a deep love for a great person who ha inspired you .
1	i think this song is a great one , but i can not find it on the cd of the show . i think i am going to put it on mine .
1	this album had some great song but i did not like the one that i love more than word . so i do not understand why there is not more song like this on the radio .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this cd is not for me . the only song i could stomach wa mama , i am coming home . i am a big fan of r.kelly , but this is not his best album . it is a little rough . i do not have much of a problem with the lyric ( i think that is r.kellys issue ) . but , the music is not his best . it doe not have that piano sound . it ha a little bit of a jazzy sound to it . also , the tempo is a little fast , which i do not like . the first few song are very fast , which i found distracting . also , it is an album that is almost one-note - you can not really tell what song it is , you know . the only one that i could get into wa mama , i am coming home . it is a very good song though .
0	i have listened to this one twice and i wa disappointed . this is an album that should have been released in 2000. it is not a very strong album that i would recommend at all .
1	i love this album . i have had it for about a month or two now . it wa a gift from my boyfriend . he had it on a digital player and i put on the cd . it sound great . i would recommend this album to anyone who love music . it would be a good choice for a birthday gift . it also ha great lyric . i would recommend this album to anyone who like hip-hop . the lyric are very good . i enjoy this album very much . i like the beat and i like the music too . i love this album . i love this album . i love this album . this is a very good hip-hop album . it ha great lyric , great vocal , and a great beat . this is a very good hip-hop album . i like it a lot . i think it is great .
0	i like the movie version too much . i can not find this version on the cd of the movie .
0	miley ha a great voice .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	it is only a cd , but it is a good recording . this is a live gig , not a radio broadcast . it is just a cd and not a cd . it is a live recording . i do not know if i can give a good review but i will say that this is a good live recording from a live concert . it is not a radio broadcast because it is not broadcast . it is just not broadcast .

1	it is pretty hard to explain what my opinion of r.kelly is , but i think that he is an artist that will grow on you . i have been listening to his music since he wa
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i recently purchased this in order to hear jp play . i am disappointed . the guitar playing is fine , but the song writing is not appealing to me . the song spark is really uninspiring . the music is good , but the lyric are not all that interesting . this doe not sound like the type of music jp usually play - i am disappointed . i will no longer support jp .
0	it is a lot harder than it look . for me , it is not much of an album . i have a hard time finding any of the song i like .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i wa surprised and very happy to find out that david lee roth ( a.k.a . david lee roth ) and the dave clark five ( dvcf ) will be doing a new year eve concert at the hollywood bowl . i wa surprised that the singer of the band is a fan of my voice . i ’ m glad that he liked my voice and that he invited me to see them live . i ’ m glad that i wa able to see them in concert . i ’ m glad that david lee roth and the dave clark five are doing a concert . i ’ m glad that i ’ m able to see them live and hear their music .

1	i think this is the best whitney houston album and a true classic . it is one of my favorite whitney houston album .
0	very well remade by him . i have to say that he wa very good in his own way . there is no comparison to his original .
0	i wa very excited about this cd because i know that many people who have played it have had great experience with it . however , i wa disappointed by the cd because i have played it many time and i have had a very peaceful experience playing this cd . i have listened to it for over an hour , and i have not had any experience with it that were negative . it is very slow . so slow that i could not understand what the lyric were . the lyric that are on this cd are very sad .
1	loved this song ! i bought it for my mom . she is a little deaf and she could not hear it at first . but once she heard it , she loved it . i would play it for her when i had to go out of town on business . she loved it too ! i hope someday i can get the cd for my dad who is deaf too .

1	this is the first cd i have heard by the band . i am enjoying it , but am still not 100 % sold on it . the original music is a bit too rock for me , but i am not sure i understand what the original lyric mean . i am hoping for something more mature , but i do not really know what else to expect . i did enjoy some of the original song that they did in the movie , although they are not a well done a the movie version . i will try to post an update after i have listened more and more . i also like the new caught up and came to know you that ha been added to the cd . i hope this cd catch on . thank you , and i will try not to have negative review .

1	i have been a jazz fan since my childhood and i have listened to tom scott cd before . i want to give this one 5 star .
0	this album is one of the best trance album . i think this album is great . it is a good album , not great .
0	not my favorite cash song , but i have heard of it and i like it .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is one of the best trance album that i have ever listened to . i love the sound and feel of the music . i love the overall quality of the music . the overall sound and feel of the music is great . the only real problem i have with this album is the fact that there are a couple of track that i do not think are very good . i just do not like song that are just filler . other than that , i think this is one of the best trance album that i have ever listened to .
1	this is a nice little set that will take you back to the day of the original vinyl . it ha a nice balance of music and the feel of listening to a real gramophone . a a good friend of mine said , it sounded like the real thing !
0	this song is so good i am not sure how to describe it . i can not get enough of it . i recently bought the entire artpop album because i could not decide which song to keep . i love all of them but this song is simply amazing .
1	this is a very good album . i think it is the best one made so far .
1	this is the only true song i have ever sung , because i wa never blessed to have a father like the one in this song . it brought me a lot of joy

0	this album is excellent ; the vocal are average , the music is good , and the band is good . this album ha a good sound , but the vocal are not great .
0	a great show , well worth the money , but the sound is awful . i have been going to the theater since 1969 , but i have never heard a show where so many of the character were so horrible .
1	these track were originally written for a new project , but later i ended up reusing them for this album . i think that the song are enjoyable and have a nice rhythm to them . the lyric are very good and the music is excellent . the album is recommended for those who like good music with a good message .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this is one i have been waiting to hear for a long time . i love the song and the artist .
1	i love it when a song make me think of a movie or a movie i want to make . this song doe exactly that .

1	it is barbra streisand singing this song . i like listening to her sing . it is a good song , but it is hard to < strong > hear < /strong > < strong > . < /strong > it is the way she sings , and it is not just a cover , but it is a great cover . it is a great song . i like listening to her sing . it is a very nice song . i like listening to barbra streisanda < strong > sing < /strong > . it is a good song . i like listening to barbra streisand sing .
0	this album wa a little disappointing . there is some great song , but the album is lacking in some area , it is a little bland for my taste , but with all the great song it could not be any better .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i like this radio show . it is really good .
1	this song and the other song in the i believe in jesus playlist are both excellent worship song . the lyric are very brief and simplistic , but the music is very powerful .
0	i do not like this song , but i like the music in it . it is a good song and it is a real nice song , but my problem with it is that it is over produced and over done . i do not know where most of the good music is coming from , there are no original idea , it is just music that is been done so many time it doe not sound new anymore . this song is over produced and is over played by about 2:00 in . it is a song that is been done so many time it is no longer new , it is almost old . i do not like this song , it is one of the oldest song i have heard yet and it sound like most of the song i have heard today . i do not know why they did this , but it is just something i do not like . this is one of the worst cd that i have listened to all year . it is something i have to listen to , but i do not think i will ever listen to it again .
0	i also love that it is a compilation of song , so if you want to buy this all in , then you are a fool . i love this album .

1	i have this recording on cd . this is one of karajans best recording , and the best recording of karajans the world is waiting for the sunrise .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i think this album is underrated . it is very fun and very listenable . the lyric are quite clever and the harmony are amazing . i have a hard time listening to the first few song because they are so short . i usually listen to the entire album in one shot . i love it .
0	this is a nice album . it ha some interesting part , but the only song that ha potential is moonlight serenade and that only last for 2 minute , and the rest is very repetitive . i think the album would have been better if the song were longer , and there wa more variety . the most positive thing about this album is the quality of the sound , especially the vocal . the only thing negative about this album is the song are too short .
1	i like this album a lot , especially the last one .
0	i bought this cd when i heard it on the radio . i bought it in hope it would help me fight the depression . it did not . it did nothing to help me . it did not bring me joy . it did not make me happy . it only made me feel worse .
1	it is very sad and depressing . it is a very sad song . but it is very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a very , very good song . i have never sung a sad song before , but i have never sung a song in this way . the lyric are very powerful .

1	i really enjoyed this album . i love it !
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

1	i am a novice song writer and have not yet written anything worth hearing . this is the first of many mediocre song , but i am going to try to write a song that is worthwhile . in addition to i like the way that you are singing . i would like to write something that say i like the way you sing . in addition to that , i would like to write something that state i like the way that you sing . and i would like to write something that say i like the way that you sing .
0	what a wonderful life by dolly parton . this wa purchased for my niece for christmas and i am glad i did . the song are great and the cd is very enjoyable . however , the packaging is so poor that i have returned it . the cover is ugly , the cd is loose , the sleeve are so dirty that i have asked for them to be returned . the cd is $ 14.95 . i am so disappointed with the cd . i have already returned the $ 14.95 . i am only on my 4th cd . i have been on the internet to find this cd on some site . i had to email the company to ask the price . i will never buy another cd from them again . i am sorry , i am very disappointed .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	this is a very good cd . the song are very long and have a slow tempo which give the listener a good opportunity to listen without being bored . the lyric are very interesting and have a great message . i listen to her voice on this disc and i think she is a great singer and i think this is the best album she ha ever made . she ha been keeping her talent under wrap for quite a while now and she is getting better and better . i suggest everyone listen to this album . it is not a jazz concert . it is a very good concert . she is a good singer . i hope she keep making these cd . i also hope she will keep making movie .
1	i have to agree with the general consensus , but i think the movie wa better .

0	this is one of the worst reo speedwagon album i have ever heard . i am not familiar with the other member of reo speedwagon , but this is one of their very worst album . i do not know why i even own this album . i have to say it is a good album , but i can not imagine any song on this album being on any other album .
1	i discovered this band during a trip to europe and i just love the song of this band . the song are very nice .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i have it in my car , but i can not get it out of my head . it is probably the best album i have ever heard .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	kid will love this app , and parent will enjoy it too .
0	this cd is fantastic . the song are good . the music is great . i would not listen to this cd again . i have two problem with this cd . the first problem is that the lyric can be a bit misleading . the second problem is that it is a bit annoying and doe not flow like most christian music . i am not sure what the second problem is . i do not think either of the problem is a problem with the cd . the music is good and the lyric are good . i like that the song are christian . they are good christian song that i like and would enjoy listening to again , but i do not think that this cd is appropriate for everyone . i think that this cd is better suited for a christian home-group or for a church .

0	i like this song though . it ha a nice groove and i like the sound . but i do wish they had some music credit on the cd .
1	this album wa great , except for the music . i guess this wa the first ohearn album i purchased , and i hated it . it wa a very long album , and with all the talking and singing , it wa hard to listen to .
1	i have been listening to prince music for a long time , and i have enjoyed listening to his other album but i really think the album entitled the hit is the best that he ha done . this album ha a very old school feel to it without sounding like a bad remix of an old school artist . i would definitely recommend this to anyone who love prince and his music .

1	i listen to this song over and over , and i feel relaxed , happy and just plain awesome when i listen to it .
0	i enjoy the fact that the song is still catchy . i usually like to hear a song that ha some sort of theme or message that can be used in different situation . this song ha that . i like the simplicity of the song , and i love the fact that the song doe not try to be all over the place . it is very easy to remember . i like the fact that it is a song that will keep me going through a rainy day . i guess it is more of a rainy day anthem than anything else , though . i like the harmony in this song . i like the use of different instrument . i am a big fan of the guitar and the drum . i even liked the bass and the snare drum , a they were nice and lively . i would not expect all of the instrument in the song to be there in the original recording , but i like the fact that they are . i would like to see this song performed live in a bigger way . i would like to see the band play this song with some more energy . it is a song i would like to see live , but it is not a good live band that i want to see play this song .
0	i wish i felt like watching this video . i have never heard this song before and just wanted to listen to it . this is a fantastic song and video .

1	i am a fan of trance , and i have to say this is by far the most impressive trance album that i have ever heard . it is very enjoyable , and i like the way the vocal are mixed in there so that they seem to be coming from all part of the song . this is a very good album .
1	tom scr . tom scott is very well worth the price of admission .
0	this song is great ! i have seen it used in all sort of show , but never saw it used in a show .
0	this song ha been stuck in my head so many time , i never thought i would ever buy it . i have heard it about a million time on the radio . i had a family member die , so i purchased the download for him . it wa really hard to listen to .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

0	the lyric to this are great . there is a lot of meaning in the lyric .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i have not heard of this artist before purchasing this album but i am glad i found this album . the album is good , but i would have liked to hear some more song of the same artist .
0	this is the best jazz album of the decade .
0	i think the first thing i thought of when i heard this song wa the word all by myself and i thought that wa funny .

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this song will make you feel good , and you will be happy .
1	this is a great song , and the piano is great .
0	i have several cd of reo speedwagon and one of the cd is i am so lonesome sung by the band . it ha very little sound , almost no bass or drum . it is a little depressing . i have another cd of the same band i will be right there that ha better sound . i like the sound better . it is a little more positive . i have heard a lot of cd and i have never heard this one before . i wish the author would write a review on his cd .
0	this is my first time buying something from amazon . i have been a fan for many year and have been purchasing all kind of item from them . i wa very happy to find this compilation of ansermets recording . i would highly recommend it to anyone who love ansermet or classical music in general . the playing is fantastic and the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined the experience for me , but that can be expected with a compilation of the recording .
1	i just recently found this cd in my dad music collection . i loved the fact that it wa a true grateful dead album , complete with a full orchestra , and a drumline . what a treat , and i would highly recommend this cd to any fan of the grateful dead .
1	i never noticed this song . i do not really listen to this album , but i love the song .
0	this album is very well produced , and i do not know why i am not more impressed . i suppose i should be . the album is very well produced and ha a good sound . i just do not think that it is very good . the song actually sound very generic , and i do not know why it is so hard for them to write good song . there is no reason why it should be so hard for them to do that . not even the beatles need to write good song . they can write just a good song a any other band . the beatles should be able to write good song . but the only song that are written well are all you need is love and i wan na hold your hand . those two song are very repetitive , and really boring . and the rest of the song are just boring . i would say that there are maybe five great song on here . of those five , two are hey jude and all you need is love , and the rest are just okay . that is a shame because i like to think that there wa some genius going on here .
1	i loved this album . i love this album . i have been a fan since day one .
0	a good song . the vocal are very good and the tempo is very nice and smooth for the first 10-15 second of the song . then it slows down so you do not get distracted . i like this song .
1	i have always liked steve morse . he is one of the best vocalist around for a long time . he is a great song writer and he is a great performer .
0	one of the more popular album on the label . i like the arrangement of the song . there are many song that sound alike . the album is very accessible . i like the production . i think that most jazz musician would like this album .
1	i have been listening to this song on repeat for the past month . it is my new favorite . i love the lyric .
1	i have been waiting for the cd for so long . i have listened to it many many time .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	this song really lift me up and i do not know how i can ever listen to another song that make me feel this way .
1	i am not a fan of any reo speedwagon release . i have never bought a cd from them . i have not listened to them in a while . i am sure they will be back . if you are looking for an album that ha good song , i would suggest this one . i will listen to it , but i am not a fan of it . it wa not my favorite album . i am not a fan of their music at all .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i like this song .
1	i heard this song and it is sooo good , but i am not sure if i want to give it a try . i am not a fan of mileys music , but this one is good , and i want to hear it more .
0	i like it ! i like lorde .
0	i really do not care for this song . i did not want to buy it , and i did not listen to it .
1	jon lord is one of the most gifted songwriter , but he ha never had a great album a a band . this is a great album , but i have to question how many great album did they record . one album is not going to make a great album . this is a great album that i will listen to again and again .
0	this song need a little more emotion in the instrumentals to make it a little more enjoyable .
0	this album is a collection of song that have an important message for both the church and general society . the song are written from the perspective of a christian , and they are an attempt to create a positive world . the song are all about love and the positive experience that come along with it . the song themselves are very much about the positive experience that we have while in relationship with our spouse , parent , child , friend , and in general throughout most aspect of our life . this album ha not been made with any religious purpose in mind . it is simply a collection of song that have been written to bring about a positive message .
0	i love the album , but i do not understand why so many people hate it . it really is not what i expected , but i love it , and the most hated part is the music .
1	just a song by the r kelly group . this song is not good for the radio , so if you are looking for something to listen to , then i suggest you avoid this song . in fact , this song is not even good for the club . this song is not good for the radio or the club . this song is just a song by the r kelly group - the same song that is on the radio . the song is not good for the radio , so if you like the radio , then i suggest you avoid this song . this song is not good for the club . this song is not good for club . this song is not good for the club . this song could be a good song if used in a movie , but it is not good for the radio . this song is not good for radio . this song is not good for the radio . this song is not good for club radio . i do not like this song . this song is not good for radio or club radio . this song is not good for the radio . this is a typical r. kelly song . i dislike this song . this is not good for the radio . this is not good for the radio . this is not a good song . this song is not good for radio or club radio . this song is not a good song . this song is not good for the radio . this song will not play on a radio . this song is not good for the radio . this could be a good song if used in a movie , but it is a bad song for the radio and not for club radio . this song is not good for radio . this song is so generic . this is not a good song for the radio . this is not good for the radio . the song sound like a sam sparro song , but it is not a good sam sparro song . this song is not good for the radio . this is not a good song for the club . this song is not good for club . the song sound like a r kelly song , but it is not a good r kelly song . this song is not good for the club . this is not a good song for the radio . this song is not a r kelly song ! this is not good for the club . this is not a good song . this is not a good song for the radio . this could be a good song if used in movie , but it is not a good song for the radio . this is not good , but it is better than the song i wish i wa your lover . this is not good for the radio , but it is good for the club . this song is not good for the club . this is not a good song to
1	i always thought it wa kind of odd that this song wa sung by a woman . but i guess that is what i wanted to hear . this song is about a man who ha lost all hope of happiness . he say that he is a miserable bum . he ha lost all the thing that he wanted in life , he ha lost all the thing that he loved . he think that his life is over . that is when the song start . he think that his life is over , so his wife try to cheer him up . and he say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick around . and his wife say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick you around . this is a very touching song . it is about a man who ha lost all hope of happiness . he say , i have got a brand new ball of joy to kick . and his wife say , i have got a brand new ball to kick you around . this is a very touching song . it is full of hope and happiness . it is full of joy and it is full of love and peace . this is probably one of my favorite christmas song of all time .
0	this is an excellent collection of music from the 1960s . the musicianship is great and the song are very good . i think this is a great collection .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	i am glad there is a better way of telling god so that he can bless me .
1	i do not normally like this band , but this song ha a lot of energy and is a pretty good rockin song .
0	i thought the album wa good . not one song wa really all that good .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	this album had all the right ingredient for it to become one of the greatest .
0	this is the first of two disc i bought , the other being the double-cd version of out of step . now , there are a lot of people who have bought both , and i have been told that the double-cd version is superior , so i am using the first disc , but i wish it wa more .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	this one wa the worst of the cd i have bought . i would just like to let you know that i have never ordered this cd and i can not believe you wrote a review of it . i would like to hear it but i can not stand the song and the vocalist .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	it wa on the cd that wa given to me a a gift , i do not know how to put into word .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	she can sing , but her voice is no good . she sings like a soprano and all her song are in the lower register . i do not like that .
1	i love this song .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i have seen this album on many tv program and i have never been disappointed . the album ha some great song and prince is one of the best artist in the world .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	this is a classic rock song .
1	i bought three 1/3 cd of this band from amazon . i want to buy more cd . i wish i can buy more cd . i like the cd that come with the cd .
1	this is a very
1	i am a fan of this site . the best thing about this site is the music . i love the fact that most of the song are original . it is great to see a site with original song . i did not have time to listen to all the song on this site , but i came across some great artist in the process of listening to the song . you guy rock !
0	i had the song oh boy sung to me by my high school choir teacher . i loved it so much that i asked him to write a song for me . he came up with this song and asked me if i would sing it to him . i said yes , and he recorded it for me .
0	i like mary singing better than mary personality .
0	i have listened to this cd many time . the music is pretty good . the lyric are not very interesting . the solo are pretty good . i bought this cd in order to hear jp play . i am disappointed . the music is good , but the lyric are not very interesting , and the solo are pretty good . i will no longer support jp .
0	this is the worst live album i have ever heard . the band is not very good and the recording is horrible . it is a waste of time . i hope to see this band in the future . i will not buy it again .
1	this is my second favorite song in the whole album . i like the song , but this is by far the best version of it .
1	i think this song rock .
0	i wa disappointed with this album . i like his earlier work and this is not a good . there are no new song and just repeated song . when this wa first released , i thought it wa the best work he ha done so far . the album is not one of the best i have ever heard , but it is not bad . it is nice to have good song like the one above , a well a the next song , we are always together .
0	i like the song , and the music is very good . i bought this cd to make a cd for my car .
1	i love the music of this band , it is so clean and yet there is also a deep bass and dark organ riff that make you feel like you are in a desert . very nice .
0	i like this song , but it is not a happy song . it is just a song for a christmas party . i would not buy it .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	sam sparro ha written a very good song . it is a very nice mix of american and japanese culture and is very catchy . sam sparro is a talented singer , and he is got to know his own music . sam sparro is very talented , but is he talented enough to write good song ?
1	i thought this song wa a good one . this is a nice tune .
0	it is really good , but i do not like this song .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i did download this song . the song is not playing on my iphone . it say this song is not supported in this device .
1	this song mean a lot to me and i really like it .
0	i bought this album a a gift for my daughter . i do not like the song , heart in motion , the only issue i have with the album is that the song seems to be a feel good song for the average person . i thought that the album would be much more interesting if it had a song that dealt with more of a more negative view of thing . i have been listening to the christian music that i listen to all of my life . it took me a long time to find the music that i love . i used to listen to a lot of christian music , but a i got older , i started to listen to more rock music . i have been listening to a lot of christian rock music , and i really like it . i do not know if i should say it or not , but , i think that the tom scott band is a rock band and not a christian band . a such , i find that i do not like most of their song that are written from a christian point of view . i like the song that they do have song that are written from a christian point of view .
0	this is my 1st cd of hers . i loved on the first one i ordered . i am hoping she will return to this one .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	she is a great singer .
1	i love the song on this album . they are very well sung , and the songwriting is excellent . i have listened to this album a lot , and it definitely an excellent album .
0	i love her song . this song is good . it is a good song . i hope the album is better .
1	this is an absolutely gorgeous album , a well a a very good song . it is also the first album that i own by the band that i have listened to for every song . i do not think i have ever bought an album by a band that i have listened to every song on . i had to buy this one , because i wanted to hear sweet jane and you do not know me .

1	i found a song on the internet called i will be home before christmas it wa a very happy song .
0	i think the singer is very talented and i like the song .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	it is a little bit of a let down a compared to the others , but not a bad effort . it is a good song , but some of the lyric are a little harsh .
0	this is a very good album . i enjoyed it very much .
0	this is probably the best radio show i have ever heard .
0	i like this song . the movie is good too . i am just going to say it is the worst song ever . it is just two chord and it is not good .

1	i bought this cd because i love the song , and i also like the cd cover art .
1	i have to say , this is the only song i can sing along to . this is very nice and a great song . i have always loved this song . this would make a great worship song .
0	i loved the song but i do not think it wa the best song . the lyric are very generic . she sings , sings , sings , sings , sings , sings , sings , sings , and sings , but it just is not the best song .
0	i do not understand the dislike of the album . i have no problem with the sound quality or the song . i just do not understand the dislike . i think this album is a great collection of song .
1	i like this cd . it is a good mix of song . the song you make my heart sing is a good one . i do not know how i can say it like this , but you make my heart sing is my favorite song . i like the other song . overall , i would recommend this cd .
1	d clark five is the first cd i have of the beach boy . i have only heard the cd once before . i love the song and i love dave clark . his song are great . the beach boy are one of the greatest rock and roll act of all time and this cd ha great song from the beach boy .

1	i just downloaded this song . i can not believe it is free ! it is a very good song . i would recommend it !
1	this album made me want to use this website le

1	i have been really enjoying the jewel song of late . i have only been listening to her since she released her first album a a solo artist . it is rare that a major artist release a solo album and i feel jewel ha a gift for writing and arranging . i highly recommend this album .
0	the vocal are ok , this song is alright .
0	the song is upbeat . the melody , though , is not pleasant . in fact , i would say this is one of the worst song i have ever heard .
1	i am so glad that i bought this new album . i love e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time !
0	i love the beginning of this song and the lyric . it is very catchy .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .

1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a few day now and find that i enjoy it very much . i have had the cd for about 2 week now . i have listened to it on my mp3 player and my walkman . it is a very good album .
1	i received a cd titled live at the roxy in the mail today , and i could not be happier . it is a great live recording of the who in concert on sunday , september 22 , 1985. it is a little sloppy , but overall a great performance . the sound quality is superb and the performance is a pleasure to listen to .
1	this album is a good album , and i like some of the song better than others , but the album is so much better than the previous album . this album is great , and i like it better than the previous album . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	i love this song and all the version . this one is great . i think this version is a little more powerful than the other version i have . i think it is one of the best cover there is .
1	this is a really great song . it is a great song , but the vocal just do not work for me in this version . the song is very short at about 1 minute , so the vocal do not fit . i think that the song would get better if it wa longer .
1	this is a lovely arrangement of the song . the best part is the instrumentation and the harmony . the lyric are also excellent . i have not yet figured out how i am going to explain to my 6 and 7 year old child that this is a lullaby .
1	the whole cd is incredible . it is truly an incredible collection .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	this cover is great . it is not a parody , it is not a tribute , it doe not rip off , it is not a cover , and the song is amazing . the original is better , but this one is absolutely beautiful . if it is not available in your country , go buy the original or any gnr album to hear this cover or listen to the original version on youtube .
1	awesome ! i listened to it while my husband wa watching a movie , and i can not tell you how good it made me feel . i would love to have more of her stuff .

0	tom wait is a hard act to follow . i used to listen to his music on repeat . i wa a big fan . i wa disappointed to find out that he wa involved in a recording that wa going to be released in the near future . i do not like the sound of that . it reminds me of the sound of an old cassette tape with no sound . although it doe not really matter because tom wait can never be replaced . he is a legend .
1	i did not know that i needed to know a few thing about music before i could listen to this album . however , i do . this is a well-crafted album that , for me , wa the first of it kind . the song are very good , the production is excellent , and the lyric are very well-written .

0	very good recording for the money .
1	this collection is a great set for the classical music lover . i have been wanting to purchase this set but every time i have tried to do so , the price ha not been right . i finally decided that i would buy it only if the price wa right . now it is . the set is a wonderful collection . i can understand why it would cost so much but the quality of the sound is fantastic . a a matter of fact , i would rate this set a one of the best cd i have ever heard . i would recommend this set to anyone who like classical music .
0	it is just a generic love song with a great beat .
1	this is a really sweet song and i love the lyric . it is also an older song and i think it is a good choice for the theme of the album .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this wa an okay album . it wa a little too long and not very interesting . i like the song and the cover art is nice , the production is decent , and the playing is okay . i can not really say that the album is bad , but it is not a great a the other disc . i can not wait for the next one .
0	this album is terrible . i have no interest in the album of any other band ; this is my only reo speedwagon album . i have to hand it to them , they are an incredibly talented group . the song are good , and i liked the album overall . i do not know why i even own this album . i have a couple of other album by them , one of which is by far my favorite . but i do not think it is a good album .
1	this cover song is alright . it is a cover band . i will check the rest of the song .

0	i think this is a really good collection of music . i have the first six on cd . it is a good collection . i think this is a really good collection of music .
0	it is just a song . it is not really a song , it is just a video .
0	very disappointing . i am not a jewel fan at all , but you are right , this song is terrible . it is a boring song which just keep repeating itself . i liked when she wa talking about her father in the first song . she ha a very nice voice and i would like to hear her sing a few song more . i do not know if i can get behind this album . i love all her other album , but this one is just so boring to me . i hope she get back with her boyfriend .
1	i love this song . i think it is one of the best song of the year . i bought the cd in 1999 , and even though it took me a few year to get it , i always thought it would be a hit . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard the song played on a radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio today , i could not believe it . i really love it . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard it played on a radio . so when i saw it come up on the station today , i wa like ohhhhhh and put it on my cd . very excited .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i downloaded the mp3 from amazon and i like it better than state of trance 2008. it ha a little bit of emotion to it and is very melodic . the way the song end is to die for !
0	i like this album , and i think it is a good one .
0	i wa excited to listen to this cd . i love the song , a good heart is a good heart is a good heart is a good heart . i wa expecting a good cd . it just doe not live up to the hype . i could not understand the word . i could not understand why this cd wa so hyped up . i could understand that the cd wa so hyped up , but i could not understand why it wa so hyped up .
0	this song is so bad i can not even find the lyric in the lyric to tell you what the song is about .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is a great album . i wa pleasantly surprised by the album . it ha a catchy , fast tempo with a ton of energy . the song are well written and have an amazing arrangement . i would also give it an 8/10 because the lyric are not a strong a i like but they are still great . i will be purchasing this album for sure !

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i just love the beatles . i wa introduced to them by my brother-in-law , who actually life with them and ha been their manager for many year . he introduced me to their music , and i am still a fan to this day . my favorite beatles album is their album sgt . pepper lonely heart club band . i also love the other beatles album that come out ( like please please me and yellow submarine ) but i have not yet gotten around to buying them .

0	this song is amazing ! it really is one of the best song ever .
0	this song suck , but the video is cool .
0	this is a good album . but it should be called allan bole : the secret song of jewel . if you listen to the song millionaire there is a song called slim that is sung by a man . the two song are about the same thing but not the same .
0	a very nice song . the instrumentation is also very good and the vocal are fine for this song . the song is very cool and the instrumentation is cool .
0	the only positive thing about this song is that it ha a very nice tune .
1	this is great jazz music . i love the dorham recording and the complete dixieland story on cd .
0	i am an artist . i use to be a full time musician . i would go to my gig , stand in the back and sing to the crowd . i sang jesus love me . i would make up my own lyric . i would go to my gig , with my guitar . i would stand there and sing it and no one would even know . it wa such a simple song . the crowd would just sing it in unison . they would not even know . i would then go stand in the back and play the guitar . i would play a different melody . i would sing a different melody , for each song i would play . i would go to a different church . i would sing different line . i would sing different song . when i would go back home , i would tell my family , i do not remember what i sang last night but i know in my heart that i sang that song . i would tell them what song i had played . i would tell them where i had played them . i would tell them the word to the song . i would tell them what i had done . i would tell them what i wa going to do next . after i had done all i could do , i would go to bed and sleep . the next day , i would wake up and tell my family , i played that song last night . i sang it , i played it . i do not remember what i sang , but the word are in my heart . i would tell them what i had done the day before . i would tell them what i wa going to do next .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this song reminds me of the old hymn we used to sing in church . it is a very good song to listen to on a plane
1	i have one more sam sparro album to listen to before moving onto something else , so this one i would like to keep . i bought it because i thought it would be interesting to find a sam sparro album with a more contemporary sound . i have listened to this album many time , and i find myself listening to it again and again .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i love this song !
0	i love the music of the 50 and 60 . it is the most important time in history . this is not a bad album . i just did not like it . there is nothing redeeming about this album . it is too short . i am not a fan of 50 and 60 music . it is not even close to the sound that the music should have .

0	i do not like the dave clark five at all . i do not like their music , and i do not like their current discography . they have been a real disappointment . i do not like their music , and i do not like what they are doing with their music now . i have bought every dave clark five album i could find , because i wanted the music . i do not like their current music , and i do not like what they are doing with their music .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i have the original 7-inch single , and i think it is great . it is kind of a dark , psychedelic record and very heavy on the vocal , but it is a lot better than the version that wa released on the cd .
0	this album ha some great song .
0	i have never been a fan of the blue , but john interpretation of these bluesy riff is exceptional , and the bluesy riff are really well done , especially in the bonus feature . it is a great album from start to finish .
0	this is the best album i have ever heard . i just wish it would play for a longer period of time .
0	i like dave clark five . i like their music .
1	this song make me happy !
0	this is not a bad song , but i would rather call it not-so-good . it is catchy , but not very memorable . the instrumentation is pretty good , but the vocal are weak and the lyric do not do much for me to remember . i like the song , but i do not think i should buy it .
0	this show wa one of my favorite musical of all time . i love it . the actor are wonderful . this is the most talented cast ever assembled for a broadway show . the singing , dancing , and acting make this a great show . this show is a must see for all broadway lover . the show is a must see .

1	i have downloaded and used this app a couple of time and it is awesome .
0	this is a great prince release ! it ha some great tune and the production is very good . the album is not a good a prince other release , but it is still a great prince album .
0	i agree with the sentiment . this is not the best or most beautiful of karajan composition from this era , but it is a fine one to hear . i also found karajans use of the traditional trumpet to be excellent here . it is one of the few recording of this sort in which the trumpet is not drowned out by the other instrument . the flute and violin have a certain sense of intimacy that is part of karajans genius a a composer . when the orchestra play the piano , they seem to be playing on the same level a the violin and cello . that is karajan .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

0	i have played this album from start to finish and it is one of my favorite prince album . i love the song and i love how prince ha progressed his sound in the last few year .
0	i like the song but i think it is a little repetitive . it is a good song , but i do not think they are good enough to be in the top 100 .
1	this song and the album are awesome !
1	every song is a winner ! this album is a winner !
1	this is not a good song at all . it is not a good song at all . it is not a good song . i do not like it . it is not a good song . i do not like the song at all . the vocal are not bad , but they just do not sound good . i have had this cd for a while now . i am glad i bought it . it is a good song . the vocal are good . the song is good . the song is good . the song is a good one . it is a good one . it is really good . it is really good . it is good . it is really good . i like it . it is a good song . i like it . i like it . it is a good song . it is a good song . it is good . it is a good song . it is really good . it is really good . i like it . i like it . it is good . it is a good song . i really like it . i really like it . i like it . it is good . i really like it . i like it . it is a good song . it is a good song . i like it . it is good . it is good . it is good . it is a good song . the vocal are good .
1	i really like this song , and i love the guitar part , but i do not like the chorus . i like the chorus myself , but it is the only one i do not like .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	tom scott ’ s first solo album , entitled “ state of trance 2008 ” is a wonderful album . it ’ s fun , upbeat , and ha a lot of great song . this album will not take you more than a few minute , and it won ’ t get boring . it ’ s a great album for any tom scott fan .
1	this is the best cd i have ever bought . this is the only cd i would ever buy . i bought it for myself and my two friend . i have loved dave and the other guy since i wa a kid . i have been buying these album for a long time . i love them , and i have been trying to buy them for a long time and i have not been able to find them anywhere . i can not believe it is out of print . if you have never heard of these guy , you have to get this album . it is one of the best cd i have ever bought . i do not know why the cd did not get sold . it is too good .
0	this cd is very nice . i bought this album so that i could listen to it on my iphone during the noon nap . it is very relaxing . i would recommend it .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	this is the first karajan recording , however
0	i can not believe you people would put this album up for sale . what do you expect the majority of people to do with it . it is sad when people take it out of context .

1	this album is good , but it is not a good a the first . the song are good , but the band is not a good a the first . it is not a bad album , but i feel that the band ha improved since then .
0	i would recommend this album to anyone who love art and music and is in the mood for a good listen . if you like it , buy it . if you don ; t , do not .
0	not a full length , but worth a listen . the version here is from a cassette recording that i purchased in the 1990s from a local record store . the sound quality is poor , and i have a bad habit of listening to thing in the car . but it is quite enjoyable . for the most part , it is very similar to the live version of the song i heard with tom wait in 1998 .
1	this compilation ha a real nice feel to it . i really liked this compilation of the music from the late 1950s . the song are all great . all the artist on this compilation are very well known and they all did amazing thing . the music is very well produced and the arrangement are very well done . i really liked this compilation .
1	i think the guitar solo is really the best part in
0	this album wa just a commercial for the record industry . the song are a far cry from jewel best work . the sound is so lifeless and the song selection seem half-assed . one of the few redeeming feature is that i am a man ( the title track ) is a real gem . it is the best song on the album , and it should be promoted more than the title track .
0	i have been very excited for this album to come out because i have heard that the band member are back in the studio recording and i have been waiting for it to come out . i have already purchased a copy of it to see what they have to say . let u see what they have to say .

0	this is not a christian album - at all . this album is a very commercial , corporate , christian artist . the song are not of biblical value . i would not buy this album either . i am disappointed . this album is a waste of your money .
1	i would describe this album a a mix of r & b , hip hop , rock , and pop . it a good mix of all of the genre and i think it will be a hit . and i love listening to a good mix of all of the genre . this album is a good mix of all the genre .
0	if you like the dave clark five , you are going to love this . it is a collection of their song , with a few added instrumentals by paul humphreys . the song are a good a anything out of the eighty . it is just a if they are playing in the early eighty . the only thing i will say is that it is not a good a the original lineup album , but that is what i wanted after listening to this album .
0	i think the song is a hit . i love the song . i think the song is a hit . i think the song is a hit .
1	i think it is a great song . i do not really know if it is a hit or not , but i really like it . i only wish i had a better choice . i do not know if it is a hit or not . it is just a good song . i do not know if it is a hit or not .

0	i am a huge fan of his vocal style . i have been a fan of his for a long time . that is why i wa very surprised to find him on this new record . i am so glad he did this record . i love that he ha put out other recording of his vocal , but i am so glad he is back to doing it . i really enjoy these recording , and i am a fan . i am glad he is back to doing his vocal and i hope to be able to see him perform more soon . i am looking forward to hearing more of his work .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this album wa an okay one .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .

1	this is a great song ! it reminds me of a friend of mine who is a true believer of god and is always looking for a song that brings him closer to god . this is a song to listen to when you want to find a song and get closer to god .
0	i could listen to this for hour . the only song i could change are the song about the different state of mind . i could have done without the one about changing state of mind , though . i liked the song , though . i do not know why i left it out , but i guess i did not like it .
0	i have to be honest here . i do not think i can recommend this song . i mean , i am not singing , so i do not think it is that bad , but it is just something i do not get . i would definitely recommend it , but i can not .
1	this is the best country song ever . i love it .
0	the album ha a lot of good stuff in it , but it is a really weak album . the first track is really good , but it is the rest of them that fall apart . i have listened to them a few time and i do not recommend them to everyone . the rest of the music is average . however , all of the song are very enjoyable . the song i can not stop is a great song . it is one i love to dance to . i believe the music video is in the work . it is called take me away and should be quite good . it should be released soon . the next cd i am buying is called home and it is a really good album . i love the name . it sound like home to me . it is a good album , but it is a little disappointing to me . i think it is very good and ha a lot of good stuff in it . it just ha a weak first track and it is the rest of the song that are weak . the song on this cd are the same a the other cd i am buying . it is a good album and it is a great song . it is take me away that is really great . it is a great song that i will always remember . i recommend this cd to everyone .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	it is a rock and roll song , but it is one of the best rock song from the 70 with a great beat . this song reminds me of the beat of your heart by the beach boy . the beat of this song is great and it is a great song to rock out to .
1	this cd is excellent . the song are very good .
1	this is the best cd in the movie .

0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this album is not meant to be listened to on any device other than a cd player . not even a ipod .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this song ha a nice beat and she ha a good voice . she is a great singer .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country music karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s and.mpgs from amazon - the process is easy .

0	this song ha an amazing little part at the beginning , where she sings a little line . i love that part . but the rest of the song is horrible . i will not buy the cd , and i really do not understand why .
1	this album is a great rock album . it is the best rock album in about a decade .
0	this is an okay recording . there are some pretty decent guitar solo and the bassist is well-known on the southern california scene . there is not enough vocal to make it great .
1	this album is very good . i love how the song are mixed together rather than being isolated from each other . it seems to make the song a little more cohesive . this album is a very good start to your christmas day .
0	i can not believe how much i love this song . it will always be part of my repertoire .
1	i am a huge fan of miley . this is one of her best album .
0	i like the theme for this show . i love the theme song .

0	nice song , but i did not really like it .
0	i did not like the song at all and i thought it wa very boring . the chorus wa very good , but after that the song just fell flat . i thought that it would be better if the chorus wa not there at all . i thought the first part of the song wa ok and then after that it just felt like i just did not understand what wa going on and i just thought it wa too long .
0	i like it . i like it very much .
1	dave clark five do not disappoint .
1	this song really got me . i wa listening to this song and trying to find an old version . it just came on in the middle of my drive home , and i instantly thought this song wa a song by one of my favorite . i have only listened to this song once , and i can say that it wa the best i have ever listened to .

0	i love mariah and want so much but can not seem to find her . this is an excellent album . i love the old school feel and the song are very nice . i wish this album wa on cd , if only to have it on repeat at home .
1	this cd is a wonderful collection of classical music from the great composer of the 20th century . the sound quality on the cd is excellent , the song are well performed and the performer is very good at his craft . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like classical music . the only complaint i have is that the back cover ( on the cd that came with the box ) say that the cd is a companion volume to the bolero cd . however , the cd is a stand alone .
0	this is an awesome album ! this is a must have for every fan of oldie . the album start with the a christmas fanfare which is followed by i ’ ll be home for christmas which is followed by god rest ye merry gentleman . the album then go into another medley of here come santa and jingle bell . the album end with aul ’ lang syne .
0	i wish i had listened to this album when i wa 13. i am 22 now , and i can not believe that it took me this long to discover this album . i am now listening to it in my car , and it is great .
0	this band is amazing ! i love everything about this band !
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	the beatles are one of the best band ever . this album is great .

1	not only doe he write great music , but he also play great a a soloist . tom scott ha a lot of great music to add to the jazz repertoire .
1	i really like her voice and music and hope to be able to hear her again .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	this is a very good song . i have played it quite a few time and the crowd always love it .
1	great album . this album is great , it is a great cover and the band is excellent . great production , and sound great . i really enjoy this album .
0	i think this album is great . i listen to it on a regular basis . the only thing that keep me from giving it a 10 is the song that start with the letter n are just boring and repetitive and not worth it . but then again , if you are a fan of miley they do not get much better than these .
0	another great album .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i absolutely love this band . i first heard this band in the early 90 and have been hooked ever since . this album is what put this band on the map . this is their most underrated album . this is the band that influenced the entire pop music scene . one of the greatest song they ever wrote and still a favorite of mine after all these year .
0	i saw this show last night . the only thing i can say is that it wa very disappointing . it seemed like the actor were very nervous about the stage show . i have seen the broadway show twice and wa disappointed that it wa not more powerful .
0	i love tom wait , and do not mind much about this album because i like the song . the album is better than his previous one . i thought it wa a good album and i will buy it .
0	i don ; t like the way she sings , but i would really like to hear more of her music .
1	i think this song work really well a a background for any sort of video . it is a really good song , but i think the music is a little too slow to be able to be used a a background for anything . it is a cool song , but not really something i would want to use a a background for my video .
1	i started taking piano lesson when i wa in the 7th grade . i wa a good student , so i practiced for a lot of hour . my parent were not very supportive , but they did put a lot of effort into my lesson and i owe them a lot .
1	i love the cd . i have bought a lot of them . the song are good . the chord are very good .
1	i love this song , i wa surprised how many people seemed to be fan of this song and the voice , so i guess it is pretty popular , but my favorite is the song the day i met you , they are really amazing song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	great collection of song , some of great quality .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .

0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	it is an mp3 download . the product is exactly what wa advertised .
1	i have been listening to this for a few week now . i am a big fan of this song . it is a very personal song , but the writing is beautiful . the only thing that i do not like is that david lee roth sings with a slight lisp , but it is not a big deal . i am sure that he can sing with his lisp , but i have never had a problem with that . i give this album 3 star .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	love this song . it is a favorite of my husband . it is a great song to sing when you need a good song to get your mind off of your problem , to get you back on track .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i wa going to give this a positive rating , but then i listened to it this morning and really did not like it . it is just too upbeat .
0	a little over played and over produced .
0	i thought this wa a great song , but i am not the only one who think so . the song name is so misleading , but it is well-sung , and it is a beautiful song .
0	i downloaded this to practice for a country music competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple .
1	this is an album that show that sam sparro is a great jazz musician . he combine old and new jazz style and then make them sound great . this is really a unique sound and add a lot of interest to the traditional jazz music . this is a very well produced album that is also very enjoyable to listen to . i highly recommend this album .
0	i listen to this a lot . i think gene voice shine here .
0	in my opinion , there are only 2 artist that have ever accomplished what lecrae ha accomplished on this album .
1	this is an amazing album , it just rock .
1	i have to admit i really love the album . it is not often you find a band like this . there is a great variety of song and great musicianship . i hope the album make it on to the itunes store . it is really well done music . the song are jam packed with good emotion and the musicianship is excellent . i am sure it will sell well . the band may be gone , but the music is still with u . i am sure this album will go down in history a one of the best album of all time .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i like dave clark five .
0	this song is a classic . the vocal are great and the drum are great . the guitar work is great . it is really fun to listen to .

1	it is a good album .
0	this song give me a lot of hope .
1	i really enjoyed seeing this show . i have seen it twice , and i really enjoyed every second . the cast is excellent . they have put together one of the best cast ever assembled for a broadway show . the singing , dancing , and acting are fantastic . i can not wait to see it again .
0	i have never heard a song like this . i have only heard one song that is similar , and it is not even close to this song . i am currently listening to this album . i have to say it is a good album .
1	i have heard good thing about this album but this is the only one i have heard . what i love most about this album is the diversity of the voice . i do not remember hearing this variety of voice before .
1	i have been a faithful fan of barbra streisand since the 80 . her music and her voice are simply amazing . she wa one of my favorite singer .
0	i am a fan of the dave clark 5 and do not mind their music . i have listened to the song on this cd and they are excellent . i love the song on this album and wish i knew the lyric before i bought the cd . robert

1	i am glad i bought this cd . i like the music
0	i have listened to this album from start to end and now i have finished listening to it . the album ha a lot of good song that are played in a very long time . this album doe not have any bad song . the only bad thing about this album is the quality of the song . the song are very good and they have a lot of good melody , but the song melody are very repetitive . if you want to listen to this album , buy it . if you are really looking for a trance album , this album is not for you .
1	i have to say that this song is incredible ! i am a fan of miley cyrus . i am not a fan of mileys music , but this song is sooo good , and i want to hear more .
0	i agree with the previous reviewer . this is one of the few album i have listened to more than once . i also agree that the band ha lost their way . i think it is hard to find the good stuff in there . the song are good , but it is hard to find the good song . i like the album , but i do not think that it is one of the greatest album of the eighty .
0	this is a great cd . marie osmond sings both the song and the voice for them . they are both very good and mary voice is beautiful .
0	i think this song is great ! i love the song , and it is a great introduction to a great album . i hope it will stay in the top 50 .
1	it is so beautiful . i wish they did more of these type of song . it is a great song , and i hope this is going to be a great album .

0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	there wa an article in the local newspaper a few week ago about the band the red hot chili pepper . this is the first cd i have ever heard of them . i am amazed at how well the band play . they have a good sound and the instrumentals are very well written . i really like the playing . the guitar solo on coffee are very well written and they are fun to listen to . the entire album is very enjoyable .
1	this song ha been known a the funky christmas song for quite a while . it is a funny song .
1	this album is the best rock album of all time .
0	nice album - very much a throwback to the past . hasselvander is obviously a fan of this stuff , and it doe not deserve to be considered a great album . if you are looking for a great album that is well made and enjoyable then you might want to look elsewhere .
1	i love it ! it is really something else . i hope it is a popular album .
0	this song rock . i like the video , too .
0	this album ha a lot of good trance song , but they do not sound very good .
0	i downloaded a copy of this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading mp3s from amazon - the process is easy . i like listening to it . i am not a fan of this song . it is a repetitive song with little charm . it is just a boring piece of garbage .
1	to my ear , this is an awesome sounding recording . it is a little bit like listening to two different band in the same room . i love the mix that they have of the orchestral music that make this track such a pleasure to listen to .
0	this is not my favorite album . it is been year since i have listened to it . but , i love it . i would listen to it all the time and recommend it to anyone who would listen to it .
1	this song is a lot better than i thought . after listening to the first two song i thought i would not be able to like this cd because the first two song are very annoying . i had to listen to the song several time before i could get over the fact the first song made me want to get up and walk out of the room while i sat there listening to the second song . this song is great ! i did not expect to like this song a much a i did . it is a great song and i would recommend it to anyone who like a good song .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i would just like to say that i love this song , and i love the cover and the original , both of which have their own unique quality , but i do not love the way this cover cover the original .
0	the album is very good but the ending wa so messed up .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i like this album . i would listen to it every day . it is worth buying .
0	i wish this song wa better , but it just doe not do it for me .
1	i do not know how to start this review , but i am not happy about the situation i am in .
1	it is catchy and fun to dance to . it is a good song that i am sure i will listen too on the album .
1	i have been working on this app and thought it wa a good buy .
0	this album is terrible , i used to be very fond of this singer but not any more
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i am sorry , but this album is just plain boring . it just doe not sound good at all . the only redeeming quality of this album is the track prelude , which is a great song .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	i bought this cd for my sister-in-law who is a big beatles fan . she loved the song .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to see if my car radio would pick it up . and i know that there are a lot of country song on the radio , so i thought i would give this a try . i liked the song , but i hated the song . i do not think that i will buy this cd again .
0	just listen to this album . it is absolutely amazing . very very good . i got this album a a gift and i am so glad i bought it . i can not give any star because the album is a great one and i do not know if it will ever get a lot of attention from anyone , but i am so glad that it got any attention at all .
1	this is an original recording by the former king of rock n roll , chuck berry . this is a song i have always loved a a kid , and it is a song that i will be singing a lot over the next few month .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	the album is about what happens in the life of a teenage girl , she tell you everything you need to know to get it . that is not all that it is , though . it is not just about a teenage girl , it is about life at all level . it is about the choice you make . it is about how you choose to live your life . it is about the decision you make . it is something i would like to share with you . that is all that i can say . enjoy .
1	i bought this album on a whim because of the cover . i thought it wa by a band i had never heard . it is a very good live album . good song list though .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i love this song , and i think it is a really good song . this song is great . i like it . i have it in the car with me on drive time . the only reason i do not rate this song is because i like sam sparros black and gold album , and this is not that album . i would rate it a 4.5/5 .
1	i think she doe a really great job with her vocal . it is hard to tell whether or not she is singing in the key of c or f. she sound like she is singing in the key of am , which i think is a good thing .
1	i think this is a great cd . this is the only cd i have ever bought from cdnow and i am completely satisfied with it . - i really like the song on this cd . the song were pretty good . i thought the song were pretty good . - i like the song on this cd . the song were pretty good . - the song were pretty decent . - i liked the song on this cd .
1	this is a good song .
1	this is a wonderful album . not my favorite , but the best of the one i have purchased . it is a great collection of song . the vocal are wonderful . i love the song . i would recommend this album to anyone .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	it is not easy to sum up the dave clark five in a sentence . however , i will try to put it in this way . they are the greatest pop band in the history of pop music . they deserve every penny they have ever made .
1	this is by far one of the best on the radio .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	i like this band . i buy their cd from time to time . not because i know them or anything , but because i like them . i do not have a lot of cd by the dave clark five . i buy their cd from time to time because i like them . they are a great band , and i buy their cd from time to time because i like them . i do not know why they need to make their video look a if they are trying to be cool like some other band . i do not know why they need to have their music on youtube . i like them , and i like their music , and i do not know why they need to make their video look like they are trying to be cool . there are a lot of other band out there that are trying to be cool , so why not just do what they are doing ? i do not know . i do not like them . i like them , but i do not like their video . i do not know why they need to be so goofy . it is fine to make your video look like they are trying to be cool . it is okay to make your music look like it is trying to be cool . it is okay to make your song look like they are trying to be cool . it is okay to make your video look like they are trying to be cool . it is okay to be funny . it is okay to be funny . it is okay to make your video funny . it is okay to be goofy . it is okay to be goofy . it is okay to make your video look like they are trying . it is okay to make your video look like they are trying , it is okay . it is okay to be goofy . it is okay to look goofy . it is okay to look goofy . do not do it ! do not do it ! i do not like that . i do not like that . i do not like that .
1	i love the i need a man song . i think the band did a great job with this . i really like the member of this band a well , and i really like the band .
0	the band first album , and one of the few that i have owned . i find the band growing up , though , that i am not impressed at all . it is not a bad album , but it is not good either . it is got a few song that will make your ear perk up , but other song are not good at all . there are a few song that i really like , but i do not think they are great song . i wa more into the band before , but now i do not really care for these song . they just seem to be filler , and i think that people who like the band could have done with a few better song . it is not a bad album , but i think that if it wa released in the eighty , it would have been much better .
0	i thought the song wa good , but the vocalist voice is annoying . i hope she can sing better in the future .
0	i have to admit i wa a big fan of the dave clark five . although i would not necessarily say my opinion of them wa completely positive , i can remember a time when i wa listening to their music at home and i wa really enjoying it . their song still hold up even though i have heard them so many time . i can not imagine my life without them . the cd i have purchased from them have always been well done . i have no complaint about this one .

0	this album is good , but it is not my cup of tea .
0	i have been a fan of jewel since her first cd dreaming . i have been disappointed by her music since then . this is a very disappointing album . it is like the cd that got you in trouble , and you had to listen to it for the rest of your life . i do not know how she can put out a cd like this . i hope i never meet her . she is a very rude and obnoxious person .

1	i am a big fan of prince , and i am so happy that i finally have at least one record of his that i can put my hand on . in his early day , prince wa amazing and ha a beautiful voice . the music on this album is fantastic . i have to say i love his raspberry beret and super freak ( and purple rain for that matter ) and his love symbol is the best song on the album , that ha a great beat and amazing vocal . to me , this album is all about his early day , and i am glad i got it .
0	i downloaded the.mp3s to practice karaoke for my country competition . the song is great , but i am not a country fan , it is better than those that are on the movie . i recommend it to those who like country .

1	this is my current favorite album of hers . i have a few album of hers that i love , but this is the album that i can always listen to and be happy with . it is a hard album to find and i am sure that you will have to ask around for a copy . if you like this album , you will love this artist . i can not say that i agree with everything that she say , but her album are always full of good song .

0	i do not care what anyone say , this album is not worth the $ 14.99 . bonnie is one the best singer but this album is a waste of time . even the song she sings are terrible . i do not understand how anyone would listen to this album . bonnie and the pretender are much better .

0	the lyric to this song are not very clear . i am not sure if i should take this cd or not .
0	i am in no way trying to bash this album , or the guy for that matter , but i just can not sit through this album . i wa really into the first album , but this one just go on and on . i guess it is because i am not a huge fan of this style of music , although i do respect those band .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this is a great album ! i do not usually listen to new release a they are usually just too weird and i do not like them . i am a fan of trance , but i do not listen to anything too new and i have to say that this album is one of the best trance album that

0	i have not listened to the cd but i would not recommend the cd because it is missing the song the way i am that is on the cd .
1	i think this is one of the most beautifully written song i have ever heard .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .

1	this album is great . i thought it wa better than the last album , but that last one is still great . i do like the guitar solo in the last one , though . i like the album cover , but i wish they would have included their bass solo . i do not enjoy the band sound live . it is one of the worst live band of all time . i do not like the bass solo in the album . the band is very good live , they can really play .

1	i love tandy tucker . i will definately buy this album when
0	i have purchased several different tom wait cd . i have never come across a tom wait cd that i did not enjoy . he ha always been able to make a cd that i am happy to listen to . i also like tom wait because he ha a voice that ha an ability to carry a tune . he always sound like he is singing . he is one of those artist that when i hear his music i just want to dance . his music is very mellow sounding . his music can be played at any time of the day .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

1	this is a great song . the song ha a great sound and it is a very nice song to play . i would recommend this to anyone .
1	this album ha good music , but i do not think it really take the listener on a journey , it is more of a compilation of song from the 80 . it is more of a throwaway release , but i still think it ha good quality song .
0	this song made me want to use this website le .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	it is a very good song and i like the movie version better .
0	this is a pretty good album . it ha a nice variety of song . however , i think that the quality of the song might be a little better if they were recorded in a le commercial way .
0	i like the grateful dead , but i think that the price of the cd are a bit exhorbitant . i have been listening to them for year and they are the best in quality , but the price is $ 20 for a cd , when you get a cd for $ 10 .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	what is the deal with this guy ? i have listened to this cd a few time , and i am getting sick of it . the song are good , but not great . i do not understand why he doe what he doe . the song are great , but it is the production that make me sick .
0	this song wa great
0	in all of his work , this is maybe the weakest . this is the first i have heard where he doe not really give it his all . the instrumentation is good but the song is too long at over six minute . the recording of this piece is top notch . i would rank it a 6/10 . it ha a good amount of variation , and there are some good solo and counter melody . there are a few nice moment , such a the one at 2:45 , but overall it not that spectacular . i would recommend this to fan of rachmaninoff and some other classical work . it is good . but not necessarily great . it is a good listen all the way through .

1	the best song of this album . it is a very good song . i really enjoy the lyric . it ha a nice guitar sound and it go into the word very well . i like the voice from barbra streisand and the singer from the chordettes . the song is very well sung . i am surprised the song ha come all the way to the top of the list , because i do not think it is a very good song . i am surprised the album will not go all the way to the top of the list .
1	this wa the best song the miley cyrus album ha got . it ha a little bit of everything in it . it is really like a cross between a lot of pop and a lot of rock . rockn roll ! the video is an awesome part of the song . although , the song is good . i like it just the way it is . rockn roll ! the lyric are very nice . the song sound a little like britney spear oops ! i did it again ( what go around go around ) i do not know why i like it so much . the only thing i like about it is the music video . the song is great . it ha a very catchy beat , but it is kind of boring when miley doe it . the song lyric are decent and the song is very good . this song is great . rockn roll !

1	i am glad i wa able to get an advance copy because i can not imagine this album being put out in another format . it is an overall good trip though . if i could take anything out of this album , it would be that it is a very different sounding album than many of the other album by the dave clark five , many of which i have heard and have always liked .

1	i love the variety of artist on this one cd . i am not a fan
1	this
1	i just finished listening to this , and i think it is a keeper . i do not know why i had not given this album a more listen yet . if you are a fan of this style of music , you will not be disappointed . i am not a fan of pop/rock , so i enjoyed this album quite a bit more than i should have .
1	this is a great album . if you like listening to song by song , this is a good album . if you like listening to song or listening to a whole album , this is a great album .
0	i wa wondering how i managed to get onto this . i wa not surprised , and i am happy with it . this is a big seller , and i expect it to keep in it top 10 seller for some time to come . i have been a fan and a fan of jan garbarek since the early 80 , when he wa with roxy music . i had hoped that when it came to me , he would come through , but i have to admit that he ha been with me all along . i hope that he continues . i have always said that his music is the most beautiful one which i have ever heard , and i am not ashamed to say that i love it and i hope that he continues to be in the band .

0	it would be nice to have a cd of all of john coltranes great album . i know that there are several great album by coltranes jazz contemporary , but it would be nice to have the complete set . i liked the cd , but i thought all of the track were very boring . the album wa great , so i guess the cd is ok , but i would have preferred to have this album or some other great jazz cd that coltrane did . i think i am going to have to listen to this cd again .

0	this is a great album . the best . i have heard so far .
1	it is a nice tune , very short , but the sound is good and the bass is pretty good . there are some problem of course , but i will work on them . i like the simplicity of it . it is also a little on the loud side .
1	i don ; t think i have heard this album since the 90 . this is the best version of the song and i think it show how much jerry vocal have improved .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i love love this song . it is one of the best song ever made . it reminds me of being young , and just want to be happy .
0	cd is good , but i thought the cover work wa a little odd . can not use it a a coaster . the music is decent . i will be using it a a coaster .

0	i like this song very much . i wish you had more song like this .
1	i really enjoyed the last album by this band . the opening track wa the house that jack built and the guitar solo and riff in some good year made me want to start playing guitar again . the lyric were very catchy and the band sounded very tight . i have enjoyed all their album so far but this one stood out . the band is a great live band and i think it is best to keep that in mind when listening to their recording . this is an excellent album .

0	well , the album itself is decent , but the song are not . there are some beautiful song on this album , but the rest are just a bunch of commercial christian song , which is a waste of your money . this album is an easy listen , but it is not good . i would definitely not buy this album if you listen to it .
0	i love this album . i love the sound of the original album . the movie version is the same though .
0	i have tried listening to the new jvj album twice and i am still not over it . i am not sure i understand what jvj want to do with their music anymore . it is like they have lost sight of what made their first album so good . i am not sure i understand what the new album will be either . i just do not get it . it is like the singer ha lost the ability to sing , or the band ha lost the ability to play . i do not think they should be trying to be something they are not anymore . i can not get over the fact that the new album is going to be just a good a the last one . i am not sure i want to go back to the old jvj . i am not sure i want to go back to the old jvj . i guess i am just going to have to go with my gut .
0	not my favorite , but i love the song .
0	i think i like this band more than most
0	when i wa a child i listened to this song all the time . it wa my first song that i enjoyed . it is a fun song to listen to . i loved it .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i can not remember a time when i did not like this song . i believe i first learned this song in the seventh grade .
0	i bought this album in order to get the album in the mail to my brother . i am sure not many people would buy an album to get a cd in the mail .
0	great album . a very interesting album .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i have just pre-ordered this album . i really do not know what to expect . miley cyrus is an incredible performer and i am looking forward to it . i will support her with my money . i can not wait to hear her new album . i have tried to buy two copy of her cd , but it is already on sale . i can not wait . i am looking forward to it .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	barbra would have killed herself if this album had been released . she wa a great singer before she got sick . now she can do no better than singing about how happy she is to be alive and all .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i love this song and video , but i do not like the video .
0	a good song , but the video is a mess .
1	it is a nice song , it is good , but , it is not the best song i have ever heard .
1	this is an excellent album .
0	i did not like this cd . very plain . i will probably buy the cd , but not the song . i will however buy the song because the song ha a good beat and tempo . i did not like the lyric on this song . very boring .
1	this song is a very good song .
1	you have to have a pretty low tolerance to listen to tom wait . he ha good song , but not too many good song . he ha a lot of great album , but this is the first one that is really great . it is really good .
1	this song really rock me .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i wa so disappointed with this album . every song is a waste of time . a lot of the song sound the same a the rest of the album . i do not give a rat head about any of this so called art so i am just going to move on .

0	i have listened to this song several time , many more time than i can count . it still get me every time .
1	i loved this album and i have never listened to anything like it .
0	it is not a bad song , it is just not a very interesting song .
0	i really liked this song . i liked the music in general . the lyric are also good . the only problem with this song is that the music is just not good .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	the performance here in this collection are all exceptional , but the recording quality is not up to par with some of the others . they are all very enjoyable , though , and i think that this collection is a good way to get to know beethoven music . this is the first time i have ever heard the piece performed in this way , and it is a real treat . the recording are full of wonderful sound , and the quality of the recording is excellent . it is a pleasure to listen to these recording , and they are definitely worth the price they cost .
0	miley is such a talented woman . i love when she say i am so glad all my dream came true . i hope she is not a drug addict .
0	i bought it because it is my new fav band and it is so good .
1	this album rock
1	this song is great !
0	a song that will make you cry . it is hard to explain . it like having a friend die . i am not sure it is possible to cry about someone who is not there .
0	it is the same version a the original , with the band playing along with the vocal . it ha some good version of song by the grateful dead , but this is not one of them . it is a great version , but it is not the same .
0	this is the best song in the entire collection . i had to rip it off a cd i purchased at a garage sale to listen to it . the sound quality is excellent , the lyric are well written and well sung , and this song is so catchy . love this song .
1	to hear this song in concert is an absolute dream . it sound like the dave clark five and i am glad they are doing it . i like listening to their music a lot . robert
0	this song is a great song . i love it .
1	this is an amazing album . there is a lot of music in this album . i give this album 5 star . i do not think it is the best album of the decade but it is one of the best . i love the music .
1	very entertaining ! the lead vocalist is very good , and the band member play a great mix of different genre . there are a couple of song that i really did not care for , but overall , i am actually really glad i bought this album .
1	great album , and great music !
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i have been to a couple of concert where this song wa performed and it wa beautiful . it is a beautiful song . i have got a little girl and she love it .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this song is good , but the video is not very good .
1	i like the positive message in this song . i think the lyric are very catchy and the music is great . i like the way she sings the song .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i have been a sam sparro fan since american idol . i wa surprised by the quality of the cd , but i wa impressed . i liked the song love you so and the other song on the cd .
1	i have been a fan of the dave clark five since the 80 . i am a fan of the music .
0	what a horrible song . i like the hook but this song is so bad that it take away all the good that the rest of the song add . it is so bad that i feel bad for the singer .
0	awol nation is a really fun song with a lot going . it is super short . the chorus is kind of annoying .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	very good song but boring video .
1	i am a fan of her music . i wa looking forward to it a whole lot . i love the way it sound and how she incorporates her own lyric in her music . i can not wait for it to be released .
1	i wa hoping this cd would not be disappointing . i liked the first album . but when i listened to the second , i liked the song more on this album . i think it is because the song on the first album were not so good and the song on the second album were better . i think that song on this cd are better than the song on the first album . i think that the song on this album are better than the song i heard on the first album .
0	so what do you think ? the album is nice , the song are good , but the album is really not worth the $ 200 .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i just bought this album recently . i have played it a few time on my stereo . it sound very good . i have also been listening to some of the track from it . this is the first time i have heard the song the one . it is great . i have listened to it so many time . i am very happy with this purchase . i love the style of this song . it is very upbeat and very memorable . i have never heard a mix of this song like this before . i am very impressed .
0	there is a lot of great song on this album , but i am not sure i am a fan of the one on the album for some reason .
0	i think this is a good song !
1	i loved this song when i wa a teen , but i do not like the version that we are all hearing on the radio . i can not understand why the radio station did not play the actual recording when they were recording the song . this is a very good song , and i really like the version of this song that is on the radio .
1	lorde ha a great voice . i love lordes song . this song is something that i can not put into word .
1	this is cool , but the video is a bit boring .
1	this song is a classic . i love it .
1	this song is a good song .
0	i liked some of her song . i have heard a lot of her song . she is the best .
0	the cd is one of the best blue album i have ever heard ! the music is great - not many people have the quality of the music on this album . the lyric are not bad , but it is the quality of the lyric that i think is the best . it is definitely a quality album . i will give it three star , but it is not an best album of the year award .
0	this is a good song . i like a lot of the stuff he ha done . i do not care for his writing style . i think he is a better singer than writer . i think he is a very nice guy . i feel there would be no harm in buying this cd , but i would not recommend it .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	miley is really talent , but shes not my favorite singer .
0	this is great . i love it .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i love the oldie in nashville . it make me feel at home . but this version of here come the sun is not oldie . it is old , but not oldie . i hear it today and it make me think of the nashville song . it is so good .
1	i have been a fan of these album ever since i discovered them in the 80 . i am the music director for a jazz radio station and the music i play is mainly jazz , but i also play a lot of classical music .
1	i first came accross this band on my radio , and i love their music .
0	this song ha some very nice guitar part . it is hard to find an artist that can write a song that sound real good on the guitar . i like the way they do it . i like the way they do it ; it is real country .
1	this album is like a complete 180 from it predecessor that were released in 2008. it ha a much more mature sound . it ha a much more mature style of production . it is an album that ha a lot of energy , and is full of fun . the song that i am most impressed with is praise is what i do which is a very upbeat and fun song that is sure to keep you dancing . the song , awesome is very high energy and ha a great beat . i also liked the song good , praise is what i do , and one pure and holy passion . i do not know if anyone else will agree with me , but i really like the song thank you and thank you on this album . it is all good .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	i am not sure if this is about a relationship between a man and his wife or a woman being in relationship with a man who is cheating on her . if it is the former , then this song is about how he is getting the best of her . it is a song about a woman cheating on her man . and it is about how she is taking his love for granted . ugh . i think those are the two thing that make this song feel like it is about a woman . ( i am not very good at this , so i do not know . i am not really sure what the song is about . ) but it is a good song . i like the song . it make me feel bad for her .
0	i really liked the song when i heard it on the radio ( i know , i know ) and the video is cool too .
1	this is an incredible collection of music that is very well done .
1	i purchased this album a a gift for my husband . i am a worship leader , so i like to encourage my worship team and they all like this album . i especially like the song that are encouraging and uplifting . i would recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a worship album that is uplifting and encouraging .
0	i have heard of this album and i liked it .
0	i have no idea what this song is about .
0	this album is very good . it is better then the last album .
0	i think it is a good song , but it is not a great song . i mean , i think david lee roth wa a very talented singer and a very good performer . but his vocal are very much of the pop variety and they do not really fit his style . and , to be fair , he is not exactly a bad singer either . but his voice simply make his music sound bad . i have listened to several of his album and he still sound like he is singing for a high school choir . so his voice just doe not fit the song he sang on . but it is a pretty good song , so i still give this a 3 star rating .
1	i really like this song . it is great because it is from the show .
0	this is one of the better song i have ever heard . the lyric are very good . the guitar playing is also good , but the lyric are not . i can not understand the lyric , but i can understand the guitar playing .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	there is an old woman singing this song on the radio- i think it is from the early 1950s . i like the tune .
0	this album is a good album , but i had to force myself to listen to it . i wa not too pleased with it . the album i already have is at least better .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	this song rock . this song is a great song , and i am sure a lot of people have heard it before , but hearing it for the first time in over 10 year is something i never thought would happen .
0	i have not listened to the cd . i would not recommend this either .
0	there is a song by barbra streisand called the way we were , but it is not on this cd .
0	cd wa excellent , and i have been buying cd from amazon for the last dozen year . the cover art is beautiful , but the music will be lost to time . i am disappointed with music from amazon , but i will continue to buy cd from them because of their excellent selection .
1	this song is amazing , i can not find any negative review on it .
1	i like this album .
0	she is a very talented singer .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	wow , the quality of this album is very poor . i am glad that this album is out .
0	i just went through a complete box set and this is the only album i did not like . i know it is not a new album , but this is the only album that i did not like . i do not know why it wa released and i hope it is a compilation that you can listen to and decide if you like it or not . this album is a great album but just too repetitive and too boring .
1	i have heard this song many time and i love it . when i first heard this song i wa like , wow . this song sound like the goodbye blue sky song . then i wa like , yes . this is the same song . but a time go on , i realized that this is not the same song , but it is the same song that wa released in 1957. so , it wa a great start .
1	this is a great song .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	this is such a great song . i love it and i would like to have a video of it made .
1	love this album !
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this album contains some of the
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this cover of the dave clark five the love of god is not that bad . the guitar work is good , and the drum are okay . the lyric are hard to understand . i am not a fan of their cover of other classic song , and i find this cover to be mediocre .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	a true artist in my opinion . i have listened to this song so many time , and i still get chill and goosebump each time i listen to it . it is an incredible piece of music .
0	i have to be honest . i am not sure what to make of this . i know that she is doing a breakup song and still releasing it , but i really liked the video and i really like the album she is making now . my only dislike is that she is singing about her father in the first song . i know that she is trying to break up with this guy , and i hope she will get back with him .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i love the music of george gershwin . i listened to this entire album twice in one sitting . i wa surprised at how much i enjoyed listening to this collection of gershwin music . i have never heard a recording which ha the complete work of gershwin in one album . i would have to say that i now have the best collection of george gershwin music available on vinyl .
0	i have a bad feeling about this one . it is a bad song .
0	so glad to see that someone finally went through every one of his album . this is a pretty solid record . the highlight are the song from his solo acoustic album , the tune he released with his band , and the studio rendition of the classic . i do not know if it is his best album , but it is certainly one of his better one . that said , the song from his solo album are a little disappointing . his playing is still very good , but the song are somewhat lacking . there are some nice tune on this album , but they just do not stand out a much a other tune .
1	i enjoy listening to this song , and it is a very good song . i like the way the song is structured and the lyric are sang . this song is very different than most of the other song i have heard .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i have been listening to all their album for year and this is the best of the bunch .
0	barbra speaks to the soul .
0	very good
1	i love this cd ! it make me feel good .
0	this is a good album .
1	i have not had a chance to listen to the cd yet so i do not have an opinion . i will listen to it for sure though . i would rate it 2 star if i could , but i have to listen to it first .
0	i really like the lyric here .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this cd is a wonderful listen . i have been listening to it for almost a year .
1	i bought it a few week ago , and i must admit i have never heard of this artist before . this album sound like one i would like to listen to and i feel that i have just discovered this artist . the music is amazing , the album is really well put together and it ha great song .
0	i have been a fan of ohearn since the 80 . i have listened to his album multiple time , some on a mp3 player and some on a cd player . his music ha always been very positive . i love the jesus music genre and wa always drawn to them .
0	this is not really that good . not my favorite song . but , i like the song .
1	these are some of my favorite song of 2017. i highly recommend this album if you are a fan of jeff buckley , john mayer , or even some of his older song like the day the world went away .
1	i loved this song . the lyric were very funny , and the music is great .
0	this is a very good cd . i will give it a 4 star rating . it sound much better than it look . i love the cd . i will be using it .
0	i love the song . this is one of her best song . it is very good .
1	i bought this book for a very specific reason . this is the first time i have felt so strongly about one of my pet peeve that i have had to write a positive review . i am not going to even bother to explain why i am so excited by this book . suffice it to say , this book is great .
1	this is one of the best country song ever .

0	i enjoyed this tape , i wish i could buy it .
1	i thought this song wa good , but i really did not like it . i think it is a really cool song , but i thought it wa a little too soft . i thought it would make a good worship song , but i thought it wa just a little bit too soft and a little bit too soft . i thought it would be nice for church , but i just could not enjoy it a much a i thought it would be .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i downloaded about 40 song to listen to while i wa driving .
0	i like the sound of this music , but it is a bit repetitive and the song are too long and the lyric are too long
0	i bought this cd on a whim , and have already listened to it twice . it is a great cd for what it is . no doubt , there are a lot of great song , but the vocal part are really weak . i am glad i stuck with my cd collection .
0	i really like this album . it is a big album with a lot of song in it . i really like the song on it . i also like the fact that it is an album , and not a single song .
1	i am very happy with this cd . i have bought it twice and the other time when i have come home and could not find it i would hear it and i felt really relaxed . it wa such a pleasant sound to listen to . it is a very good cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone .

1	i like dave clark five and their song .
1	i like the cover . the cover is nice . the cover is very nice . the cd itself is not bad . you do not have to listen to the video to enjoy the cd . the cd ha good music . it is a good cd . i love it .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i have listened to the new jvj album several time . i like the new album better . i have been listening to jvj for about ten day now .
1	this song is one of the most moving , and heartwarming song i have ever heard . it is a great song with great lyric and awesome music .
0	after listening to this cd , i think it is very , very , very bad . i will never buy it . i do not like this music . i do not like tom scott . i do not like the song . i do not know why i like tom scott music . it is very , very , very bad .
1	it doe not seem to be on the app anymore . i wa hoping it would be there .
1	this is the 5th song from the album , and the best one of them all . i love it ! the song is slow and mellow , and it is perfect for the whole family .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	first of all , i love the album , but i can not really find the vocal for some of the song that are listed in the description . could you please edit the description to make all the song mentioned on the description a vocal ? these song are awesome and i can not find them for the first time i have ever heard them .
1	my son gave it to me for my birthday . it say brandy with her own brandy on the front of the cd . he loved it . it is a cute song .
0	i don ; t know why i can not get the cd on my ipod . the only good song on the cd is the light .
0	i have mixed feeling about this album . i love the music , but it is just not my thing . there are a few track that are really good , and a few that could have used more work , but overall it is a good album .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	the first time i heard this song i drove all the way to the nantes festival , france , it wa beautiful . the first time i heard the song at a wedding , i wa at the hotel room and the sound wa so peaceful .
1	i love this album , but in all honesty i think the quality of the album is just below average . the vocal are definitely better than the song , though . the lyric are great though , and definitely a positive review .
0	i wa in a band before i wa in a band . i wa in a band in college . i have been playing since i wa about 17. i have never played a gig in my life , so i am not that good . i have been playing for year . i love the guitar . i love the songwriting . i do not know what i am doing here . this is not a good album . it is not bad . i would almost like to give it a 2 , but i do not know if i can . i hope you all enjoy it .
0	this song is great , and i love the lyric . i think this song is a hit , but this song is not my favorite . i can not stand the music , but the lyric are good though . i like the song , but i am not sure if i like it a much a the other song on this list .
0	i have listened to this band for many year and i love it . i have many album that feature their music . this is not one . i have listened to it twice . it is great . it is good .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	a great song . i heard this on the radio . i am not sure why i like it better than i like most of the tom waits/ella fitzgerald/bob dylan stuff .

0	this song is beautiful and i am going to buy it . i love this song . i really love this song . i love it ! i really love this song . i love this song .
0	i like some of cash more uptempo song , but this is more of a slower , mellower song .
0	i do not like it , it just take too long to get to the end of the song , it go too fast .
1	great harmony super fourties group

1	i am a big fan of beethoven . this is the best recording of his piano concerto no . 5. i would love to play it on any instrument . the recording quality is excellent . the instrumentation is also excellent . this is a great performance of this piece .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .

1	this is one of the most beautiful christmas album i have been exposed to in a long time .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i would highly recommend this book to anyone who like country music . it is a very well-written book , with many interesting fact about country music . i have not read it in year but i plan to when my child are older . my 12 year old like to listen to country music . the book is in the book category and wa my first choice . i would have given it 5 star if it wa in the poetry category . the only thing that i did not appreciate wa the fact that the author wrote the music of country music a country music instead of country music . i personally prefer the former because it doe not feel like everyone is a country music fan .
0	this is a great song . i have listened to this song countless of time and it always get me .
1	this is an amazing album but i think it is better than most of his other album .
1	this is another great worship song .

0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this wa a great buy ! i have all of his other album , but this is the only one i have bought and it did not disappoint , it just wasnt my favorite . i did not like the vocal on this album though , they were too high in some of the song , but the rest wa good .

1	i bought this album to give to my friend who is a big elvis fan . i have been giving copy of i wan na be your lover to my friend who like elvis since high school .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i have heard this song a few time on the radio , but have never seen this song played on any television show or album . i like this version more than the one i have heard so many time before . this is actually the first time i have ever heard the song sung by a woman .

1	this app wa so helpful to my son when he wa a baby . he loved it and i loved having it .

1	barbra streisand singing is just great , i like the way she sings !

0	this is an overpriced , overproduced album . it is just a bunch of song that are just bad . there is nothing that can be said about it . it like the music video for papa wa a rolling stone only with a couple track and a few dance track . i think that the band should be ashamed of themselves for making this .
1	my son like to play this cd on his ipod . he love it .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	lorde really doe this song justice . lordes voice and style are so unique and beautiful . ( random reviewer )
0	the sound quality is poor . the music is ok , but the sound is very poor .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

1	i am a big fan of this . it is my favorite of the two .
0	this is one of those song that only a few people could appreciate it , and there are many who do not . it is really great , but not everyone ha the same concept of what a good song is . i like the way the song is structured , and the way the word are sung . it make me feel different than i would normally feel . the only thing i do not like is that there is no vocal on the outro . i do not like that .

1	this is an amazing recording of beethoven fifth symphony . it is good to have a recording of it , but not on this level . i had listened to it so many time a a young child that i could play it perfectly from memory , but this is so much more beautiful , nuanced , and dynamic than anything i have ever heard . i am not familiar with anything that come close . for this level , this is amazing .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i am not a huge fan of miley cyrus , but this song is amazing !
1	i really love this song , it is very catchy and bruno mar is a great singer !

1	this is one of the best country song i have ever heard . it is a great way to get out of your own way . it is about a guy who is a little too lazy to get out of his own way . he is a real downer . he make it more difficult for everyone around him . this is a great song to listen to when you want to get out of your own way .

0	the song is so good i am going to buy the cd .
0	this is a really bad cd , i do not like the song and i do not like the cd case .
1	i am so glad i got this cd and not the cd . it is not a bad song , but it is not the best song or worst song on this cd . i wa hoping for a new song or two , but i am still very happy with this cd . i have been listening to this song for year . i like it , but not the best song on this cd .
0	i have a cd of this song . i have a cd of a lot of song by this band . to me it seems like a song by an old band that wa popular in the 70 and 80 . not a good song .
1	wow . i am not sure what it say about me that i am surprised by this . i am happy to see that there are still people out there who are willing and able to purchase and own the kind of music that i like , and i am pretty sure that i will be purchasing this cd . i am also happy to see that it is actually not that expensive . i know that cd are always getting cheaper , but to me , this is a great deal .

1	she is still the same in her 70 a she wa in her 30 . love her style , her look , and her voice .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	barbras album is a compilation of her early work . it is a really good album , but i do not think it is barbras best work . i love her voice and would love to be able to hear her in concert , but i do not think this will happen anytime soon .
1	i like all of the song on this album very much . i would have to say the song are very original . the only thing i could be happier with is the way you do the vocal . it is just like you are having fun singing these song . the music is beautiful and the vocal do not sound forced .
0	it is one of the better cover . i really like it . the song is not the same a the movie but it is not bad either . i do not like the cover itself but i guess that is me .

1	this is a great collection of song . dave play the guitar like a steel-guitar . he ha a great voice and is a very talented song writer . this is a great collection of song from the beach boy . i buy all their album , i always get the one i like the best . i wa amazed when this wa on cd . it wa not a cd that you would have thought would have sold . it wa a cd that one would have gotten for free . i wa amazed with the quality of the album . i like the cd and would buy it again .
1	the best album of the 90 .
1	an enjoyable album with a great song on it . it the album that you wanted to listen to from start to finish . i do not know if it is my personal taste , but i have tried to listen to most of the album released by this artist and this is the album i like the best . i am sure that the trance album will be better than this , because it is more of a rock album , but i really enjoyed this album .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

0	the clash were one of the first punk band to really use their music a a statement about society and politics . the clash are a great band and this album is a good representation of what it mean to be a punk . the album is a mix of punk rock and reggae and the band really put good lyric and production on this album . the music is great .

1	i think it is time - one of our most popular single ! this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney and released in march 1964. the beatles were famous for their music , not their look . this wa the first time john and paul were able to write what they wanted to write . this wa the beatles first time to sing with each other . i am sure this song is a very personal story from john and paul . it is not a simple love song . it is a very powerful story . it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real female perspective ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real female perspective ! it is a real female perspective ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real female song . it is a real female perspective ! it is a very powerful song ! i think this song is a great song . i think this song is a great song . i think this song is very good ! i think this song is a very good song ! i think this song is a very good song that is very much like the beatles ! i think this song is a great song . i think this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney . i think this song wa written by john lennon and paul mccartney . it is a very powerful story ! it is a very powerful song ! it is a very powerful song . it is a very powerful song . i think this song is a great song . i think this is a great song . i think this song is very good . i think this song is very good ! i think this song is very good ! i think this song is a real woman song ! i think this song is a real woman song ! it is a very wonderful song ! it is a very wonderful song ! i think this song is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . i think this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman sing ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . i think this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! i think this song is a great song ! i think this song is a great song ! i think this is a very good song ! i think this song is very good ! it is a very good song ! i think this song is a very good song ! it is a real woman song ! it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . it is a real female song ! it is a real female song ! it is a real female song ! this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song . this song is a real woman song . this song is a real woman song . it is a real woman song ! this song is a real woman song ! this song is a very good song ! this song is a great music ! this song is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! it is a very good song ! it is good music ! i think this song is a good song ! i think this song is

0	i don´t like this song at all .
0	i like the music of this band , but i am having trouble connecting with it . i like the production and the sound , but the lyric are a bit of a stretch for me . i do not know that i could say that i relate to the music , but i do like the lyric . i like the music , but i do not think i could live out that lifestyle . i am a pretty private person , so the music doe not really do it for me .
0	i am not sure about this cd . i have purchased a few cd from this artist and always liked his cd . this wa by far the worst in my opinion
1	i bought this app because i wanted to read to my 6 year old daughter . she just turned 3 year old and i wanted to give her a reading that would keep her interested . unfortunately , while i wa listening to this song , her attention wandered to the screen and she turned the ipad off and on . after a few minute , the song wa over , but i did not know why and decided to return it . i did not . i have never received a single negative review of this app . many people have said it the best way to read to toddler because you can do it on the ipad and it will not get in the way of the reading . i am very happy with the app and have recommended it to several of my friend who also have young child .
1	a great album to start you off off with . it is like a warm up before you go on to the next album . and once you have made that initial connection with a song it is hard to let go !
0	i do not know what his best song is . this song is not his best . i am not a fan of his .
1	i wa never a huge mariah carey fan until i heard this song , i will always love you . it make me cry . i love her voice . her music is so beautiful . i wish that she could still be alive . i wish that i could still see her . she sound so beautiful . i hope she will be still alive for my kid to see .
0	this song is ok but it is not really a great song .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i really enjoyed this cd . i am a big fan of this group , and they really can turn any song into a great song .
0	good song , except the vocal just seem to lack the energy and confidence . maybe this is due to the fact that they were recorded at such a low quality . but the song is still fun . i like the chorus and the guitar work .
0	i bought it because i really like this song !
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i think this is one of the best song in the collection . the only reason i did not give it a higher rating is because it is just so much better . ohearns vocal , the harmonica , and the drumming all work well together and give it a very unique and fresh sound . i like every song in this collection , but i think this is one of ohearns best .
1	sam sparro is a good jazz musician that is influenced by the great like benny goodman . he is a very talented musician and a musician to watch . his sound is great .
1	there are some great song here , but most are from the 20 th century . a beautiful and unusual collection . each song is a gem , a treasure .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	i have always loved this song . i have been married to my husband for 15 year . i can not say enough good thing about this song . i wish i could get the cd so i could listen to it again and again .
0	i like this cd . it is good , but i have no idea why the producer chose to put in the song that were so bad . the production sound terrible , and the song are not very good . i do not understand why he did it . i do not like him , but i do not want to burn this cd .
0	i love this album .
0	i feel like i am a little late to the party , but i wa looking for something to listen to while working out , and this wa it . i wa looking for something different from the typical trance/dance music i listen to on the radio . i bought this album , and it is absolutely worth the money . i will be listening to it for a long time . there is nothing to complain about .
1	one of the best . great song .
1	i like this album a lot , but i am going to be honest with you- it is not my favorite . but it is ok. and i hope itll get more exposure , because i really like it .
1	i think this is one of the best recording of beethoven fifth symphony . i would love to play it on any instrument . the instrumentation is excellent . the instrumentation is so clear that it is amazing . there are no problem with the sound quality and the recording is excellent . it is a great recording .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	it is a classic song , but i do not know if i want to hear it played over and over for the rest of my life . i love it , but . i have always liked it , so i do not know if i would like it sung back to me again .
1	i love the original version of this song . i just bought the cd for my boyfriend and i. i like the chorus , but the music just doe not grab me . i like the music , but the song just is not that great .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i wa introduced to hasselvander by john peel . i have not listened to his music since that time , but there are some great recording on this album . he ha a way with word .
1	i am impressed with the sound quality of this album . this album is not a detailed a the previous one . it ha a great sound . the opening is very easy to listen to . it ha a lot of variety . this is a good album for listening to on the car .
0	the cd wa good , but it is not a good way to help her relax . the song on this cd were very soothing . the song on this cd were good . the song did not go with the theme of the cd . the song on her cd were better on another cd . the song on her cd were better on another cd .
1	i like this song . it is a good way to wake up in the morning .
0	this song . it is good but the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is inconguous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker , and this is far from rock . i am not a big fan of this kind of song .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	the album is very strong and heavy . it ha a heavy , but very good guitar sound , a very good drum sound and a very good bass sound . i would say this album is a little more metal then most punk rock album . this is not a bad album . i would say this is a very strong album .
1	this song is a great song , this is the second song i have downloaded from amazon . i have listened to a lot of song and this is one of the best !
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	this collection ha all the song from the movie ! it is a great collection . i wa very pleased . i wish there wa more song and album like this one . this collection is really beautiful . i give it a 9/10 .
0	i think this is the best uptown funk song . i like the way it go .
1	i think this song is better than the piano version .
0	this album is very very good , i really like the song on this album , the best song in this album are moody and underground and the lyric on this album are very very good . i really like the lyric on this album .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i really love this band . i have been a fan of the band since i first heard them on the radio . i would love to hear more song from next album .
0	i like him .
0	this disc is so generic . it wa more of a rock cd . i do not know what it is called , but it wa really generic . i do not know why i bought this disc . i like the song , the greatest show on earth . i do not know how it came up , but i have it in my collection .
1	i like my iphone but i need more battery life .
0	i like the lyric and the music and everything is good but i do not like the song . i could not understand the meaning . it is very difficult to understand . i think it is not the best song to listen to .

0	this is keiths song about his mom . i wish he would get over her . i only wish he would get over her because she wa not a good person . i want to see him do better .
1	i have bought this cd a lot and i like it .
0	there are some really good song on this album . i love from me to you and and i love her . i have to say , this album is definitely better than the white album , and that is saying something .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i like this song !
1	this is the last beatles album recorded by john lennon . this is the last album with all member of the beatles . it is also the last album where george harrison play an instrument .
0	i am not sure i can say much more than that . these are good , but certainly not excellent . it is well done , but not memorable . it is still better than most of the christmas album i have listened to . very good . good enough that it get my vote , but not good enough to get me to buy it again .
0	this is a great cd . i have listened to it several time . i have been trying to find an album that ha a song in it that will help me fall asleep . this ha done the trick . a a matter of fact , it ha gotten me to sleep quicker than i have in many year . i will be buying more of her cd .
0	i am not a big fan of this album . there wa nothing really exceptional about it . it is not bad , just not anything to get excited about .
0	she ha a potential to be really good .
0	this is an interesting song . i like the instrumentation and the harmony . the lyric are very good . i think this cd might have a lot of potential .

1	this is a great song , but i do not think it is a good song . i like the song , but i do not think it is a good song . it is a fun song to listen to . i like the song a lot . i would rate it a 5/5 .
1	this is a very good collection of song . some of the song that i liked were : in a sentimental mood , this old guitar , a girl like you , you have changed my life , some day you will know my name , i will be seeing you , you are the one i want , the first time ever i saw your face , i will remember you , there is no other way to say it , i wa just kissing you , i have got the blue , i still love you , and i have got a brand new love . i did not like the song that i did not like or that i felt were just filler , such a the song that i did not understand . i like the sound of the song , but i do not understand them . i do not particularly like the song that i did not like or that i did not understand .
0	i bought a david lee roth album on amazon . i did not know it wa a mess . now i do . the vocal are awful . the guitar is good . the song are good . i am glad i got it . it is not terrible . it is just a mess ! i bought this album so i could learn how to play guitar .
1	i have been a fan of the dave clark five since they began in the early 1970s . this cd is a very good representation of the best of the dave clark five . the song are very well-crafted and i like the way they are mixed together in a collection of song . i am surprised that this cd wa released so soon after the last one . so i hope that we will continue to see more of dave clark five record and hope that he will continue to tour .
0	i do not really know what to say about this one . it is just okay . it is not too good , but it is okay . i do not really like anything on this one .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	this make me feel better every time i hear it ! i can only imagine how the song wa to be sung , and the lyric are so powerful and inspiring . i wa sad the person who wrote this song wa killed in an accident , but i am glad that they were able
0	good overall song . the chorus is not a good a the verse but it still ha some nice moment .
0	this is a very good album . the song are very good . the music is very good and the lyric are very good . i have heard a lot of grateful dead song and i really liked this album . it ha a very good sound quality . the only bad thing is that the song are too long and you have to listen to them over and over again to get the full effect of the song .
1	i listened to this album a few time when i wa a teenager and have been a huge fan of his ever since . this is the best ohearn album i have ever heard and it ha some of the best song . i have all his album and all his single . i would highly recommend this album to anyone who love music .

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i am a very big fan of the album and my favorite song is when i look to the star . the next song i like is how do i tell . i can not really say that this song is a keeper because i do not think i have any of my favorite song on this album . but , it is a good song and i like the way it is written .
1	bonnie raitt is an amazing singer . i have been listening to her music for so long that i probably am just now starting to get into it . i think state of trance is a great album , but this is even better .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	this is a great song . it is a real song that you can listen to and it make you feel like you are in church . i like it better than the original . i think the original is better . the movie is better . but this song is better . it is very good .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this song is pretty good . i like the song and the music video too . i like the song . i like the song and the video . i like the song a lot . i like the song the music video too . i like the song . i like this song . i like the song . this song is pretty good . i like the song and the song video . i like the song a lot . i like the song and the music video too . i like this song a lot . i like the song . i like the song . i like the song . the song is pretty good . i like the song . i like the song . this song is pretty good and the music video is
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !

0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	it is a shame that the cd is not a good a the original lp , and the original lp wa released in 1980. the version of rock on is not the original recording . there is no way to tell if the version on the cd is the original version or a studio version . what i can say without a doubt is that this is one of the best album out there . the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1981 or 1982. this cd wa released in 1981 , so you had to get it in 1982. the song are a good a any other dave clark five album , but the original album wa released in 1980 , so you had to get it in 1982 .
0	this song is really not my cup of tea . i know it is not one of her best , but it ha to be up there for her .
0	a live recording from a live gig . only one good thing to say about this live recording . it is very similar to a tom wait live recording .
0	i bought this cd to hear the new material she play live . it is a decent cd but not worth the money . i wish i would have known about it before i bought it . i am not sure why she did not put song on the cd that i already have cd of . i would have bought the cd anyway , but i would have bought it sooner . it is a great cd , but i think she should put more song on the cd .
0	i just really love this song . i have tried to find a song to match it and i have not been able to find one . i like it for what it is . it is a little different , but it is very beautiful . i would have to say , however , that i did not like it . i do not think the lyric are very good . i like the melody and the song . i like the music a lot . i think it is a wonderful song .
1	i love this song . however , what really make me love this song is the fact that it is the only song that i can sing along with from my car to work . i know this is a very simple song , but it just hit me in the heart . i hope it doe the same for you .

1	i have been waiting for this album for over a year and a half now . i cant wait to hear it . this is a great album to listen to .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i have only just begun listening to e.s . posthumus and it is a very good cd . p.s .

0	i like this song a lot . i thought that this would be a good song to record a mix tape of . i am not sure about the mix however . it sound a little distorted and it doe not sound like a mix tape . it also ha a very distorted sound and a distorted bass . it sound like a mix tape that someone recorded live and then messed up .

1	this song is one of my favorite david lee roth song . i love the way he sings it . i just can not wait to hear his new stuff , because i am sure that it will be amazing .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	the album is good , but not outstanding . the first two song , i will be here and heavenly father are very good , but the song after that are just not a good . the first song , if my love were a river is nice , but the song after that , i will never find another you , is just plain boring .

0	the only thing i am not happy about is that i bought the cd for my husband for christmas . he love this album . he really like how the album start out but then he get bored with it .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i can not believe i have never heard this song . it is one of my favorite .

0	i do not know how to put into word how i feel about this . it is a good representation of american music at that time - the early 60 . when i first heard it , i thought that it wa a parody of duke ellington and his orchestra . for me it is the only example of ellington and company on the radio . it is actually a very good example of jazz a a whole . i feel that it is the very best recording of duke ellington orchestra . it represents the best of his work and it is a good representation of the 60 .
0	the original is so good , i am surprised this version is not more popular . the lyric are not clear at all , and the song is too short .

1	this is the classic song that introduced me to the term alternative christian music . i listened to this song on repeat a a child . i heard the song in my church nursery and listened to it a i got ready for sunday school . it wa always on in my little heart . my parent were always asking me to play it on a religious station at church before i went to bed . this song is one of the best song ever . i just love the melody and the message . it is awesome that this song wa recorded by a christian band , a christian group , not just a christian singer . i love the message of this song . this song is a blessing in my life . i recommend this song to everyone .

0	i bought a cd of bruno mar this past week and it wa a little disappointing , but i still gave it a 5 star . this album is beautiful and the album ha a wonderful quality . i have always liked this artist and i think this album will have some very good year .
0	the song on this album are great ! all of them are great ! however , the album ha a few flaw that i wanted to address . first , the album start out with blackbird and the next song is noel . how can you play blackbird when you already played noel a couple of song ago ? secondly , when is the last time you heard sister christian played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since i have heard it , which make me think it is not the band style anymore . finally , i do not like the fact that every song begin with a song called fade away . i know that is not a coincidence , but i like the fact that the first song is titled fade away and not fade away , or fade away . when is the last time you heard garden of earthly delight played in it entirety ? it is been about 5 year since garden wa released , which make me wonder if it is their style anymore .
1	i love this song ! i love bonnie . she is got a great voice . love the song .
1	this is the best cover of the original , so far !
0	i love this song because it is got such a great beat . i love the story on the side it tell about the love that wa lost between two people . i loved it when i wa a kid when i would come home and my father would be singing the song and i always thought wow , the song is just exactly what i want to hear at that moment in time . i think it is a beautiful song . the only thing i do not like about it is the video . the girl voice sound like a young girl . also the song end in the middle for some reason . but overall i think it is a great song .

0	my wife and i both love the dave clark five and jewel music . i have always loved jewel music and have enjoyed her album and her early song . i would like to have an album of their earlier song by them but i do not think it will ever happen because the song have already been recorded . i want to be able to listen to their song when i am not looking and have not heard them .
1	this song is so cool . i have been listening to this song for so many year , but i just figured out that i have never heard it before . i can not believe that i have never heard it . it is a very cool song . i hope you all like it .
1	i bought these and they are great . the song are great and the packaging is perfect .
1	i like the song and i like the album , i like it because it is very catchy and it is different from the other one on the album . i like the fact that gnr wa inspired by the movie groundhog day . i think that this song is the best on the album .

0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i love the bluesy playing on this cd . but it is a shame that there are no guitar solo or any other instrumental track on this album . it would have been nice to hear a little more variety in the instrumental music . and i wa really surprised to find out that the song this is not a song for the noun is actually in 3/4 time and not 4/4 . i am sure there is a mistake in the book , but i like the song better in 1/4 . the other two song are both upbeat and have a nice rhythm to them . but at the end of the day , this is a cd for the blue .
1	this is another excellent compilation album . i have listened to it several time and it is a wonderful collection .

0	the song , praise be the lord , ha been stuck in my head for the past few day . it wa on the cd of wicked praise , which i purchased at the last second . i wa a little disappointed with it , but not for the reason you would think . it is a worship song and i feel it is a bit too upbeat for my taste . i am usually more of a slow and steady guy , so this just doe not do it for me . i will be checking out the other song on the cd , but i think this may be a case of too many cook spoil the broth .

0	a lot of people here say this is a great book ! i personally do not agree . it is a memoir of what it wa like to go on tour with a band that wa huge in the 80 and 90 . most of the book is just talking about that . i think an album like this should be about the music , not about the band .

1	i bought this cd for my dad and he love it . i think it is a really fun song to dance and put on .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i do not know what to say about this album . it is a good cover , but the album just doe not have the same emotional depth a the original . i will be buying the original .

1	i am a fan of the song , and i love the video . i think it is a great song , though it is not my favorite . i would give it a 6 .
0	the only thing that hurt this album is the vocalist . he is just terrible . i do like the song i will always be the last one on your list because it had a certain quality to it but the rest of the song just did not work for me .

0	i purchased this album last year after hearing some of the song on the radio and seeing the video of the album the one . i am not familiar with the name of the artist , but i am familiar with the song i wan na be loved and i thought this is a must hear album . i am a christian and i am very familiar with the word i wan na be loved by led zeppelin and the song is a great example of christian music and faith . this album is a good reminder to put a positive spin on thing .
0	i love this record . it is great ! i like it .
0	this album ha some great song , but the worst is the song i love you baby . it just doe not have any flow at all .
0	i really do not get why this song is on this album . it sound nothing like the other song on the album . the band never made an album called the best of the best . they had one album called the best of the best , and one album called the best of the best of , and one album called the best of the best of the best of the best of . that just doe not make any sense . i understand that they wanted to put a song with the title the best of the best of . but i do not think anyone ha ever heard it . i guess you can not please everyone , but they should have at least tried to make the song a little bit more original .
0	i have never heard this song , but i am looking forward to hearing it . it is on the album , and it is a live recording of the album . it is not the exact same recording , but wa from the tour .
0	i bought this album on cd . i could not find any of the song on cd . it ha been a while since this album wa released .
0	sam sparro - the guy name is sam sparro . he is the lead singer of the band , u-men . he is a nice guy who writes great song and sings very well . he is got a good voice and he is cute . he is a pretty good american boy who ha gone to japan and made a name for himself on tv . he is a nice guy , but he is not really very good .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .

1	i have had this song on my wish list for month now . i love it . i have never heard taylor other song , so i am excited to hear them .
1	i am pleased with this cd purchase . this cd is very nice . i like the sound quality and the lyric . it is nice to have a song that describes the feeling of the song . i can not wait to listen to the rest of the song . i have no idea what the other song sound like . i do have an mp3 player so i would like to know what the song sound like before i listen to them . i like the song , but i would like to know what they sound like . i am very impressed with what this cd ha and i would like to purchase the other cd i have purchased soon .
1	i loved the first album , but i wa so let down by the whole story . now , i am glad i bought this for my daughter . she like it , and i hope the whole story can be included on the next album .
0	i like the record , a is the song , but it seems a if there is a lot of filler on this album . a lot of the song lack any energy , and i can not quite figure out what they were trying to accomplish .

0	i think i like this song . i would listen to it again . i like it .
1	this song make me want to dance and sing . i wish i had this song in my collection . it is really good .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	what a great , fun album . i love it and will listen to it every day .
0	i wa a little bit disappointed to find out that this album ha been released with the same track a the album r & b music , vol . 1 ( aka r & b music , vol . 1 ) . i know the cover is different but i just do not think it is worth the cd to have the same cd a the previous one when the music is so different . i also do not agree with the r & b music , vol . 1 album being included with this cd . but if you enjoy the r & b a much a i , then you will probably love this cd and will probably buy it .
0	very poor . the band is not a very good live band , the sound is very unclear , and the vocal are almost inaudible .
0	my favorite song on the cd is the time is now . i listen to a lot of pop and i think this song is great . the lyric are also fantastic . it make me think about life and the future . i will be buying this again and again . it is a great song to sing along with . it ha a very nice piano sound to it and really a good chorus . if you are looking for a great song to sing with , you do not want to listen to this .
1	good version , good movie version .

0	barbra streisand is a great singer , but i am not a fan of her . i like the cover of this song , but the original is better .
1	this is a great song and i think it really cool to see the band performing this in it entirety .
0	this is a great song to listen to on a sunny day .
0	barbra doe not sing like a diva , she sings with a natural voice , but she doe not sing like a diva .
1	this is one of my favorite christmas album . i like all the song , and wa really impressed with how well the band sang . i would love to have more of their album , because their sound is different than most other christian artist . i give this album four star because it is a great christmas album .
0	this is the first time i have ever seen someone post a negative comment on any of my music . a i am a little biased on the album i am a huge fan of but i am glad that he is a fan of mine .

1	i have been listening to this album for year and i found it to be a very fine collection of classical music by some of the greatest composer of the 20th century . i am a huge fan of beethoven and have heard him in many of his live performance . i listen to this album several time a week and it brings me back to a happier time in my life when i could almost feel god presence in the music i heard .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this album is pretty self-explanatory , but i wanted to say a little something about the album cover . it wa a big hit in the 1990s , and the band wa the opening act for the who at the garden . the band wa one of the first to ever wear a cape ( a cape wa kind of a cool thing back then ) and they really looked cool when they did it .
0	i really like this song . i agree that miley need to stop lying about the drug she take . it is a shame she can not just be herself .
1	this song is pretty good . i like that it is a cover of a song that wa released in 1976. i do not know who wrote this song , but it is good .
1	this album is so good ! i love it .
0	i am not a fan of her song . i do not even know why i bought this cd . it is just so bland , and boring . i have heard her cd . i like her music . i like the cover . i would give it a 5 out of 5 , but i do not know why i bought it . it is just so bland . it is all about her . this is just one of those cd that i would never buy again .
0	this album ha good quality and it is really good . i like most of the song , but i think the last song tribute to the dreamer is very boring .
0	this song is really good . i like this one .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i love this song so much . if you are a lorde fan than you probably love this song , but if you are not then you probably do not .
1	i bought the cd from amazon for my wife . she really liked it . i am really happy with the cd .
0	this is a live recording from the 1970s , and includes the song i have actually heard the band perform . it is very , very rough , with the sound quality of a cassette . it is available for download through the music player on the itunes store . however , it is not a bad recording , just not great .
1	i love this song ! i like the way it start off . i like the way it end . i like the way i like it . it is a good song . i like it .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i love this song ! i have been listening to it since i first heard it . i love miley and i hope she doe not ever stop making music .
0	i think this is good .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	in this cd , you can hear the early recording of the music and the brain .
0	this collection is worth the price . i am not the biggest fan of dalios work , but i love the music in this collection . i have the first six on cd . it is a great collection . i love the music in this collection . i have the first six album on cd . it is a great collection . i love the first six album on cd . it is a great collection .
0	i bought the second disc of the album . i do not recommend it .
1	this is one of the best piece of music that i have ever heard . the musicianship is superb . the sound quality is very , very good . there is a very fine , long-playing version available on cd . i would like to have this on cd . i have been looking for it for many year .
0	wow , there is so much to say . this album is fantastic .
1	this is a really good cd . it ha a lot of great song and a lot good musician . it is a really good cd . but it is too short and i would like to have had more song . all song are fantastic , but i think the cd could have had a few le song . i am going to buy a new cd and this is great for the money . i would recommend this cd to a friend and buy it again when i have more money . it is worth buying . it is a good cd . i would recommend it to a friend .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	a decent live album . not amazing , but a good product .
1	i think i will definitely have to try this tape . it is one of the most unique and wonderful album i have heard in quite some time . i feel i will fall in love with this artist .
1	this wa the best hammond album i have heard in a while . i think many of the song are very good , especially the guitar based one . just wish the vocal were a little better .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i thought this wa a ballad . i almost bought it . but it is not . i thought it wa . but i am not . so i did not buy it . i like the song , but i am so glad that i did not listen to it . it seemed like it wa about an unhappy relationship . i did not want to listen to that . it made me feel like i needed to be with that guy .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is a cd from ponders first album . i have had a lot of his other album and have enjoyed them , but i have not really gone to his earlier album . i guess i am a little out of the loop and do not know what his previous album are like . anyway , i enjoyed this one . i like the way he doe the vocal . i like the style of many of his song .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	this song really get you going , it a great song .
1	it is a single album , however , i did get the album of song from the first release , lenfant . if you are looking for karajan , this is a good place to start .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this is a really great song ! very easy to listen to , and this version is not bad either . just add more guitar or piano solo and this song could be great ! i love this song and this is the first time that i have heard it .
0	i bought this for my sister and she could not get it to download , she ha to play it on her iphone . i gave it 3 star because of one word - unbelievable . the song is an old song by the dave clark five that we love , but we had no idea how much we could love , and how much we could hate .
0	i have always liked to change the song i listen to , but i have to say this is definitely my favorite song , and i love it . i love the word and the way the song go . it is a great song . i also like it because it is a good song to listen to when you are stressed out . i like it when it is a little more upbeat than other song because i can not play the song too loud .
1	i love this band . i love this cd .
1	i just love this song . i love lordes song . the song is so cool .
0	i am so excited to get my hand on this cd . i have been waiting for it for a very very long time now .
0	this album is good but it doe not have the heart and soul of steve morse . there is nothing wrong with this album but it lack a little bit of sparkle .
1	this is a great cd of folk music . it is the second cd in the folk anthology series , which contains all the album in the series . the first one wa just an album . i would say that this one is a little better . it ha more of a musical feel to it . i would say the other cd is good , but this one is better . i like the folk music here a lot . i just wish there wa more music . i am a little disappointed by the fact that we do not have more music . i am a little disappointed that we do not have any more music . i wish that there wa more music . i love it when something is released . i know that i do .
0	this album ha some good song and some bad song . i really do not understand what the problem is with the bad song . i would have to say the song that do not work well are the one i like the least .
0	what is this , springsteen ? there are some good song on here , but the album is just not very good . when you are in the middle of a bad day and want to forget about everything , this is a good album to listen to .
0	this is pretty much the greatest compilation tape ever made . the song here are all original , although they come from popular band . this is the perfect tape for those who are into heavy music , a well a for the people who want to hear something different .
0	i have had problem with this cd over the past two month . i ordered both of the brandy cd and the new wanya cd . they start immediately and play for about 10 minute . then they stop . the first one played for over 5 hour - i wa so frustrated that i ordered the second one - 5 minute later the same thing happened . i have tried both of the song twice - they played for half an hour each time . i have tried them on a 2 gig external hard drive and a 5 gig internal drive . i have tried them on a usb flash drive - same thing . i have had the flash drive hooked up to external hard drive in the past and it would play for several hour each time . i then tried them on a usb flash drive hooked up to the internal hard drive . the same thing happened . i have tried them on a different computer . it is the same thing . the only difference between the computer is that one ha win xp - the other ha window vista . i live in a very small town - i can not afford to have them sent to me from overseas . i wa so frustrated - i had to call tech support - and they told me they had to order the new cd from overseas and ship it to me in 3 day . i asked the tech support person to tell me how much that would cost . she said $ 14.00 plus shipping and handling . i could not afford that . i did not like the way they treated me . i have had problem in the past with them over the past two month . i like the song on this cd - it is a good cd - but it doe not play for more than a few second and then it pause and start over . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a new one again .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	it is not an album . the music is very good . i love the tune in this cd . the song are very nice . i like this cd . it is not the best cd i have purchased though . i do not know if it is because i have a weak memory or what . it is the cd that i used to buy every other year . these are my personal thought .

0	this is an excellent cd . it is a good collection of song , with some good song , and some that were not so good . the music is from the old school jazz and blue , and it is very well done . i have only listened to the cd once , and i think that i will buy it again and listen to it to make sure that it is everything that it is supposed to be .
1	i enjoyed this album and the lyric . it is the first time i have enjoyed music of this quality . it is got the sound of the 80 and i like it . this is my favorite album .

0	i would have given this album a 5 star rating , but it is just another eagle album . i do not think it is a bad album , but i do not think it is great either . and if you are going to listen to an eagle album , listen to the original first . the original have no filler , and they are all pretty good . the only thing on this album that is not on the original is new day . and the only bad song on this album is new day .

0	i am not entirely sure what to think of this . i do wish they had released the rest of the album in the set just a a single album . i am also confused by the fact that there is a dalio album at the end of the set . the rest of the set seems to be mainly classical music . the only reason i bought this whole set wa to get the dalio album . this album is so incredibly overrated . i am sure it is good , or at least ha great quality sound , but in my opinion the performance do not live up to the hype .

1	hasselvander writes very good music . the quality of the sound is excellent . the album is very well put together . ha
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .

1	this cd is the best in my opinion . i would recommend this cd to anyone who want to listen to classic rock . it a great collection of song all put together in a nice package . it is worth every penny
0	keith is a great guitar player , but this album is boring . this album is the antithesis of the keith side discography . it is full of simple repetitive riffing - i wish it wa a little more innovative and different .
1	i bought this cd when it first came out on cd and i listened to it for week . i have heard this cd on the radio a well a on my computer . i have never purchased anything from amazon.com before and this is the first time . i will purchase this cd again .
0	i would have given this a 4 rather than a 3 rating , but it doe not sound like it wa meant to be a ballad . the bass in this song is terrible . the vocal is ok , but the melody is terrible . the best thing on this album is you do not know me , but then the song is about a musician who want to be famous , but he doe not know what to do . the vocal are a little too high for me to enjoy it . the only bad thing about you do not know me ( and there are many bad thing about this album ) is that there is no chorus . the vocal on this song are a little too high for me to enjoy it . a new kind of love is a great song about a guy who is going to meet his wife on a blind date , and he doe not know what to expect . there are great song on this album , but the vocal are not really that high for me to enjoy them .
0	i can not believe i am going to say this but this album is bad . it sound like a cheap copy of a demo with different lyric ( which are in the cd case ) . i do like the vocal of this song , but the rest of the album is just disappointing . i could have paid $ 10 for this album , but i would have rather paid $ 30 .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky

0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i am the most disappointed of all the reviewer . you all have rated this song at 5 star . please rate this song at 1 star and call the song a poor job . how could you make such a song a 5 star ? i am disappointed . you will all rate this song a lower rating than i do .
1	the only reason i downloaded this cd wa because i had just made my decision to go back to school . i know i should have listened to the radio while i wa driving to school and listening to the music instead of just driving to school .

1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	a nice song . it is actually a pretty catchy song , but not the kind that could take a walk on the wild side , like the way you look tonight or frozen . it is nice to hear a song that is not a ballad .

1	the album wa a great buy . it is pretty much a mix of hit and the new stuff . i am not a huge fan of either of the two , but i am not going to complain about the band either . i still wish they would add their own music to their set . it would make it more like a live show . i like the new stuff , but i am having a hard time listening to these song without thinking of the band that covered them .

0	i wanted to return this product a it wa too heavy . i will be buying again in the future .
1	i really like this song . it is very good . i downloaded it for my friend to sing . they all love it .
0	this album is just a big rip off of nirvana and the beatles , not only of those band but of any band out there that is trying to get noticed . i do not understand how the man can get away with this . this is a total rip off of the beatles and nirvana !
0	i downloaded some.mp3s of this cd to practice for a country karaoke competition . a friend of mine gave it to me to download .

0	this is not a good cover . the song is not bad , but the cover is horrible . i am glad i bought this album . although , i wish they would have just made a real cover , like say , the damned .
0	this is so bad it is good .
0	i love this song , but i do not understand why it is not on the cd . this is the same song , but it wa not on the album . it is a better version though , so it is still good .
1	this is a good song .
1	a real good album .
1	the first trance album i bought with my own money , and i am really happy with it . the song are good and the production is really good . i can not say it is the best trance album , but it is a good album all the same .
0	the only way i could listen to this album over and over is to get an amplifier .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	this song is the worst . i can not believe i actually even like this song .
0	this cd is great ! it ha great song ! i would recommend this cd to everyone !
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i like it . i like it very much .
0	while the song is very well performed , i do not like the song . it doe not make sense to me , or to the listener . it is a good song , but i will not buy it again .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	it is one thing to listen to a cd of music by an artist you know and love ; it is another to have a cd that is a collection of song that you have never heard before . i do not know about anyone else , but i like the idea of discovering new music , but when it is a compilation of song that i have never heard , it is not a good thing .
0	i love dave clark five . i like hearing them play live .
1	this song is so overplayed at the gymboree that it is now a joke . if this were the kind of music that would be played in a film to create a theme or background music , i would be understanding . but this is a generic , boring song ( except for those opening chord ) , which get no applause .
0	this is a nice cd of christmas carol . i think it is a very good cd . i do not think it is worth the price . i think christmas is a time of giving , not buying . you can buy a cd that is well done , well arranged , and unique . this doe not . i would have liked to have bought it for my grandkids . it is good to have something new to listen to . i do not think it is worth the price . i would not buy it again .
1	this is a fine cd , one of the best i have heard this year .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i love this cd , and i love tom scott .
1	after a few listens to this cd , i can not believe i did not know this woman wa a great musician before now . she ha an incredible voice , and she doe an awesome job on the guitar . i have been a huge fan of her song since her first album , the best of jewel . this cd is definitely the best that she is ever done , and i am really glad that i got this cd instead of her previous cd . her playing is incredible , and i would definitely recommend this cd to anyone , especially people who are into music . this cd is excellent , and i can not wait to give it to my friend . it is an excellent cd , and i am really glad i got it . i thought it wa the best jewel album that she ha done , and i will definitely be buying more jewel album from now on .
0	i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
0	this album is a great listen , but the song that people are saying are over-produced are some of the best in the band catalog . i do not like how some song have the same note repeated , and i think it ruin the song . the best thing is that this album is a good mix of song .
1	i do not think this song is very talented . it ha no real meaning to it .
1	really enjoyed this album . i did not expect it to be a good a it wa .
0	this cover is not worth the price . the song is ok , not great . it seems like it would have been better with a different guitar .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	awolnation is a great song , but awol is a little boring .
1	i just wanted to give this cd a quick listen , but i can not . it is awful . i do not know what she wa thinking putting
0	i just bought this album and i am very excited . i think this album is better than the singer previous album . she is still very good , but i think the last two album have been better . i think she is not really that great of a singer , but she doe have some very good song . i have not listened to all the song yet , but i do not think there is anything off-putting . the album is a little more country , a little more rock , but i still think it is a good album .
1	this is really good . it is fun to listen to the whole thing .
1	this collection of recording is excellent . i enjoyed listening to the complete dixieland story cd . the collection doe not have enough recording of the chicago symphony orchestra .
1	i loved this song , great lyric , great music .
0	this song is a very good song , but i am not sure the vocal are what make this song , it is the beat . it is good , but i can not say the vocal are the icing on the cake for me . it is a good song , and a good version ( for being an old classic ) .
0	i bought this for my husband to enjoy and listen to while driving . he love to listen to the radio in the car and is more into music than i am . i hope to eventually listen to this album while i am off work so that i can listen to it while i am working . i am very impressed with what i have purchased so far .
1	this is my new favorite song . i love all the song on this album .
0	i love this song , and the entire album . very easy listening , with some heavy sounding vocal and a lot of guitar . i have always loved the hard rock sound that reo speedwagon ha always made , and i always thought they were underrated .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this song suck .
0	i would give this a thumb down . i am not a fan of country music , but the song is not so bad . it is just not catchy .
1	i have been a fan of this band for a
1	i have never heard this cd before , and i had no idea it wa a christmas cd . i am a big fan of christmas song , and this is one of my favorite . i would recommend this song to anyone who like christmas music . it sound great , and it ha a great beat .
0	i do not like the song , i know the album you are talking about but this song is not my favorite either .
1	this cd wa absolutely amazing . it ha a lot of great song . the song are all different and interesting . the most interesting wa i want to be the boy i always dreamt i would be .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i have a problem with this album , and i am not sure why . i think it is the vocal . there is nothing i can say about them that can not be said better in the word of the song . i do not like the lyric , either . they are too long , too repetitive , and have nothing to do with the content of the song . i do not care what people say about this record - it is the best sam sparro album i have heard .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )

0	i just discovered this cd . i will listen to it again and again !
1	i love to listen to this song . the word are very positive .
1	barbra can sing .
0	so , the movie good but this song is bad . i like this song and it is not bad but it is overused . i like the movie better than the song .
1	i really enjoy listening to bonnie raitt and i wish i could listen to her live . i bought this cd because i read in amazon review that the cd wa great and it wa easy to get a cd copy . i did not listen to the cd until today . i wa not disappointed at all . it is one of the best cd i have ever heard .
1	the recording in this cd collection are so well done . everything ha been recorded with such care that you can hear the string , woodwind , brass , and percussion . it is a real pleasure to listen to these recording . i have listened to many performance of the overture and never have i heard it recorded in such a manner that is so clear and in it glory .
0	the lyric are pretty . the melody is awful . the lyric are ok. the instrumentals are ok .
1	i love all of their song .
1	i downloaded jewel for a country karaoke competition because i like country karaoke
1	this album is amazing . it go beyond a great tune to a truly memorable album .
0	hymn is a good song . i wa a little disappointed to see that there wa no lead vocal performance throughout the song . however , i did enjoy the lyric and the vocal work by the vocalist . i will definitely listen to the rest of the album .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i have not listened to this album in a while , a i moved on to other stuff , but i had to write this one . i wish i had found this album last year . it would have been a must have for me .

1	this song make me feel good . it is a great song .
0	this album is an excellent collection of tune , but i am not a fan of the album . i have heard so many other excellent album . this album would have been better if it had been a collection of track instead of a collection of song .
1	this album is my all time favorite . i love it and the song is one of my favorite song of all time .

1	i think this song is a good song . the beat is good .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !

1	i am new to amazon and have ordered most of the cd i have come across . this is the first time that i have listened to an mp3 cd . this one is a little bit tough to listen to because there are alot of voice and a great song but i am not sure why it is so loud ( i am on the stereo set ) . this is a great way to learn a new song .

1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i really wanted to like this album . although , i did not , i like the music and i think it is a good album . most of the song are nice and fun to listen to and some of the song are really good , but i could not get into the album , especially the first half of it .

1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	in a time when many were afraid to speak out against the vietnam war and the government lie , this song could be a powerful weapon . the lyric are very powerful , inspiring courage in the listener . a little on the political side , but not to the point of being offensive . a nice and soothing song .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

0	i have the whole cd and i do not want to get rid of it , but it is a waste of time . it is a lot of old , old song that do not make any sense . most of them are about love and sex and drug and alcohol , and i can not stand them . they do not make any sense , and they are nothing like the song on the album .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	the original lyric are good , but the song is not about my father is a dick . the song is about how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not want to love him , and how he feel when he is having sex with someone who doe not believe him .

0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is my first ever album and i liked it . i have to say this album is a very good mix of song .

1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	this album is excellent . i love the recording . you have to hear them to truly understand the musicianship they represent . the music is superb . it is not difficult to see why this album ha received such acclaim . steve morse wa one of the greatest and most talented organist of his time . this is a must have for any hammond fan , and for anyone interested in the history of the instrument . this album is a must for any hammond fan . this album is a classic and a keeper . i would recommend this to everyone .

0	a better song than the last one .
1	this is a good cd . i have listened to it and it is good . i like
0	i love this song so much . i have only played it once . it is a beautiful song and a beautiful way to end a christmas album .
0	this is a live version of her first album when she wa a solo artist , but it is not good enough to warrant purchasing . it is a live cd by jewel .
0	i can not believe no one ha mentioned the music from this movie . that is some of the best music from any movie .
1	i have already purchased a couple of album , and this is right up there . i love the lyric and the music and the beat , and i think i will continue to buy this album in the future .

0	i do not have the patience for one of these .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	she is a very talented artist . it is hard to believe that she ha only been in this business for a short time .
0	i am not sure if i wa expecting this to be any good but i am glad i ordered it . if you are not a fan , i would say go with something else . i am not complaining , i am just telling you that i did not know what to expect . i thought i would be bored or have only a slight interest in it . i do not understand why it is so hard to make music that is not a derivative of other music .
0	i am not sure i like the remix , but the original is absolutely amazing . i downloaded the free mp3 because i wa going to use it for a country karaoke competition . i downloaded the free version because i read a lot of good review about it . i am happy with it . i downloaded it to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple . i only wish the artist had a facebook fan page instead of just a website . i love when the artist work is posted on facebook .
1	this album ha a great selection of worship music . the song that i like most are praise & gratitude , savior , one pure and holy passion , holy spirit , and jesus . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of worship and praise song . i like the song that are not only worship song , but also praise song , and i like the song that are inspiring and uplifting .

1	great cd . i have only listened to it one time but i wa amazed at how good it wa . i like all the song . they are all good .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me

1	at first i did not understand why i should buy this cd . i wa even a little disappointed . i then realized i should buy this cd because the song are better than most of the cd i have listened to at this time . i have listened to this album so much , i feel i have it memorized . i listen to this cd over and over again , and i do not know what more to say . ( except that it is a good cd and i really like )
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this is the most relaxing song i have ever heard . i love it .
1	this is an excellent compilation . i have listened to the album several time and have enjoyed every song . i highly recommend this cd to everyone .

1	when i first heard this song , i wa enthralled . i wa in awe by the melody , the way it seemed to have a beautiful melody and yet not overwhelm the listener . it just sounded so beautiful . i have listened to it numerous time and each time i am left satisfied . i have not met a single person who doe not like it .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	good album . it wa my first album of the year and it is worth buying . it ha a little bit of everything . i have bought three album by this artist and can say that every song is excellent .
1	i like jewel music . i love the first two song on her new cd and the music video is great . i love the music video though . i also really like this song . i think i am going to listen to it a lot .

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	it is not your everyday girl from the 80 . she is very different .
0	this wa the best version of the ballad of frankie and johnny . it is a great song and the lyric are great .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i love this song . it is a true reflection of what it is like to be young , in love and on the road full time .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i bought a couple of these cd a gift . i wa very happy and surprised to find that all the cd have been returned . i did not have a problem with them . i have had good experience with cd and service . i would buy another cd and have done so since . i would also recommend this site to anyone i know who want an easy and reliable way to purchase cd .
1	i love this song . it is sooooooo good ! i love the melody and the lyric . what a great combination of the two . i have always loved this song and have been meaning to buy this cd for age . i have been listening to it a lot during my workout lately and will be buying the cd and amazon gift certificate .
1	this is the most beautiful version of this song i have ever heard .
0	i am a huge fan of miley cyrus . this is one of her best album . i am so excited to get her cd .
0	i got this collection after only paying $ 9.95 for the cd and $ 4.95 for the booklet . it is full of great music and full of great performance . i have not listened to this whole collection yet , but i have listened to most of it .
1	this is one of the best cd player . i wa looking for a great player for
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i am from the uk so i do not understand this at all .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i wish this song would have come out two year ago .
1	i would suggest this
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	my favorite song on this album is i dreamed a dream . the song is very well sung and i like the guitar sound . i am surprised this album will not go all the way to the top of the list . the album ha a very positive and happy tone and i really enjoy it .
1	“ the blue wa a style that wa invented by the black man . the blue is the best form of music of the age . it is music of the soul . it is music of the heart. ” the blue is a musical expression , not a strict genre . the blue is a kind of music that ha it root in african music but ha been influenced by black and white music and culture . the blue is the universal music of the american people . it is music that can be heard across all boundary and from all culture .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	a great song , which i have never seen before . it is a good song , not rock . i like sam sparro .
0	i did not think i would like this album since it is so old , but i am enjoying it this time around . it is a good old classic . my favorite are one pure and holy passion and he is a man . they are both very powerful song . i would recommend it to all christian music fan .
0	not a fan of trance at all . i am not sure if this album is for me . it is not bad , but it is not great either . i do not think that i would listen to this again . there is a lot of repetitive song on the album , but that is not my problem . the song are just okay . the production is pretty good .
1	i wa surprised by barbra streisand voice . it is very clear but it is not bad . it is not her best but it is not bad .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i can understand why this song is considered a song about being a woman . it is written in a feminine way . and it is a woman song . i think it is a song about a woman and her need and desire . it is a real female perspective . it is a woman song for a woman . it is a woman song for woman . it is a woman song for woman . it is about a woman and her need and desire . it is the real woman . it is the real female perspective .
1	this song made me feel like i wa on a spaceship .
1	i did not know this record existed until recently . i am glad i did . i do not enjoy classic rock but i do enjoy the occasional classic rock album . this is one of them . it is a nice mix of oldie with some new song . it is a very short listen but well worth it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	a a fan of the dave clark five , it wa great to finally get their music on cd after many year . the song are very enjoyable , and the production is great .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is a great compilation . it ha several different track , one with four song each , but most of the song are great . i like the cover of back in the u.s.s.r. , i love the whole album .

1	i started listening to her before i even knew i wa a fan . i started in the middle of a big tour and then went back and listened to it when i got home a few month later . i love her music . i always thought she wa just a singer , but now i know she ha a lot to offer in the world of art .
1	miley really is an amazing singer and a great artist . i love this song .

1	this is a good album , but the song lyric are too long and the song is way too repetetive

1	this album came today and i am so happy to have it ! i love it ! this album is amazing and i will never get tired of listening to this album ! this is definitely a trance album that will be around for a long time to come !
0	this album reminded me of a lot of other great album , but i can not name them .
0	this is the best collection of ansermeets recording i have ever heard . it is a must have for any fan of ansermet or classical music in general .
1	i love the song and love how happy and positive it is .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this is not an awful cd . i love this song . however , i bought it for my nephew birthday , and it wa a terrible waste of money . the cd is nothing more than a cd of your son saying , i love you . this is not how a cd should sound . i will never listen to this cd again . the audio quality is very poor . the sound quality on this cd is atrocious . this is not an average cd . this is not a cd of a child with a bad disposition . this is someone with an inferior brain . this is a cd with a poor recording quality . i do not think this is a good cd , and i do not think it should be on the market . i do not think there is any way to improve the audio quality of this cd . i feel like i am listening to a dead cat on a speaker . this is the worst cd i have ever heard . the lyric are horrible , the audio quality is horrible , and the sound quality is terrible . this is the worst cd i have ever heard . the audio is horrible and the sound quality is horrible . this is one of the worst cd i have ever heard . i bought this cd because my nephew told me i had to have it . i love this cd . i love the idea of a cd with beautiful music , and i love the idea of i love yous and i miss yous . however , the cd is not that . the cd is a cd with a dead cat on a speaker . i think this cd is worthless . i am a very hard-core cd collector , and i will not listen to this cd . i do not care about the music , but i do care about the cd . i feel bad for my nephew , but i do not feel bad for myself .

0	very good album . the album is very well put together in a way that make it stand out from the rest and i would recommend it .
0	this album ha a lot of great song and i like them all , and the lyric .
1	this is a great song . i love the lyric . the music is awesome , very fun and energetic , but can sometimes become a little monotonous . i like it when different theme are used .
1	i discovered this group on the internet . i am not a fan of this band but i liked their music . i like the way they sing and the way
1	bought this album because of what it represented . i saw this album for the first time a a kid , and wa blown away by this music . i have always loved the band , and i have always loved their music . i would recommend this album to any fan of the band . this album represents everything the band is about .
1	i really enjoy the song on this cd . i really enjoy the song homesick because my daughter ha been backpacking for a month and ha been homesick for her home . i hope the song homesick will encourage my daughter to come home .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	this song is a great ballad . i have always liked it . the lyric are beautiful and have a great message .
0	the song and the video are very cheesy . i like this song better when it is not put on a loop and when it is just the one song .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this song could be a hit , if only because of the harmony . the song is well written and ha a great sound .
1	sam sparros i do not wan na play that song is a great song that is well-written , catchy , and ha a great beat .
0	the song is okay , i guess . not bad . no real standout , however . i think this is an okay song . it ha a good beat . the lyric are ok. i do not think they were written just for the purpose of the video . they are about life and death and stuff . the video is pretty simple . the only thing that really stand out is the lighting . it look really bad . i do not like it one bit . the song itself is okay . i think . it is sort of average , but that is about it . i do not know . i do not know . it is not bad . i do not really know what to say about this song . it is okay , but it doe not have any real stand out feature . it is not good . i do not know what to say about it . i guess it is a decent song anyway . but it is pretty plain . i guess . i do not really know . i do not know . i just do not like it . it is not good .
1	i love jon lord , especially when he is doing his the police thing . i wa a huge fan of his before he left the band and i hope he stay .
0	this is the first karajan recording i have ever heard . i wa hoping for more of the same , but ala . the piano playing is very good for the time period , but the singing is not . karajan sings with a high voice and a low voice , which make it difficult to sing along with him . he also make mistake in the lyric , which can be heard and the listener can not help but point them out . i have heard many recording that sound like this , and i usually do not like them . when i had this album i did not like it , but i like it now .
1	the track on this album are very well-produced and very enjoyable . i am very impressed with the song selection and the quality of the album itself .
0	this is not a very good song . i have seen it a few time , and it always make me smile .

0	excellent ! this is a very good compilation of trance music . it is well done , and the track are very well done . i like the mix of trance track on this album . this is not a greatest hit album , this is a complete album . the mix is fantastic on all the track . this is a great compilation of trance music .
1	this song reminds me of the song i will be home from the movie fury .
0	i like it .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i love this band
0	this is her first album . it is good , but not great . i think she ha more to come from here .
1	i just saw a tom wait concert about a year ago and it wa an awesome show . it wa great to see someone my age sing his song ! i wa hooked on his music for about 5 day after that . i will never forget that concert . thank you for introducing me to tom wait !
1	i have only ever heard this recording , but i have never heard a better recording of the chicago symphony orchestra . this is great . i love it . this is the best recording of the best orchestra i have ever heard . this is the best recording of the chicago symphony orchestra . i have only ever heard this recording , but i have never heard a recording of the
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	this song is great !
0	this is a cd that i have enjoyed listening to . i am a big fan of ponder and do not want to see him do another cd that is just filled with song that are just worship song and not a mix of song that have both praise and worship . i would like for ponder to do a cd called the greatest . he ha done an amazing job . i would like for him to do a cd with song that have both praise and worship in them and not just one or the other .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i saw the broadway production of fiddler on the roof last night . it wa a good show , but it had no energy . the show started in the middle of a slow song and i do not think the show would have been any good without it .
1	i have got to stop buying cd from amazon . i just heard this one and it seems to be a lot better than the one i have heard from the grateful dead . i will give this one a rating of 1 star . i think this is a better version of the
0	i had a very bad experience with this album . the cd wa scratched on my way to the office and i could not get past the first track . the song tremor wa cut off before the first word wa spoken on the cd . i had to throw it out .
0	i think i will have to give this tape a go on my next trip to nashville . i still love the oldie , but i do not like this version of here come the sun , the good life or love is the answer . i guess it is just me , but i do not like the oldie .
1	this is so much more than a good guitar album ! this is a great collection of great song and great playing ! if you like jeff buckley or john mayer this is a must-have for your collection ! jeff buckleys version is better than his older version .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	the beginning is very good . then , just a the song get going , the guitar solo start . it is very boring , and it really take away from the song . the end is great though and i give it a 5 star rating .
1	music make me feel like i am in a movie .
0	i love this song to death and i have been married to my husband for 20 year . he is also a musician , so we listened to the music . he would always be singing this song . i love this song and i love the lyric .
0	i love this song and would play it at any show , but i have never seen it used !
1	i really like the sound and the texture on this song . i like the sound of the bell and the drumming . it is a very nice little composition .
1	this song is amazing ! i love the tracklist and the song ! i can not believe how good it is ! this is the best trance song i have ever heard . really , the only thing i wa disappointed in wa that the song wa cut down too short . i love the rest of this album . i am so happy to have a new favorite trance album i can listen to over and over .
1	i love this album . the only exception i can think of where this one is lacking is the one track where she sings i wan na tell you to someone and the other one where she sings i do not wan na be alone to a lover that is currently being murdered .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	awol nation is a fun , upbeat pop-rock band from the u . my wife play the violin , and her parent play the piano . they wrote a song called the last goodbye that we performed at our wedding . i wa pleasantly surprised to hear the song performed live , but wa still worried that it would be a huge disappointment for my wife and parent . i wa wrong . it wa absolutely stunning . allan bole
1	i love this album ! i love it !
1	this song rock .
0	reo-speedwagon is great .
1	a truly amazing album . the quality of the vocal is exceptional . the lyric are fantastic .
1	the first time i heard this song wa at the radiate concert in dallas . it wa a wonderful combination of folk and traditional song . the cd is very enjoyable a well . i am still waiting for the song , and i hope it come soon . it is an old favorite .
0	very very sad .
0	i like this cd , but it is too short for me . i do not want cd that are only 50 minute long . i want cd that are at least a half an hour long .
0	i just bought this song i hope it becomes a hit .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	this is a great cd . sam ha an amazing voice . i hope he make another cd .
1	i love country ! i love old country . i love the oldie . i like it all .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i love the album , and i own it .
1	this is the beatles second best album . the first is the white album . they have never released a second best album . this album is a lot more popular a well .

0	i am really enjoying this album . i think it is really going to give the country a lot of positive attention .
0	i have no idea how this cd came to be on the internet , but it seems that the cd is not a real recording . it ha a couple of track that sound like they were recorded from a tape deck . the bass drum and snare are very loud and harsh . i did get a very faint noise at the beginning of the song aeroplane which could be the recording of a motor running . also there are some sound that appear to be interference from a radio or television , but they are very faint . i wa really impressed with this cd because i had never heard or seen a tom wait cd in person . it is a very good cd . i do not know if it wa made by a local band , but i doubt it . it wa recorded by a live band at a concert .
1	this is one of ohearns most amazing song . the song ha a great groove , the beat of the song is great , and the lyric are great . the only problem is that the song doe not really start to come in until it is almost 2 minute of the song , which is way too much time . i guess it is because of the tempo , but i am not sure .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i don ’ t like her music ; i think she is too ugly .
1	i am so happy to have found this site . it is the best site for buying and selling used music . i wa looking for a used dave clark five cd , but i could not find it . i looked for a while , but nothing wa available .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i liked the first album but am now beginning to hear some of the flaw in this album . i like it . i think this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
0	really bad cd . i like my cd to last a long time . i will not buy another album under these circumstance .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i liked this one the best
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	this is a fantastic compilation of recording of music by american composer ernest ansermet . the music is fantastic and the compilation of the recording is excellent . i would highly recommend this to anyone who love ansermet or classical music in general . although i would not buy it for myself , i would recommend it to others .
1	this cd is very good . i have been listening to this cd for about a year now and i am glad i bought it .
1	she is a very talented singer and songwriter . the beat are very good and the song is very nice . the lyric are very nice . i like the version of this song done by the original artist and they are very good . the beat and lyric of this song are very nice . i have a version of one artist and they are very good . the beat is very good and this song is very nice . i like this song better . i have a version of someone and they are very good and the beat is very good . this song is very nice . i have a version of someone and they are good . this song is very nice .
0	i will be honest with you , i wa not a huge fan of whitney houston . i mean , i like her music , i even like her video . i just could never get past the whitney houston i will always love you and i have nothing song .
1	i would like to know more about her , but the song sound good , and i like her voice
0	it might be too fast for her style , but it is a good song .
1	i loved this cd . it is a great dance party album . i love the name dancing in the dark . i thought it wa a great name , but the song dancing in the dark is just awesome . i know that the cd is called dancing in the dark , but it is about a little kid who is dancing in the dark . so you have to be a little kid to listen to this cd . i recommend this cd to everyone because of the song dancing in the dark .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	i like the album alot .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i like the window phone 8 a lot , and am glad that microsoft is finally letting the full keyboard work .
0	i like the song , but it is a bit cheesy
1	love you so wa the one song that wa on my to be added to my cd . so i purchased the cd with that song on it . i have been waiting for the next one !
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i think this is a great song ! the lyric are a wonderful way to communicate your love for god and to show your love and devotion to him . the music is beautiful .
1	great song . i have heard it before , but it is new to me , so it is a refreshing change . i love it .
0	i love this song . the lyric and harmony are very good . the music is also lovely . i do not know why i do not like this song .
1	this is one of the best trance album that i have ever heard . it ha it all . you can expect a lot of variety , but this album will definitely keep you dancing and making you wonder . i am not sure why everyone is praising this album so much , but i have to agree . i have been listening to this for the past 4 day , and i am still amazed at this album . the music is very good , and it ha a nice variety to it . i like that the album is very long . the last few track are amazing . not to many artist are left out . i had to listen to this album over and over again in order to be able to hear every single song . i am very impressed with this album . it is worth the money that you paid for it . i would recommend this album to anyone who like to dance and listen to great trance music .
1	this is a good compilation of song from the 80 , although a lot of them are from obscure 80 band and i wa expecting more originality . the song on the tape are all over the place , from the heavy , to the pretty , to the funky , to the ballad . it is very hard to find a tape of the 80 without at least one or two song by the smashing pumpkin . there is also a song by the band called the end , which is a complete waste of time . some of the song are quite good , and the tape ha a few decent surprise on it . there is a lot of music that is very hard to find , so i suggest you check this tape out if you want to hear something different . there are also some song that really are just not worth listening to .
1	i like the cd . i bought it so i could listen to it for the first time . i love it !
1	i like the song all together now and i need a hug .
1	i wa on my way to see the stone when i got this cd in the mail . i had decided to buy the cd at that point in time because i had heard that there would be an interview with the producer of this album , and wa very excited to hear what this album sounded like . i got to the stone concert at the roseland ballroom in new york city , and i wa so excited and proud to see the stone . i had heard that they were really good live , and they were . i could not get enough of their music and thought about buying this album on my way back to the airport . i wa so excited to hear this album , and wa very happy with the stone playing . i am so glad i got this cd . it is fantastic and a very good album .
0	i love the way he sings in different style , but it is really a shame that he doe not do it more . i love the way he writes , but i wish he would do more of it . the album is a winner .
0	i love bruno mar album but i do not like this song when i listen to it .
0	i just went on amazon to buy this album and saw review for a best of of this album . i have listened to this album and liked most of the song . it is by far the best album i have ever bought . i would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates john mayer or jeff buckley .
1	the lyric to this song are god bless u all . i agree with that .
0	this is an album that need to be heard . the song are all great , and you can not help but sing along to them .
0	i am not sure why i have this cd , i just know i do . the song is catchy , but the video is terrible , it is just bad .
0	the album is good , and i do like a few of the song . i hate what happened to the band , but i still like the music . if you are looking for a real album , i would suggest live at the opera house . it is actually great .
1	i liked it . i liked that the band got together again ( it wa a long time ago ) . i enjoyed it very much . i liked the way the song are put together . the band make a unique sound . i liked the way the song were put together with the different instrumentation . i liked the way i feel free wa sung . the song walking on a wire wa very good . i would have liked to hear more of the instrumentals . i do not like the song the end of the world . i would have liked to hear more of the instrumentals . the song the end of the world wa very loud . i liked the song the end of the world . i liked the song the end of the world , very good song . i liked the song walking on a wire , very nice song . i liked the song i feel free . i would have liked to hear more of the instrumentals .
0	this wa one of the first album i ever bought . i feel like i am missing out on some great music .
0	it is one of my favorite song of all time . i do not really know what to say . i just liked it .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i do not like her music . i do like her voice . it is not her best voice , but it is her most unique voice .
0	good cd , but the lyric on this cd are not what i expected .
1	this is my first hammond album . i love this album so much . i have always been a hammond fan since i wa a child , so i wa excited to buy this album and i am glad i did . i love this album . i love the song on this album .
0	barbra wa the best singer i have ever heard .
0	this song suck , but it might make you laugh .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i use the laptop everyday to write and draw and i love my window phone
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	my husband and i love this song . it is a nice change of pace .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i love both of these recording . i love the way she sings .
1	this is a great song . i really like it . the guitar solo is very nice and it ha that amazing beat that i like so much .
1	i love this song ! it make me happy .
1	i bought the music album for my son . the song that he requested is called goodbye by the band the beatles . i wa pleased with the song a it wa on the album . the vocal are very catchy and fun to sing along to . it is definitely a good song to listen to during the holiday .
0	tom scott is one of my very favorite producer . he is always a pleasure to listen to . his music is always fun and his lyric are always interesting . i am a tom scott fan a well , but i would not hesitate to recommend this album to any tom scott fan who like fun , upbeat pop .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	i agree , it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is just a shame , the lyric are so boring .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this is a bunch of annoying singer , this cd need to be deleted from your library . i do not have time to listen to other cd and this is just not worth it to me .
0	i have never heard an album with such a strong collection of song a this . the song are all very good .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this is the third cd i have purchased from amazon . i am a fan of the dave clark five . the first two cd , i purchased because i love the music and the first two cd , i purchased because i love the band . i am a fan of their music . i like their music . i like their song . i like their sound . i like their music . i like their music . i like their music . they are my favorite group , but this cd is awful .

1	this song make me feel like a better person . i really enjoy it . i would like to get the video of her in the song . i do not know what i would do with this song if i could get a video of her in the song .
0	i have read that keith is a very good singer . i bought this cd . i am very happy that i bought this cd . it is one of my favorite cd . it is very nice . i like most of the song on it . i love the music . it is very nice . they are all very nice . i do not like the song that are played over and over again . i just do not like that at all . i just do not like that at all . they have nice song . i like that . the only thing i can not stand is the song that are played over and over again . that is all i can say about that . it is better if they are played on the radio . i can not stand that . it is better if they are played on the radio .

0	the cd is awesome . it ha some good song , some not a good . but that is about it . i have already sold it and bought two more of your cd . please do not take any credit for this . i can hear the song now . one of your song ha a cool background noise effect . i have never heard of that . the album is about 30 minute long and it ha six song on it . the first three are good . the last three are not so good . the song are all from the bible . the song are all biblical . the song have a slow tempo . the song are from a bible book . i found it funny that the not so good song are from the bible . the song are all about the bible . it ha a good sound and it is the kind of cd you can listen to over and over . it is a cd that you can listen to for hour .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .

0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	to the point . very well played , with no filler . interesting and well played , but not interesting .
1	this song and the album are fabulous !
0	this song really hit home with me . i have loved my husband for a long a i can remember , but he ha always been a man of his word . he would always bring me flower and show me how much he loved me . i would be sitting in my chair and he would leave the room . one evening , i found him passed out on the kitchen floor . i thought he had taken the medicine i had left on the kitchen table for him . when i called for him , he would not answer me and continued to sleep . i went to bed and cried for several hour . i woke up the next morning and realized i wa pregnant . i am now a mother of two wonderful child . i would like to say thank you to all the people who helped me through this tough time . i would also like to thank my husband for being a wonderful husband . i hope this song can help to make my life a little bit better .

0	i liked the song but she is too old to be writing song and not singing them .
1	i think this song is a great song and a good example of what a real female perspective is . it is a real woman song . it is a woman song for a woman . it could be a real woman song for a woman . it is a real female perspective .

1	dave & steve clark are a band that come from a small town called dacula in georgia in the south . they were discovered by a man named don wa who wa a big fan of the band . wa is a great man and his only regret is that he never got to meet dave clark . he wa the one that discovered the dave clark five . he is one of most important recording artist in history just like the beatles and the stone to name a few .

1	a good song .
1	i never thought i would like the supremes , but i do . i am a fan of the supremes , just not this particular group . the melody is so beautiful and the lyric are so romantic . the supremes are so much more than just a group of singer . this song is a great song . i love it so much . i am glad that the supremes are the one that wrote it . i love them .
1	this is by far the best trance release i have ever heard . i have never been so impressed with trance music . it is very good and very well produced .
1	i love to sing this song . it make me feel very positive .

1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	this is not a good album at all . it is not the sound , but the fact that it is from the 50 . that is all it is good for . i have listened to a few other album from the 50 and even those are worse . this album is not worth the money , imo . i am sorry that i lost $ 150.00 . i would like to give it one star so i can complain more about it . this album is not worth the money , imo .
1	i bought this single for my daughter . i also bought the album . i think i will buy the cd .
0	the music wa perfect . but the lyric were awkward . they really did not have any place in the movie .
0	i really liked you can not hurry love by the dave clark five . i thought it had a special feel . this song is so bad it make me want to throw up . it is just a mess . i do not know why it is on the top 100. i do not know why i am listening to this song , but i can not stop .

1	i really like the song . i wa listening to it and the song reminded me of a great song from a country artist .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i have been listening to this cd for a few day now and i must say i am surprised by the quality and quantity of the song . at first i thought it wa a one time thing , but now i am beginning to wonder if there will be another cd just like it . i have a feeling it is going to be a real hit . for the first time in my life i am listening to a cd that is so good you can not stop .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i love the whole album , but can not get past the title track . love the sound you can get out of this .

1	i love this song . i love to sing this song at work .
0	she sings pretty good .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	my brother is a huge katy perry fan , and i have to say , this song is one of the most beautiful , powerful and moving song i have heard this year . i think people should buy the cd , just to hear it all over again .
0	love the lyric , love the music , love the overall quality of this album , love the packaging but the cd drive doe not seem to hold up that well , i think the cd drive for the cd is flimsy .
0	no love for this singer . his voice is flat and he sings like a girl . i will not rate this a 4 or 5. it is good enough to listen to . i can not see the appeal .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	i just bought the beautiful life cd . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	this is another great album which is really hard to describe . to me , it is a mixture of different style and genre , and it is very diverse . so much so that i wa not sure what to say about it . even though i really liked it , i am just not convinced that they should have released it a a 2-disc set .
1	jp is one of my favorite guitarist and his music is very unique .
1	i bought this song to practice for singing in a country karaoke competition . my daughter and i sang it at our family christmas eve gathering and it wa a hit .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	this album wa not worth getting . it is terrible .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	this is a very simple song , but it brings out the best in me . i love the chorus , and the ending , but i still think the bridge is a little too far away from the chorus .
0	this cd is good . i like this cd . i like this cd . this cd is good . i like this cd . i like this cd .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this is the longest song on the tape . i wish it wa longer . i like the dave clark five too . i think this is the second best song . i do not care much for the cover of this song , but , i do not dislike it . i do not know what the two song that are on here are . i do not know if i like or dislike them . the two song i do not know are the one that got away and the long and winding road
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	you want a great christian album ? try this . great band and song . lyric are not always to be trusted . but the melody is so beautiful that it not so bad . i love that the band is in good company like led zeppelin and led zeppelin . i especially like the harmonica and the rhythm guitar . i have to confess- my favorite song is i am so happy . i wa totally moved by that one . not to be confused with i am so happy- i am which is the best thing on their live album/dvd .
1	this cd sound great ! i bought it for my six year old son . he love listening to it . this cd sound great ! i bought it for my three year old grandson . he really loved it . i bought it for my two year old grandson . he really loved it . i bought it for my three year old granddaughter . she really loved it . this is a great cd to have with you when walking on the beach and listening to the ocean .
0	great , though i do not have the word to sing along to .
0	i love that this song is so positive . i like the lyric , and i love the music . i listen to the rising when my daughter is at work ( the fall from grace version ) .
0	this cd is very boring . i do not think i will be buying it again
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i love the sound of this album .
0	i think she should have done better with this album , and she did the best she could .
0	one of my favorite christmas album of all time . i have listened to it a lot , and it is always at the top of my car radio rotation . i wish it had been around when my son wa born . i would buy it again , but i wish it had come out a few year ago .
1	i am glad bonnie is back . i am sure she will be remembered .
1	i love how this album ha different song . some of them are very good , and some of them are not that great . some song are very catchy , and others are not so good . i would definitely listen to this a a first date . i am not a fan of pop rock , so i would definitely not listen to this a a first date .
1	this is another one of my favorite , i just listened to it again this morning and i liked it , i would listen to this cd over and over again .
0	i have to say , i had forgotten about this album . it is a bit different than the other i have tried . i wish i had read the review on it before i ordered it , i would have skipped it and gotten one of his earlier recording .
1	i have always loved this song , but never had it on any device . i have loved playing it christmas morning . i can not wait to play it again .
0	this is a good song , but the album is bad !
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i bought this album because i liked the review . i bought it because it wa recommended on amazon . i wa very happy with my purchase .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i enjoyed my first listen to the new jvj album . i have listened to it more than once . the new album is better . i love the new album ! i am going to buy the old one . i am not sure i like the way jvj is playing now . i want to like the new album but i do not . the new album is better . i love jvj . just do not like the new singer .

0	i wa looking for something to help me get through the day . this song wa perfect .
0	i have really enjoyed this album , but only if you are really into trance music . it is not really a trance album , but it is a nice album . it ha a good mix of different genre , but if you are not into trance music and you do not know how to classify this album , i would say pop . i have listened to this album for 10 hour now , and i really enjoy it . the song are well made and the song structure is also very good .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice

0	this song came on and my daughter wa singing along . i asked her if she wa a christian and she said no . i told her that god ha a plan for her and he will bring her through this . it reminded me that god will be with her always and that he will be there for her . it also made me laugh to hear her sing these lyric . to him who love me , who ha helped me , who ha been there for me , who ha been there for me , i can sing on and on through eternity .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .

1	i love tom scott . i have enjoyed his work for many year now . i have had the pleasure of meeting him personally and having him perform with the band on many occasion . he is a wonderful artist .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	there are a few song that i like and a few song that i do not like . i know this album is better because i got the first cd when it came out . i do not like the song praise god . i also do not like the song beautiful and amazing . it is weird that they did not want me to have the first cd when i got the first cd .
0	i like this album . i like the dave clark five . i wish they would have spent more time with the other member of the band . this is not a bad album at all , just average , and it seems like they are trying to recreate the sound of the early 60 . it doe not sound like they are trying to get on with it or do anything different . it just sound like a cover band with guitar , drum , bass , and vocal . i have played this album many time since i purchased it and each time i listen to it i just laugh at the joke of it all . it is not bad , it just is not worth paying $ 20 for , and i will not be buying it on cd when i can get a much better version for free on youtube . i would recommend this album to people who actually enjoy music , but know when to stick to the classic . this is their best album , but i do wish that they would work on the other member of the band . they need to work on their vocal more . but i do not blame them for trying .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	a good , old-fashioned country song by a fine group of friend . i would like to hear more of their music .
1	this song really get me every time . this song ha the perfect word for the situation i am in . it ha a positive and soothing message to it .
1	i really like this band . this is the best album i have ever heard .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i like the song . i think it is a good song . it is not a perfect song , but it is a good one . it is a good song . i like it .
1	this is a pretty good song . it is pretty mellow . the guy on the guitar is really good . he is one of the few people i can listen to for hour on end without getting bored . it is one of the few song i like in this collection . it is so good i can not stand it .
1	this is a compilation of fat waller recording , many of which are new . i wa glad to find this release in the amazon mp3 store .
0	the recording is a bit different from the studio version . it is a bit more upbeat , but still a bit under the direction of the studio band . the vocal are a little more high-pitched , but the guitar part are still excellent , too .
0	i am an old school country fan , but this album is so different it make me want to buy it again .
1	the best trance album of the year so so far , and the first trance album i have ever bought . i would recommend this album to anyone who like trance .
0	this is the best song i have ever heard in my entire life . i really love it .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	i like her singing voice .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i love this cd ! the song is so catchy !
1	a masterpiece ! absolutely amazing .
0	this is the most played song on the radio in the u.s. i buy this cd everytime i hear it , even when i am traveling . i have purchased some other version but this is the only one that really stand out to me . i can not believe it . i have never heard it with an acoustic . i am so happy .
1	i wa able to download it for free on their website . i am happy about that . i wouldve paid more for it had i known it wa free . i am glad i can listen to it without paying anything . it is a good album . i have got the original and the demo . i would like to give the demo a try but i think i will buy it . i have got the original so i will just play it and see how i like it . if i like it i can buy the original a well . i do not understand why it cost so much to download because i would have paid more for it .
0	it is a great song . i do not really like the verse , but it is great to sing along with any time when i want to feel uplifted . i have not heard the song in 10 year , but i know it is still in my heart .

1	i bought a cd because it is a country album .
1	i like bonnie . i love this album . i like the song on it and i like the way she sings . i like that she put her heart into the song .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i really enjoyed his song .
0	this is an excellent song . the only downside is that the chorus is a little repetitive .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	this album is good but r. kelly voice is not a great a on the other album . at least that is what i think .
1	this is the best of dave clark five . the song are good and the band is tight . all song are good . the best part is that they are all from different album . i am glad i bought this cd , but wish i had bought all of the dave clark five album .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i like it and the song ( mp3 download of i like that ) , with decent sound quality a well . i have heard this song many time before - and i do not think it is corny . this song is a bit out of place on the album , but it doe not detract from the album a a whole .
1	i love it when i can find a song that reminds me of a particular moment in my life . this is one of those song . i love it !
1	i bought this album because i am a fan of the clash and i wa disappointed to see it wa a cover album . the album cover doe not sell it and the music doe not sell it either , but i bought it anyway . i have enjoyed listening to this album . it is a good mix of rock , and blue with some reggae and punk thrown in for good measure . the sound is great with very good production . it ha a good message . i have always thought that the band were one of the best in the industry and i am glad that i finally listened to their music . i am very excited to listen to their new album . i can not wait to buy it .
0	this is one of my favorite song and i like the lyric . i like the guitar sound in the song .
0	this is the best jon lord album since the road to ruin , the only problem is that he ha recorded a couple of other album that are quite good . still , i have been very lucky to hear this album , and i will continue to enjoy it , because it is not a one hit wonder like most of the other jon lord album i have heard .
0	i guess i will just have to wait for the dvd to come out . i just wish it were here in the state . it would have been better if they had a dvd here in the state .
1	i am impressed with the quality of her voice . her song are very strong and her lyric are very good .
0	i would have to say i have never heard a more boring , clichéd , and uninteresting album . the only thing that come to mind is the one time the beatles played at a small club in my hometown of syracuse , new york . i had seen them a few time , but i had to be there to see them because the club wa only open on monday night . when i got there , they were already at work on their second album . the place wa not nearly a crowded a it wa the night before , so there wa a feeling of being in a church . i wa in the back and did not see who wa sitting in front of me . i also did not see the band member a they arrived . i got to the front of the stage and saw them playing . there wasnt a single person in the audience . when they finished their playing , i turned around and saw a line of people waiting to get into the club . when i tried to get in , there were no vacancy . i went back to my seat and left at the end of the night . i wa just so bored and did not have anything to do . i wa just a kid at the time . i am now 40 year old and have never bought anything from this band . i have been an avid fan of music for a long a i can remember . i bought their first album at the age of 14 and have been a fan of them ever since . it is a shame that these guy are not more famous or appreciated . i have a cd that i have purchased that is by them , and i did not even know it wa from them . i just bought it because it wa on sale . i would really like to have a copy of their first album , but i have not been able to find it . i do not even know how to get that information out to a music store . i just wish they were more popular and knew that they had a big fan base . i have seen them live a few time , but i have never seen them play a record in it is entirety . i would think they would have a new cd out every year , or at least every two year .
1	i love the music . it help me to relax and get into a good mood . it is simple and great to listen to in the car . i will definitely purchase this cd .
1	the dave clark five were one of the first band to create a live rock band sound , and there is still a lot of it to be mined in the 50s-60s . the guy are a great live draw and they recorded many great song . this is one of my favorite from the era . the band wa a bit more polished and le loose , they still have that live rock sound . this is the best version of the song i have ever heard . i would listen to every version of this song over and over again . it is so infectious . i would buy this cd , i would want to own every one i could get my hand on .
1	i thought this album wa fantastic , but then i wa listening to the album on repeat for the past six hour or so . the only thing that i really enjoy is i am the one and i am the one . i have a lot of album that are like this , but this one is very special to me .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .

1	this is a very nice compilation . jazz vocal and piano are well balanced . the song are easy to listen to and are very well arranged .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i have never liked rap music , but i like this cd and i think it is great . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	i liked this cd , but i wa hoping that the artist would put out more music like this . instead , they have gone on to put out one of the weakest cd ever .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this album rock ! this is a great album to listen to . it is so much fun to listen to , it make you feel like you are in a rock music concert . i like the fact that it ha a lot of different type of rock and pop song . i like the fact that it is a lot of different type of music . i like that the song are a lot longer than most album . i like it because of the variety of different style of music . it is a great album . it is a great album ! i like it a lot .

1	this song wa the first time i ever heard mr. varney sing live , and the way he sang on this song made me happy to be alive . it also made me realize how much i missed him a a singer . i have been listening to his album for the last two year , and i still have the cd from those record . the lyric are just a much an expression of his voice , and his passion for the music a they are of his love for his wife , who he say is the best thing he ha ever done in his life .
0	this song sounded like it wa a cover . i do not pay attention to cover .

1	very good song . it ha a great groove .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i love her album but i just do not like the new stuff .
0	the man who sings this stuff sound like he is in his 70 . he is only 26. so , yeah , this is not a terrible album , but for the price , i would have preferred to get a lesser one .

0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !

1	this album is the closest i have come to a jukebox for many year . that is to say , i like one song and it is the one that i replay over and over again . there is also an interesting story behind this particular album . in the 60 and 70 , i wa a member of a gospel band called the goodman . they had several album , most notably just a little love . although the song gone to earth wa on that album , i wa really proud of the song my soul . i did not think it would get any airplay , but it did . then , i wa offered a part in a tv show called the crossroad . i accepted and sang a number of song for that show . the show wa a success , and we had a great time doing it . i wa asked to go out and record a gospel duet with one of the singer from that tv show . i told producer jimmy braly , i will do it but i will not record with someone who may not agree with me . he said , all right , just sing a duet with a guy who is more my style . so i did . my soul went great , and then i had a second request from the show to sing a duet with a singer who wa a little more conservative . i said that i would , and in exchange i wa asked to record aint no way . i have always had a love for the blue , and so i agreed . the song can not take my eye off you wa written by a lady named dorothy moore , who wa a member of the band the staple singer . this woman had a beautiful soprano voice , and she had a great voice . i am happy to say that this is not a duet , but i am happy that this song got some airplay . i believe that this is one of the best gospel song ever written . this song is a tribute to a lady named dorothy moore , who wa a member of the staple singer . she wa one of the great gospel singer of all time . when i wa asked to record this song , i wa not only happy to do it , but i wa also happy that it got some airplay .

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .

1	i am not a huge beatles fan , but i do not know what song she is talking about . it is a good song and it is different from the other song on the cd . i do not know what song she is talking about , but it is interesting , and i like it . i would like to hear what song she is talking about , so i can tell if this is a hit .

0	this song is fun and catchy . i like the music video .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	this album ha a pretty weird cover , i think because the album is live . but i have heard the album before and so i knew that it wa going to be good . i bought this album on a whim and wa somewhat disappointed when it wasnt the live album i thought i wa going to buy .
1	this is a really cool song . i do not know why , but i always remember this song . i think it is by michael jackson . i think the music video is by madonna . very cool .
0	i like this song . i like the fact that the band still play this song in the present . it is great .
0	i liked the first album , but not this , not even the second one . i think this one is better . it is a great album . i would like to see a compilation of old and new stuff like this one .
0	this song is great . i wa on a trip with my family and my son asked to put them on . not only did they like it , but they actually played it in the car before we came home . they played this in the car on the way home . i thought they were going to play it in the house because it wa the only song they played and they did not stop playing it . they are a great family , and they played the cd before we came home . this cd is really good . it is a lot different from the first one .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	this is a beautiful piece of music . i love the melody and the chord . i hope the rest of the album is just a beautiful .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	i loved the performance .
1	i like the lyric to my hero journey and my hero . i like your music . you are a very talented artist . i hope to see you in concert . hope to see you soon .
0	this is not a good cd . it had more crap song then i wanted . there is a song called the heart of prince that is a lot of crap . i do not like prince so i do not want to listen to this cd . i think this cd is a waste of money , but i wa willing to give it a try . the song are good . it is disappointing that this wa a part of a series that is supposed to help promote her book instead of promoting her cd . i thought the song were good . i think she would have done better on a studio recording . i would have bought this if it wa on sale for $ 0.00 .
0	i am glad the singer is marie but it sound like she is from a bygone era .
0	i like the cd , but it is for everyone
0	on the positive side , i like all of the song in this cd . on the negative side , the cd ha major problem . first , there is a lot of noise in the beginning . second , the cd is damaged . i had to return it to amazon .
0	i wa surprised by how much i love this version . i am not a huge fan of this version .
1	this is a collection of recording of the music and the brain , which wa made by the musicologist alan lomax in the 1920s . it is important to note that lomax wa a very successful musician who composed a lot of piece and that he wa highly regarded a a composer . i am not sure that lomax wa the best recorder for doing his recording , but he wa a very good musician . when he did his recording he used a primitive record and player called a cylinder . he used very little reverb and very little dynamic range , which resulted in a good sound . he used a very primitive audio amplifier to amplify the record and he used a very primitive tape recorder , which recorded to a very small capacity tape . lomax had a very poor grasp of sound engineering . he did not have a sound engineer , but he did have a sound engineer for his music . for the recording of the music and the brain he used the best recording technology available at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder . he used a very primitive tape recorder , which wa very primitive and very primitive recording technology . he did not know that the way to get more sound wa to use the best recording technology at the time , which wa the mimeograph and the cylinder , but he did use these technology to make his recording . the recording are not very good because he used the best recording technology available at the time . the recording are very interesting because they are not very good because of the poor recording technology used by lomax . lomax had great respect for his work and he used to say that he wished that he had a recorder that recorded to the best tape technology at the time . lomax wa very much a man of his time , and he used the best technology available during the time that he recorded his work . he did not have the best technology available at the time , but he did have the best technology available at the time .
1	i love it ! it is different and it is all over the place . i recommend it to everyone .
1	i received a cd and a copy of my cd from amazon . i wa so excited when i got the cd and i love it ! i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard this on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio i could not believe it . i also received a copy of my cd and i loved it . it is amazing . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard my song play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the radio earlier today i could not believe it . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if they will ever be released . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if i will ever hear them . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard me cd play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on the channel i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never played me cd on the radio . i do have a few other cd but i am not sure if those will ever be released . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard them cd play on the radio . so when i saw it come up on radio earlier today i wa very excited .

0	the first part is ok and then it get into a very good groove . i think it is a good song .
0	i ordered this cd and i could not find the song on the website , but i found it on my phone , i tried to download it , but i could not , it would pause and start over every time i tried , and the song stopped after a few minute . i do not know why this album is worth buying , it is a waste of my money .
1	i love this song . it is great .
1	this song ha been on all the time . it is the first song i ever learned in elementary school . i had the lyric memorized for the first song , but forgot the second . that is the way i am . the lyric are so cool . i love this song and i am really impressed with the quality of the production .
0	i am really confused . i do not know what i am doing here . this music is not my type of music . the songwriting is average .
0	i am a longtime bonnie raitt fan . i wa very disappointed when i received my copy of the album in the mail . the song order wa incorrect and the cd had been previously played .
1	i like the cd and the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about it . very nice sound .
0	i do not know where to start with this . this album reminds me of the smashing pumpkin . i like some of the song , but i do not really know why this album ha been on amazon for so long .

1	this is the most beautiful christmas album i have heard in a long time . it is so beautiful and tender and yet so full of life . this is a truly beautiful album .
1	this is a great song to sing when you are angry with god . however , i would also recommend this song to those who need a song to remember god love .
1	i am a big fan of the last two l7 record . i think this is a great album overall . i do not like a little too late , but i like several of the other song . i do not like the album cover . most of the cover photo are very lame . i have a hard time imagining the band in this album .
1	i just bought this album for my brother and sister . i love their music .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	no , it is not the same song . it is a great version , this one , in which the song is performed with a live band , and the band is very good , and the song is very good , and they sound great .
0	very good ! the instrumentation is great and the lyric are not too long . the music is very catchy .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	it is a mediocre song , and it will sound like it to anyone who ha ever heard it . it is mediocre . it is boring . it is just plain old mediocre . it is bad .
0	i like it a lot . i like the movie version way better .
1	i have been listening to this song for quite a while , and i can honestly say that i have never heard it before , but i sure like it .
1	i love this cd and i will be getting a second one a soon a i can , i already purchased an album and i love it , very easy to listen to and it is great !
0	this is a great album , it ha some great track like boom boom ( intro ) and time of your life that have been in my ipod for age and a few of the other song that are good but kind of forgettable .
0	i love the cd , i just do not enjoy the video that it came with .
1	one of her best album !
1	i love hey jude .
0	this is just an average album and i would not recommend it .
0	i love this cd . i can not get enough of this . i play it all the time . i love the harmony of the song . i have a love/hate relationship with christmas music . this is a great collection of christmas music arranged and produced by peter allen with the vocal by marie osmond .
0	my husband and i have the same problem with this cd . it is a complete waste of time .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i can not figure out if i like this song or not . the video is great .
0	this is not a very good song . the song wa good until the 2nd verse . after that , it became really bad . on the last 3 verse , it is just not a good song . the guitar playing is good , but the lyric are too repetitive . the guitar playing just doe not match the song . and the lyric just do not flow . it is not too bad , but it is not a good song either .
1	i am looking for a country cd to buy , i like it alot , i think i will buy more
1	i listened to this album many time this week , and i am glad i did . i love the song . i love song that have multiple verse and different harmony . most of the song are very good , and the chorus is one of the best chorus ive heard in a long time .
0	this is not a very good live album . i would not buy it again , or recommend it to anyone . the best song from the first two or three are the one from the first two or three . the rest of it is boring . the band is good . the recording is horrible . i would not buy it again .
0	i saw the band a soon a i got home from work . i live in a small town and i know most people here . the band played to them , but i would prefer to have more band that are local .
1	this album is excellent , and a a fan of the beatles i could not resist getting this album . i can not wait until their next album come out !
1	i bought it expecting it to be a compilation of several song , but
1	this song is really nice . it is a very well written song . the video is really cute a well . i like it a lot .
1	this is a great album for christian , but not necessarily religious . i think that the message is important , but i do not agree with the reviewer that the message is not effective . i love the song on this album , and they are all very powerful . one track that ha really had an effect on me is praise god , the song that the reviewer mentioned . it is a very powerful song , and one that i have had a very great effect on me . i love the message and the song . i think that the reviewer is wrong , and i do not think that her comment is fair . the song just say praise god , and that is all it say . i love that she sings the song praise god because of the word that she sings . she sings the word into my heart . she sings the word that i need to hear . she sings the word that i need to believe , that i need to hear . i have listened to many christian music album , but this may be the only one that i will ever listen to .
1	i like her music . i have liked some of her song . she is a wonderful singer .

0	i like this song , but the vocal are poor . the vocal have been improved , but the song doe not stand out any longer .
0	this is the first song that i learned how to play on the piano . i have tried to learn the other song on this album but i have never really gotten very far . they are very easy to learn . but this song is one that i can not seem to get started on . it just doe not seem like a song that i like at all . i just can not seem to get it . i have tried to learn it but i have never really gotten very far . i am not even sure why it is taking me so long to learn it .
0	this song really doe not do much for me , but i love lorde . she is great .
1	awol nation is a good song .
0	this album is excellent and i have heard it a number of time . it ha a good sound and the vocal are average .
1	i hear this song all the time . i like this song .
0	i am looking for a new album , of course , this is not the album i wa looking for . this is a nice album , and i would like to listen to it again and again . however , i do not want to listen to a commercial album . i am very disappointed in this album .
1	i like this song a lot . it is a nice song , and i like the lyric .
1	i had my jaw on the floor listening to this . the song where the love go is one of my all time favorite . the song tequila sunrise is also a classic .
0	i am not a huge fan of the bass , but the rest of the band is amazing . i love the fact that they have two drummer , one of whom is a woman .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	great album . i think it just need a little more songwriting and performance in the song i did not like , but other than that , a great album .

0	i have never been a fan of country music . i grew up listening to western music . but i have to say , this cd is a great example of what i grew up with . it is probably the best of them all . i bought the cd on a whim . i had never heard her before and i wa curious to hear her music . i wa really impressed with her writing . the song i am a country girl is the best example of her writing . i have to say , she is a very talented person . i would love to have her write for me . i would love to have her write and perform my music . it is just that i have to pay her to do that . i would love to be able to listen to her music and just be a fan of it . i will admit that i know i will be the one to sell it , because i am a fan of her music . it is just that i have to pay her to do it . i have to admit that i know that i will have to sell it . i do not think that this is what country music is all about . i do not think i have to pay someone to play it for me . i do not think that i have to pay someone to play it for me . i dont think that this is what this music is all about . i do not think i have to pay to play it for me . i do not think i have to pay to play it for someone . i do not think that this is what this music is all about . i dont think i have to pay to play it for me . i dont think i have to pay to play it .

1	a very good rock album . i like it very much .
1	this song is a very nice version of the song . i do not see how this version is a better version than the original , but i would recommend it to everyone .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i do not consider this song to be a good song . i find the lyric to be really bad , and the song to be just a really bad song . the beat is awful , the instrumentation is horrible , and the singing is horrible .

0	i got this cd in a mail-order catalog from amazon . i have to say that there are some great song on here , but i would have loved to have the cd in a jewel case .

1	she is a great singer . she ha a nice voice . i like the song .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	great album ! this is what an album should be like . i wish i had known about this album when i first started listening to trance music .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	this is another one of karajans greatest recording . this one is called the world is waiting for the sunrise . it is a very emotional song . the piano is beautifully played by karajan . the violin is beautiful and the violin solo is beautiful . this is a very good recording of a very sad song . it is a very good recording of a very emotional song .
0	i have not listened yet to the cd , i would not recommend this .
0	this show is a good show with a good host . the show is generally informative and entertaining . i would listen to this show again .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	have listened
0	i found this cd to be a little bit disappointing . i wasnt a fan of the songwriting , but the song were pretty decent . i can not say i like the songwriting a much a i liked his previous work .
0	for me , this is the best sam sparro album of his career . the crazy love cover is more of a tribute to the song namesake and sparro , but this cover ha a lot more energy than the original , and the song melody is a lot more interesting . the lyric are just a good , but the vocal are a little rough and the arrangement are a little dated .
1	i really like this album . i am a big fan of bonnie . i like that she ha put a lot of herself into the song . i like the song and i like the way she sings . i also like the lyric .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i am not sure i understand the point of this album so far . it definitely is not terrible , but it is not spectacular either . the guitar sound a bit thin and the vocal on the first few song are not very memorable . i still do not know what the point of the album is , but i will probably listen to the next one .
0	the cd contains some great song and the cover art is nice .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	not his most favorite .

1	i have bought a lot of cd over the year and have never been disappointed . i have never been disappointed with this cd . the music sound good and it is very relaxing .
1	this is the only song in the entire soundtrack of the movie the godfather that i find really , really annoying . however , if you are willing to overlook it annoyingness , you will find this track a wonderful addition to the soundtrack !
1	this is a very nice version of a traditional . i love it !
0	i wa surprised when i started this cd at first , but after i started listening to it with my boyfriend i wa glad i wa patient and downloaded it . i am very happy that i have found this cd .
1	this song is a must have for christmas . i love this song . i bought it for my husband . he is an osmond fan . he wa thrilled with the song .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	this is not very good , but it is a good song .
1	this is great ! i just finished listening to it and it is a great song . i would like to know what song she is talking about , so i can tell if this is going
0	lost being
0	this song is one that i got on the first day of my membership , and i have never gotten out to listen to anything on there until i got that song . i like it . i think it is a good song , just not a very good song . the beat is good , but the verse and chorus are a little disappointing . i feel like it could be a lot better . it is a good song , just not a great song . i think it is a good song , but it is a bit unoriginal . if you like gnaw then you will like this . if you like gnaw then you will like black and gold . i think this is a good song , but i do not think it is good enough to make the list .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	this song is better than the one on the other album by the dave clark five .
0	my friend really like this song .
0	the best song i like in this cd is the only song i like in this cd . the best part is that it is a cover . i really like the music . i would give it a 4 star rating . the worst part is that they broke the song into part and sold each song separately for $ 14.95 .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	i wa very surprised by this . a good singer and musician . but i do not really think that much of this . i like the cover but there are some thing that are wrong .

1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i think that hasselvander should write his own review because this is his best album . i have listened to this album several time . each time it is a new experience . my favorite track is the last track , last goodbye . but i like everything on this album . i like the feel of the album , the artwork and the production . i think that this album is a great album .
0	good album . i do not know anything about him , but i like that it is not all about sex .
0	this song is a definite winner , especially if you like the beatles , especially the white album . good music and great lyric . i have listened to it so many time i can still hardly believe it took me so long to get around to writing this review . i just want others to know it is a great song .
1	i think the lyric are really good . the music is good . i think it would be a good album to listen to with others and have a good time . it is a great album .

1	this hymn is full of positive energy .
1	i really like this cd , i have been listening to it for a long time . i really like the production . i know it is not the best , but i like it . i think david lee roth is one of the best singer ever . and i think he is one of the most powerful voice . it is his voice , so he should be able to sing like that . the lyric is one of the best , and they are always thought provoking .
0	if you are a fan of bruno mar , this one for you .

0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i wasnt expecting this album , especially by my standard . maybe i should have listened to i still believe a little bit more . i like the song , but the album is uninteresting .
0	this cd is good , but the sound quality is not very good . it sound better than the cd the red barn by the old 97s , but not a good a fool for love by alanis morissette .
0	this is one of the top album of the 90 .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !

1	a very good old blues-rock record . a really great blue rock album .
1	this is a great song .
1	this is what i call a tom wait cd . i did not know what to expect with this cd . i like tom wait because he is very creative and he is very creative with his record . this is a tom wait cd and i am happy with it . i think it is a fun and good-sounding album . it ha a lot of energy and it is an enjoyable listen . it is not an exciting listen but it is well written . it is easy to enjoy and it is a decent listen . i will continue to purchase tom wait cd because i like tom wait . i
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love this album ! it is a good album !
1	it is a really good song .
0	this cd is a must have for any blue lover . you will not be disappointed with this cd .
0	i love this song because it is a sweet love song , but what get my attention is the fact that the lyric and melody are done by someone who is not a female , but a man . i think this is great , and i hope it get played on the radio .
1	i have yet to find a version of this song i like more than the one on the cd , a i have found other song on the cd to be very annoying and distracting . this version is also my favorite .

0	i have been singing and playing guitar since i wa a kid . i have been in a number of band and have performed with many band . this is another one of these song that will go without saying that it is not worth the effort to sing to . it is just painful to listen to . hasselvander doe an excellent job , but i do not see how you can sing this .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	i love this song
0	i love all of this music . if only there wa a way to buy all of it . i think it would sell out quickly .
1	the only reason i bought this is because the cd is not in a box ( or the cover is not printed in the box ) but it is on a cd .
1	sam sparro is a great jazz musician . this album is not only a great jazz album but it is also a great jazz album . i would rate this record an 8.5. i would recommend this to anyone who like jazz .
1	i love this man and this album is one of the best r kelly album in my opinion .
1	this album is just great ! it is my favorite out of the three album i have received so far . i have never heard an album of this quality in jazz i have heard from the like of chick corea and others . the song are a little off key at time , but very enjoyable . i would recommend this album to anyone who ha not had the pleasure of listening to this amazing artist .
1	i have been listening to this song for year . it is like the only piece of music that make me want to drink .

1	i love the album . i think that lareine is a very good singer and she can sing better now . i like the album .
1	just ordered the beautiful life cd . i will be purchasing more of your music .
0	if you enjoy this kind of music there is no such thing a a bad band . check out this band . i am not sure if any of you have ever heard the band , but they are on my favorite band list . the band is called the big lebowski , and they have released 7 album . the 7th album is called the big lebowski ( the new album ) . i have only heard the first album through the cd . i am very much looking forward to hearing the new album . i have heard some of the song on the first album . the song on the first album do not sound a good a the new album . but the band ha just started getting their second album out and it will be out in the new year . so look out for the new album . i really like all of their album so far . the band ha been around since the 90 . they are a very good band . i highly recommend you check out this band .

0	i purchased this product because i really enjoy the song on the album . i enjoy listening to the music . i have several cd of the band i am interested in purchasing . i thought this would be something for me to listen to . i have not heard anything like it yet .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is one of my favorite song . i like this song very much .
0	i have listened to this cd twice and i really like it . i wish i could afford to buy it again , but it is just not worth it . i feel that it is not good enough to recommend it to the public . i have bought a cd from cdbaby that i think is better than this one . i would certainly recommend this cd to any of my friend , but i would not recommend it to anyone else . i have no idea what the quality is like , and i have not personally listened to it .
0	i am a huge fan of the whole the secret series ; i had pre-ordered this one when i saw it at my favorite record shop . i am glad i did because i wa not disappointed . it ha that good music that i love . the secret is not the best album in the series ( there are better album in the same series ) . but it is a great album overall . i have yet to find an album that i like more . there is a reason why i continue to love this music .
1	i am looking for a trance song that is very melodic and is not a much about the dance floor a this one . the song is very well sung and ha a lot of good lyric .
1	this compilation is a great collection of musical recording of the late 1950s . it is an easy to find compilation and is a great compilation . the song are mostly of the late 1950s and the style of music are all great . this compilation is a real treat to listen to . this album ha a real nice feel to it . i like this compilation of late 1950s music . i love this compilation of the music of the late 1950s .

0	i really really like this song . i do not know why i left it out , but i definitely liked the song . i guess what i would change is that sometimes i think you could sing it with an acapella , but sometimes i do not think they would have the same effect . i do not know why i left it out , but it wa enjoyable to me .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .

0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .

1	this is a good self-titled album . it is better than most of the other album out there . i think it is worth the $ 14.95 . if it wa a self-titled cd with a few of the song on the self-titled cd , i would have bought it .
1	this is a very powerful song that you should make a point of listening to on a daily basis . it ha a real message and it will really tug on your heart string . the chorus is one of the best thing in the whole song and the lyric are something god ha put together to pull you to the point of tear . it is a very powerful song and i have only ever heard the song in it original form , so i can not compare it to any other version , but it is definitely the best version of the song i have ever heard .

1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	this band wa the first to come out with a live album . their live album is also an excellent recording . they have a great live show . this album is better than their live album . there are some song that are better on this album , but other song are just a good . this band need to do a more live album , but i do not mind if they make a new album with the song from this one . i mean , there are some song that are better than the song from their live album , but they just do not have a live album . i do not know why they do not just do a live album , since their live album is so good .

0	i want to listen to this album over and over again .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i am a big fan of maria . i love everything about her . i think she should get more recognition . maria ha always been underrated and under-appreciated . she can sing , she ha a beautiful voice and she is talented in all she doe .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	it is a good song , but i think it might have been better a an incidental in the episode . i do not know why they chose this song to be the theme for the show , but it doe not seem to fit in with the rest of the show .
1	this song is so fun ! great chorus and everything .
0	the original version is performed with a live band , but this version is performed a a studio band , and it is not the same song . the sound quality is not the same , and the arrangement is different , and it is different , but it is not the same .

0	i purchased this version of this song a few day ago . the new version is not good . it sound like a cover of the song .
1	this is one of the best trance album i have heard in a long long time . this album is so amazing .
0	my only comment is that some of the song on this album are not available on the radio . for me , this mean song like just a little lovin and let u just dance are not available to me on the radio . other song , like just a little lovin , let u just dance and waltz for mary are very good song .

0	a very nice sounding album .
0	this album could use a bit more variety . the song are good , but i am not sure they are worship song .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .

0	i used to like the dave clark five , but recently i have come to the conclusion that these guy have no talent . this is a lame cover of a great song . i would rather listen to the love of god by the dave clark five . i do not know why they made this cover so bad .
1	this is a wonderful cd . i am not sure if love is the right word , but it is an interesting song .
1	e.s . posthumus is a very hard band to review . i love the music . i love the music . i love the music . but . but i can not review the music !

1	this is great !
1	in my opinion this song is the best song of the 1990s . and with the amazing video i think this song deserves a 9/10 . i think it is really great to hear a man singing about love , and it is even better to hear a man singing in his own voice .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i like this song . it really help me get a good night sleep .

0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	love the song . it is a lot of fun when you can hear an older song written by a younger singer .
1	i have never heard this song on the
1	this is an awesome song . i love it . i have tried to find it on the internet but i could not find it . i searched many web site and it wasnt there . i finally found it on youtube . i have heard it on the radio many time and i loved it .
0	it is got a good beat .
1	i like the song love , but for me the song all alone is the best . i do not know why , but i love this song .
0	i do not know why i bought this album , but i did .
1	this album is a christmas favorite of mine . the album is filled with great christian christmas music . the song on this album are the best christian christmas song you will ever hear . each song on this album is different from the other song on this album . the song jesus , the king is one of the best christian christmas song you will ever hear . i would recommend this album to anyone who like christmas song .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this ha been on of my all time favs . i love it .
0	the pistol annies version is definitely a cleaner version of the song . this is how i enjoy it when i am out and about .
0	i have been a fan of prince since i wa a little kid . however , this is his most commercial album ( not counting the rest of the album ) . i would say if you are not a fan of prince , you should not buy this album .
1	i saw this show at the hollywood palladium and i loved it . the show wa superb and the lead singer wa fabulous ! the chorus wa very good and the female backing singer were excellent . one of the song wa love is the answer , which is a great song . the show overall wa great ! i will definitely be going back to watch this show !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	this is such a beautiful song . i feel like i should be able to sing it .
0	this album is mediocre , boring , and boring . it ha no melody , no chord progression , and a horrible beat . it is just plain old mediocre . it is bad . it is mediocre .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	if i could , i would do this song over a thousand time . the fact that it is an acoustic version make it even better . i love that it is acoustic , the intro is just perfect and the guitar and the backing vocal blend perfectly . i do not like the way the guitar sound too loud , but that is just me . it is not a very heavy song , but it is a slow ballad .
1	this app helped my son get his first word to read . he could read all the way through this book . a must have in every parent bookshelf !
0	i just purchased this album on a whim and i am extremely happy with it . it is a pretty solid live album from a great band . with the exception of heartbreak hotel , the album is very solid and i would say it is a pretty good setlist for a live show , especially for a band like stryper .
1	sweet and simple . this is what i have been looking for in a song on my ipod .
0	wow , this cd is great . i have heard that after the who is live at the roxy album , there are some issue with the sound quality . i bought this cd on the recommendation of an amazon associate , and i am glad i did . i am getting the cd today from amazon and i wa not delighted . the sound quality is good and the cd ha a few good song , but the lyric are not great .
1	i love this album . it ha a very interesting feel . it may not be for everyone , but it is very good .
1	this is a great song . i like the harmony and the way you use the piano . i hope you get the chance to do more music .
0	i am a huge fan of all the song on this cd - this is the only one i have not liked ! i just can not get why anyone would listen to this song .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	i have never liked any of reo speedwagons song . i am sure they are good , but i do not like them . i like most of the other song on their album . walk this way wa the only song i liked .

0	i wa a little disappointed with this album , i wa expecting more from steve morse . i liked the song i would rather be in love with you than dream about you but i wa a little disappointed with the rest of the album . there are a lot of song that i love , but some of the song just do not work for me . i really like the song i would rather be in love with you than dream about you know what i mean ? dream about is a good song , but a little slow .
1	this is a great compilation of some of the best song by this awesome band . the record is very well done . it is just a great collection of song and a great addition to any fan collection .

0	this album is the worst hammond album ever . the sound is very good , but the production is horrible . the worst thing about the album is they used a lot of voice on it .
1	this song is very relaxing and soothing . it is very soothing . i would like to have more word to what i am hearing .
0	reo speedwagon , this is the one i buy the most . but i can not seem to get the cd to play on my ipod . i have it in a case with the other cd . help !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .

0	i had a good time here . i also enjoyed the i am yours video a well . the album is good and the song is good . i enjoyed the last song ( which i did not know wa going to be on the album until i listened to it ) and i thought the song wa very good . i do not think i know the first song on the album , but i am sure i will like it ( and probably buy it ) . i wa disappointed to hear that they used the same song i am yours on the album and the single it is yours on the album . i would have liked to have heard the original song on this album .
0	a fine album .
0	i love the first cd of the big lebowski . it is kind of like a big band version of the door meet the beach boy , that is until the vocal are over . this album is full of great song . i really love the song the ballad of andy kaufman . the other song on the album are also very good . and if you dig the movie , you should check out the soundtrack too . the movie is a great movie and the soundtrack will put you in the right mood for the movie . my favorite song is you are gon na miss it all . i like the way the band play jazz , blue and rock & roll . the band ha also released a couple of other album . the first one is called the big lebowski volume one .
0	the guy who wrote this ha obviously never been to a grateful dead concert .

0	i wa introduced to tommy dorsey and the dorsey brother in the 50 . they were the first recording artist to create record that were more than just a hit or a sell-out . the song were personal , and in a way , the dorsey brother were the first musician to allow u to connect to their music through their word .
0	i really enjoy this guy , he sound good i think he will be bigtime .
1	i bought this album and really enjoyed it . the music is great and there are some very beautiful performance on each track . it is a great addition to any collection .
0	i am not a fan of this song . this is a very average piece of music . the only reason it is on this compilation is that it wa given a 3.5/5 rating by amazon . it doe not do much for me , honestly . the lyric are just not compelling enough to make me want to listen to the song . it doe not inspire me like some of the other song on this compilation have . it is just not a good song period .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	never before have i found a song that so perfectly encompasses the emotion of my teenage year .
1	this wa one of the more powerful and moving song that i have heard all year .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i will try to review this . it is a live recording . the band wa not good . i do not want to review the recording because it is just an mp4 download . it is a live recording of a live concert . so it is not like on the cd . but i will tell you that they will sell a lot of copy . no , that is not a criticism . i am just telling you , do not buy this cd . it is a waste of money . this is a live recording of a live concert . and the cd are not .

1	i really liked this album a it wa very different than the other album that i have listened to . i have listened to a lot of christian music and i have only listened to one other album that i liked and that is a song called my hope by bob marley . i really liked jesus is all i need by joni mitchell . i enjoyed the song on this album .

1	i have been listening to this album of the dave clark five for almost two month now and i can not get it out of my head . there are a few song on this album that i know i could never play , but they are just so good , like the title song , the gilded palace of sin and falling and flying . the song here are truly unique , and each song on this album is a song you just have to listen to . this is not just a good album , this wa an awesome album .
1	this song is a great example of how an acoustic song can be the best one , if it can be sung by a male or female , it will be a hit . that is why i like this song so much . it is a song about a man

0	i really liked this cd , but the only drawback to me is the shipping cost . the shipping cost is very high .

1	this song really make you feel like you are in the movie when you listen to it all by yourself .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

1	i have been searching for some simple , classic rock ballad to listen to lately . i heard these four song and fell in love . they are very different in style and mood , but they have a lot of good point . the first song is an excellent example of a classic rock ballad sung with an acoustic guitar . i found this in many different place , but this version wa the most moving for me .
1	i love this album . it is simply a masterpiece . this is my favorite collection of trance so far . this is not a bad album , but there is not much diversity to the tune or variety to the mix . it is a very good album and i would recommend it to all trance lover .

0	the music is great , but the vocal are boring . this wa not a dis on the vocal of the band , but i would have liked to hear a more energetic group . there were some interesting instrumental passage , but i do not know how many of those were heard because they did not come across strongly enough . while this is a very good recording , the vocal seemed to be drowned out by the music .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

0	i got this album for free on the day the album release so i wa really excited when i found out this album wa a re-release of the original . i really like the re-release of the original album because of the cover art and the fact that they re-released the album after 20 year .
1	it is a great song . i am not really sure what the name of this song is . my son sings it all the time .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i thought the show wa great but that wa it . i have seen the show 3 time and i love it .

0	this song may be good , but it is a little too pop for me . i am not liking the song .
1	i bought this cd because of sam sparros performance on the show .
0	this is an interesting song . i can not really say that i liked this song . i thought i did , but a you can hear i wa wrong . this song is just too fast and too jazzy for my taste . it is not like i can not stand a fast song , but i do not think this song fast . it just doe not flow for me . i am really not a fan of these song that are more of a fast jam than anything . this song is actually a pretty good song , but it is just not my kind of song .
0	the song is average . it is not too bad but not too good either . it ha a great beat and she is a great singer .
1	this album is really good . i like the new song on this album . i like the song , and they sound good . it wa a good album .
1	i have not listened to it all the way through yet , but i like it . i think it is a little bit more mellow that the first 2 song .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i have been listening to this album non-stop since i got it . the song all alone is my favorite on the album . i really like the sound of this album . it is a good listen . i wa impressed with the recording quality . i would listen to it again . it is a keeper .
0	this song is good . it is not like anything i have listened to before .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i love my window phone
1	this is a very good album . it is not the best prince ha ever released , but it is one of the best album prince ha ever released . i have listened to this album many time and still love it . the only thing that make it a little different from most prince album is that i like the beat on this album .
0	i really like jewel singing , but she ha a great voice and the song on this album should have been longer .
1	this is the only tom wait album i have owned since i first heard him . i bought this when i wa about 16. i wa an only child and wa always the last one picked to go to school . i enjoyed the humor of this album . i did not really like it , but it wa my first album ( that i remember at all ) . i had just bought my first car , so i wa about to buy the first car i ever owned . i wa pretty excited . anyway , i loved every minute of it .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	this wa a great cd . the music wa of high quality and the recording were very good . the arrangement of the song are very well done . i bought this on impulse but i am glad that i bought it . it wa well worth the money and i will buy more . i do have to say , when i first listened to the song i realized the cd wa a bit confusing for some of the song , but after a few moment they became much more clear .
0	just wanted to tell you i love your site .
1	i am not a huge fan of these group , but i really like this song and the song is nice when you listen to it with the right attitude . this is the first time i have heard it , but from what i can tell , it sound like a mix between the verve and the crib , which doe not really fit with what i normally listen to , but the singer ha a lovely voice and make it all the more enjoyable . i am not sure how this song is on the cd , but there is not a huge difference between the 2 version of this song , just a few subtle difference .
1	this album is my favorite . this album is my favorite .
1	the album is a mix of rock , punk , and new wave with a little country thrown in . it is my favorite album of all time . a far a new wave , this is not a very popular style but it is good for a classic rock fan like me . the song are good , the album is good . i just wish the music wa on the radio more often .
0	this is the best song on the tape . i like the dave clark five . i do not know if the dave clark five would put out a cd . i really do not know who sang it . i do not know if i like or dislike it . i like the cover of this song , but i do not like it .

1	this set is not just a collection of recording , but it is also an extremely well-done collection of recorded performance . it show that there is a very wide audience for this kind of music , and it is so well-done that we can all enjoy the music . it is a pleasure to listen to this music , and i think that this is one of the best collection of recording of this music that i have ever heard .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )

0	he is back and again he come through with the good . the album is good , but i do not know if it is a masterpiece . it is a good album , but it is not my favorite . he is in a different time and place and i do not know if he is going to stay in that time and place .
0	i have this cd . i really like it , but it is one of those album that you never find another copy of . i think it is kind of sad that it is out of print . i have heard this cd on the radio several time and it is not a good a the cd i have . i am not sure if they will ever hear this one again . this album is kind of like an album of lost track . it is worth a listen , but it is a little disconcerting .
0	i think i have heard better backing track .
1	i love this . i wa never a big fan of sam but after hearing him sing on the show i became a fan . it is really nice to be able to buy a cd and have it delivered to your home .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i have had this cd for two year , and i am still mad at it . i like jewel music and her voice and i wish she would write more song with that voice but unfortunately , she seems to have lost her motivation to continue . it is sad to see her talent go this way .
1	this cd is very different from the other ponder album i have heard . it is very contemporary and upbeat . i really enjoyed it . i would like to see him do the same thing with his other album .

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .

1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	i love the song and i know all of them . i think the one that got away is one of the all-time greatest single by the band . it is a fun , fast , and exciting song to listen to . it is also well-known by many people . the band played the song in the film ace ventura : pet detective . this is a fun song to listen to .
0	i would rather listen to the song they did on the album in control and in control 2 ( which i have ) . i would rather listen to song from the in control album because it ha a little better singing and a little better guitar playing .
0	i bought this cd and i have to say that i agree with the other review . it is very average . i do not think the song are very good .
1	i like johnny cash song , the music is very good , and i like the lyric . it is a good song to listen to .
0	i have been a fan of jp for several year and i have bought all of his album . i also have been listening to his music on my ipod and i have to say that the cd sound very good . the only reason i am going to give it a negative rating is because i found the lyric to be a little strange .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	this is a very good song , but i would not call it a favorite . it is a good song . the lyric are pretty good .
0	it wa a great song and ha great message . i would like to know what the cd is about . it ha a lot of praise music , so i do not know if anyone else ha thought that .
0	i love this song . i have recorded it myself at home . but , i do not know if i should buy it , because the sound quality is really bad . it is just an average song .
1	this song is a ballad . and the vocal are sweet . they sound good . the guitar work is great .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .

0	this cd contains the best song thedave clark five ever recorded in their three-decade career . they were one of the most influential jazz vocal group . they blended a lot of great music and sound with their own unique talentand style . the dave clarkfive were one of the most important jazz vocal group to ever come out ofthe new york city area . they were very versatile , but they were always at their best on theballads and love song . the dave clark five wa the original band that played the song of the era , including several of the biggest hit ofthe era . this cd contains song that are part of the dave clarkfives entire discography . i highly recommend listening to this set to fully understand the dave clarkfive and the legacy of the dave clarkfive .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	i think that this song is really good ! i think it is funny how many people have no problem with the idea of miley cyrus singing a song about a guy and a girl who love each other .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	this album is amazing ! i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of worship song . i would recommend this album to anyone who like praise and worship song . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of contemporary christian music
1	this is very good album . i love it !
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i must say that i am really glad that this album came out . i love the music . i am a big fan of lareine and i can not wait for the next album .
1	great compilation of older ohearn song .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i wish they did not use the video a a backdrop for the song .
1	this song is a little on the simple side , but it is catchy and fun to dance to . it is a great song for any occasion .
1	great album ! the first two song are excellent . the vocal are good but the sound of the instrument is not a good a the first two song . i like the first song but do not care for the
1	this cd is amazing ! i love the sound quality and i love the lyric . the only thing that i find lacking on this cd is that it is sometimes a little hard to listen to , but i will get used to it .
1	i really like the instrumentation . i also like that there are a few guitar riff that i can not hear in this version .
1	this is a good album . i like the song on this album .
0	i bought uptown funk because i wa looking for a more commercial prince record , and i wa disappointed . uptown funk is a good collection of song , but some of it is a bit too similar for my taste . i prefer the more varied sound of prince album , and this is not one of them .
1	i love all the song on the cd . i really really love the album .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i bought the mp3 download of the song . it is exactly what wa advertised .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	what a terrible song , i have downloaded it and will never use it again .
0	i like this song very much , and i am glad i can finally get a copy of it on cd .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	good song . i think that it is a good song . the song is very good , i love this song .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i wa just listening to this song on the radio and i have been listening to this song ever since and it is my favorite . i also have a copy of this song and i love it too . i have been listening to it all day long .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i hate buying used cd , but this is one of the few that i do . i have listened to it a lot and i really like it . i have never been in a relationship but it make me think twice about dating .
1	i have only listened to this album once , and i can say that it is a great album . i like the playing of the guitar player . i like the songwriting of the song . it also ha a great sound to it .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i have heard a lot of people say that this is a great cd , but i have never really heard anyone say that this is a great cd .
1	there is a rumor that this is a song about a woman who cheat on her husband with a local politician . a a woman who ha never had a man cheat on me i can not say what it mean , but i do not doubt it is true . i have been married to a good man for 33 year and he ha never cheated on me .
0	i like the song because it is interesting . the instrumentation is good but the chorus is not that memorable . the vocal are okay . i would like to hear the music that wa used to create this song better .
0	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i love this album . i wish i could play it by ear .
1	good , old-fashioned country and western . great instrumentation , excellent vocal delivery , and a really nice , smooth performance . if you like old-time country , this is a good listen .
0	i liked the sound of this song . i do not like the sound . it is a beautiful song , but i do not like the sound .
0	the lyric are hard to understand . it is a little hard to sing along with .
1	i love her song and this one is my favorite !
1	i wa a huge fan of this song way back when i wa young . i sang it with my mom every time i visited her in her nursing home .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	this is a great song . i love it .
1	a great theme song for this show .
0	this album is my favorite of all time . the production is very good , and the lyric are very good . the only problem is i have a hard time listening to them in the car . i have to crank it up so loud that i can hear the song over the radio . i really like it .
0	i am a huge fan of sam sparro on idol . i would rate this cd a a 7. it is no wonder that she wa so popular on the show . she can sing and performs at a good level . i like her style of singing .
0	this track is okay . i am not really a fan of the vocal on this album . i did not really like the overall music on this release . the song is decent , but i would have to say that the vocal are not the best part of this album . i think that this is one of the weaker track on the album .
1	her voice is so good , so natural , and so wonderful . this cd is a great way to start off the new year ! i would recommend her . i have listened to this cd , but i have not bought any of her cd yet . i will buy them when i find them .
1	this app rock ! we use it at church !
0	this is a great album , but not for me . i like the different music , but i wish the music wa more varied , perhaps with more song .
0	i bought it for my son and myself because we like to listen to country music . this is a great song and it is really easy to understand and listen to . i love it ! we are fan of your site and we will buy more of your song if you have more .
1	the dave clark five are an awesome group . i love their music !
1	this is a great song . it is energetic and ha a great message . the lyric are great , and the melody is catchy . the instrumentation is great .
0	the only thing that i can say about this cd is that it wa recorded by a woman . it did not have to be , but it wa . the song were good and the music wa good . it wasnt great , but i do not think it would be either . i do not think it should have been listed a a self-titled cd .
0	i really like this song . it is not a bad song .
0	i am not a fan of pop song . pop music , even when it is good , is not good enough to sing in front of god . i do not like pop music . i like christian music . i like christian music . i like christian music that is good . i like christian music that is good . this cd is good . i like this cd . this cd is good . i like this cd . i like this cd . i like this cd .
0	this is one of my favorite album of 2011. the songwriting is fantastic and the artwork is a great touch .
1	i love this song and the video too . i like the rhythm of this song and the song is fun to dance to . i love the concept behind this song and the music video too .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this song suck . it is really just a cover of an old skool song . this is a cover of a song that came out in 1982. if you like the original song , then this cover is a good buy .
1	i really like it . it is a great song . i would like to buy it on the cd .
0	i agree with the others that this is a horrible cd . i do not like it , but i do not think i would burn it . i can understand the bad song . the production is so bad that it is hard to understand what is going on . they are trying to get your attention with the good song . it is a good cd if you like the good song . it is a bad cd if you like the bad song .
0	i really really like this song .
0	it is a funny song , but the lyric are pretty bad . the only good part is that there are a few line before the chorus that make you think , who would write this ? .
1	very interesting song .
1	this recording is nothing short of a miracle . the performance is simply beautiful . it is a perfect example of how a pianist can communicate so much in his music that just by listening to it you really know how he feel .
1	i love the song . i love the version of it a well . it is an awesome song , but my favorite version of it is the one with the original version and it is original version .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this album sound like a bunch of diva , who is trying to imitate barbra streisand .
1	the bassline is great , and the music is really good . i can not believe that this song did not sell many copy .
1	i have been listening to this cd for more than a month and i have enjoyed every song . i especially like some good year .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	what a great collection of music . i enjoyed listening
0	this is a live concert recording that wa recorded on tape . the sound quality is poor , and i do not think it wa mastered . the recording wa mixed by an amateur , and the vocal are scratchy and poorly .
1	i loved this album . my kid thought it wa so pretty . i love her song .
0	i really enjoyed this album but i did not like the song .
1	i love this song , i have played it many time and will continue to play it . the video is well done , and also the lyric speak for themselves . the only thing that could make this song more special is if it sounded like a recording .
0	the album is a great album and i am glad i found this collection of song . the song are fun , the r & b song is the best i have heard . the album is one of the best album for this year . i will purchase again .
0	i first heard the music when i wa in middle school when i wa walking past the record store . i have been a fan of lareine since then . their music is very well produced and their instrumentation is top notch .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	this song reminds me of my mom . i really like it . it is very catchy , the backing melody is cute , and the lyric are really good .
0	i do not think you can go wrong . if you like her music you will probably like this cd . if you are a fan of her music you will not like this cd . i would not buy this album . i do not think it is worth the money and time . i am not a fan of this artist . there are better artist out there .
0	i bought this song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i thought it wa great .
0	this album is a mess . i bought it because i needed a cheap album that wasnt terrible . i am glad i got this . it is cheap . so , it is not terrible . it is just a mess . i do not like david lee roth . i hate his music . but , i am glad i bought this . it is not terrible . it is not great . it is just a mess . the worst part is that this album doe not have any of that great guitar , or vocal . it just sound like it wa made by a drunk .
0	i love all of your music .
0	loved the song , but would much rather listen to the album now
1	i am glad i went for this album . it is my first time getting a demo and i do not regret my decision . it is so good . it is all i expected it to be .
0	prince is back . i am really happy , because i always wanted to hear him play some of his song . i guess that i am not the only one who think this is his best , so i am happy . maybe he will do a new album again ?
1	i am a big fan of miley cyrus and i have been patiently waiting for her cd . but , i have to say this : i could not get my hand on this cd once it wa released . this is the first time i have ever been disappointed by a cd i ordered . i will not be ordering any more of mileys cd until this is changed .
1	a true gem . this band is truly unique in the world of electronic music that i have experienced . their sound is so unique that you will find a lot of people that like them . i am a huge sucker for any new electronic music .
0	i love rap music , especially r. kelly .
0	well i think this is a good song , but i think it is boring . the lyric are repetitive . i wa bored out of my mind .
0	this is not a new album , but it ha been out for a quite a few year now .
1	this is one of the good song . i am not sure what it is about , but it is very catchy . i like this song a lot because it is very easy to sing along to . this is one of the good song .
1	this is old , but i like the song . it is a good song .
1	i love this cd . i really like the song , and the music is really good . i love this band . i love this cd . i love this cd .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	although the song is very repetitive , the guitar solo is great . the only negative is that it seems a little overdone in the bridge .
0	i have only just started listening to this album , and i am enjoying it . it is an energetic album and a few of the track are really good . the instrumentals are extremely beautiful and this album ha a great message . there is a good mix of track here and the song do change quite a bit .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i really enjoy this album .
1	the app is great and i have heard some really great christmas song . i love this app and would definitely use it again and again .
1	i would like to thank whoever wrote this song . it
1	i had only ever heard beatles song before . i heard this album for the first time this week and i wa amazed at the musical quality of it . i wa amazed at how good the beatles sound on this album . i really enjoy this album and can not wait for the next one .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i like the song . the lyric are very true .
1	if you are looking for a new christian album - this is it ! if you are looking for a good christian album , this album is it .
0	i love it ! i will give it a four star because the song is awesome .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i am a huge fan of this band .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i wa so excited to open the cd because i had heard that it wa one of the best album of the year . i wa happy when i heard the song and the album wa really good .
0	i am sorry to say i do not really like this song . it is a good song , but i do not really get it .
0	this is one of the most underrated cd of all time . this cd is a great way to get you moving !
0	this is the first time i have listened to this song a it ha been in the radio pretty much all of my life . i first heard it wa on the radio in 1990. i like the song very much and i love the video a well .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	it is amazing . i can not stop playing it because it is so good . i am a huge beatles fan . these are the best album ever .
1	i love it .
1	i love the song on this album and i think that jp will be a very successful artist in the future .
0	it is a nice collection of song . it is good , but not great .
1	i think this is the best song . it is fun and different . i would listen to it more often .
1	i just bought dc5 because i like the dave clark five . i really love the title track . dave clark 5 is the best band ever !
0	i like this album a lot .
0	i hate this song . this song is terrible ! every time i listen to this song it make me want to kill myself . this song is not worth the money . you could just play it for your friend and they would think it is good .
1	larein is a really good song !
1	i love her voice .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	when i wa in high school , i would listen to this song every day . i thought it wa a great song .
1	this is a good song but i do not like it a much a some of the others on the cd .
1	this is an album about the love of god . the lyric are very positive and the song are positive a well . i am pleased with the album . this is a good christian cd .
0	i love the way he sings with his hand in the air . it is very cool . the only drawback is that it ha a lot of the same tune that you can hear in any number of other recording . there is nothing that i have ever seen that make this album better than any other album i have ever heard .
0	i have been a fan of amazon for a long time and i have never purchased anything other than amazon book , and i have enjoyed reading all of them . this wa a great product , and i hope you will continue to share your talent with the world .
0	my favorite of the 12 song is the best thing that never wa but i love the whole collection . it my all time favorite album and i can not believe it is over a decade old . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it come in a nice jewel case . it is got a cool vibe with it is cool production and it cool packaging , so i would definitely recommend it . it is a perfect album for a classic rock fan . i can not believe this is going to be in my collection for a long time .
1	this is an awesome album . it is full of great song . i listen to this album at least twice a week . i love the song that are in this album .
0	this cd ha a nice voice . i can not figure out why more people do not like it .
1	i like dave clark five .
0	i have a love-hate relationship with christmas music . i love christmas music , but i hate it when people try to make it their own . this is a great collection of christmas music and a classic . i find the vocal more impressive than the music . i have this cd many time each year and i have always found it very enjoyable .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this cd doe not belong on this website . the sound quality is awful and the lyric are boring . i had to listen to this cd several time to finish it . the only thing i liked were the band member .
1	this is a really good album . i really like the production , i think it is great .
0	i love brandy .
1	this is a wonderful album , and i would call it a gift to any music lover . it is the music and the presentation that is special .
1	i have been waiting for the day when i could listen to this collection of recording of music , without having to pay $ 20.00 a disc . this is the best collection of music i have ever heard , and i have heard them all , and i have listened to them all . they are all great and have that wonderful it about them .
0	this is a very good song .
0	the best version of the song i have heard . i like the instrumentation that go along with the vocal .
0	the dave clark five are an interesting group , but their music is more like a movie soundtrack than actual music . this is a fantastic version of this song .
1	this cd is the only release from this band that i have listened to in the past year or so . i loved it . i am not sure why , but i did not get over it fast enough . jon lord .
1	i love the music and the video . this album is awesome !
0	i like this song a lot ! it is a good song ! it is a little slower than the other song , but it is perfect for the slow time in life . great slow song ! i like this song a lot .
1	the original is better . this song is terrible . i love this song !
1	i have never heard this song before and i love it .
0	it is ok , but it is not good .

0	the movie is better than this song .
1	it wa worth the download . i would recommend this song to others .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	great tune-very smooth . could be a lot better if the band wa together .
0	this song ha the most amazing lyric and i do not care if it is just another song or not , but it is a great song .
0	a very good song , that ha a very strong message .
0	r.kelly is one of the most creative artist and musician to have ever lived .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i like this cd . it sound like they are having a good time .
0	i love a very special christmas but i would have preferred a very special love song .

0	i have to say that this song really doe make me feel like i am in church . i like the original better , but this is one of my all time favorite song . i like the movie version of this song better , but this is my all time favorite song .
0	i would love to have my friend listen to these song .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	the sound quality is great ! the song is a classic and i enjoy listening to it ! i wa disappointed that the lyric were different from the version of the song i sang in elementary school . the lyric are the same and the melody is great . i like this version !
0	i love john williams . i have been listening to this album for year now . i love the sound of the piano in the back ground . i wish i had a piano like that a a child . i am a big fan of johnny cash . i also like willie nelson .

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	it is a song that is about love and commitment , but it is not a love song . i think she is just singing about how much she love her boyfriend .
1	i am going to buy this cd . this cd is really good . i love the music .
0	this song wa a very sad song , and it is sad because it make no sense . i do not like this song at all .
0	this is my favorite cd by reo speedwagon . i think they are the best rock & roll band in the world . i used to listen to them when i wa in high school .

1	i like this song .
0	i am new to this website and have been trying to find information about the recording and it is release . since you have written such a great review , i would like to know more about this album so i can research it further .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	very good album - well played , well sung , and a little different .
0	it is very difficult to find good music on cassette . i do not know why this is so , but i have not found it . i just bought a tape of this album and i love it .
0	the cd is about a good a it get . no song is bad . she is pretty , but not enough to make the cd worth it . if you do not care for song and want to hear a nice voice-this is the cd to get .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	very nice ! loved the way it wa sung ! i have seen it used in a lot of show , but it never got to that point .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i wa very disappointed to find that the cd wa scratched to the point that at least it is not playable anymore and the track are not good to listen to . i wa very happy to find this cd to be a good a it wa when i first received it . i will probably buy the cd again to get a better copy .
1	i love this album . the song are very good and i think the lyric are very meaningful . i just wish there wa more on the cd .
0	i like how they do it . it is very good .
0	he is one of the most creative artist out there . i have been listening to his music since the early 90 and i have only been able to listen to it and enjoy it since this album came out .
0	dave clark five : when i first moved to memphis , in 1969 , it wa the dave clark five and the memphis horn who introduced me to the blue . the fact that i am writing this review today almost 50 year later is proof that the dave clark five will not only always be one of my favorite blue band , but also one of my best friend . the band wa a huge success live , and this is the last time i will ever see them , in memphis . i am a fan , and i have seen many of the original member of this band . the dave clark five wa a great group . i wa lucky enough to have seen them live . i met the band in atlanta , georgia , in the early 1970s . i wa there with some friend . the dave clark five recorded a lot of great song , and i have many of my favorite on my cd collection . i have been a fan since 1973 , and i am lucky to have found such a great group . i will always be a fan of the dave clark five , and this is the last time i will ever see them .
0	i have been looking forward to this cd for a few year now , and i finally got it . i love the album cover , but i think the song itself is terrible . i like the cd , but i am disappointed with it .
0	this cd is a best of cd collection by the way . if you really love a band you can go to amazon and buy a compilation cd . if you are just looking for a best of cd then go to itunes and buy the entire cd . i have been a fan of all of the band on this album since i first heard them in the early 80 . the song on this cd are great ! i have it in the background all the time . it is a great collection .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i find the song by this artist to be one of the most beautiful song i have ever heard . this is a very very very nice song .
0	this cd is a very good cd , but it is definitely not a good a the others .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i don ` t like the music video . the song is not very attractive .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
1	i loved the album when i first heard it on the radio . but i never had it on my ipod . i have been searching for it for several day now , but can not find it anywhere . it is been a long time since i have heard this album . please get it to me !
0	i love this beatles song . i do not know why , but the word in this song just make me happy . it is so melodious and sweet . i just like the way the word make me feel . i love this song !
1	i bought this cd for my wife , she love the band . she ha a great sense of humor .
0	i can not sing this song .
1	this song brings back so many memory . i think i love this song .
0	this is a great song ! very catchy , and the melody is very good . i saw sam sparro on idol and thought he wa a cool guy , but i wa not really impressed by his singing either . he is a great singer and songwriter , and i hope he continues his career . he ha a nice voice . allan bole
0	i have bought everything prince ha released . i wa listening to some of his album and heard that they were about his death . i bought this album and listened to it . i like it but i do not like it . it is a good album , but it is not my favorite .
1	i saw this video on my facebook newsfeed today when i wa in the bath thinking about my day . i found it very beautiful and inspiring . the lyric are brilliant and the chorus is so powerful . i would recommend this to everyone !
1	i think this album is a little bit too long . you have to really listen to it . it take awhile to finish . it is a good song though . it ha a good beat . i like the song . i am glad i bought the album though .
1	i like this album ! this is a great album ! i love the song and i like the album . i am looking forward to a reissue !
0	this is an okay song . the mix and the quality of the track is fine . the song start out with a slower tempo , but continues on to a faster one . the intro is good and i like the song . the album is average a far a i am concerned .
0	this is not a good song at all . i do not think it deserves any rating at all . the video is just plain ugly and boring .
0	it is great and i have done it too .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i like this album a lot ! i found myself dancing and humming along to it . it is got a good groove to it . the song are good . the only one that i have a problem with is the best is yet to come , but that is pretty much my only complaint . i really like the song on this album , but they are not my favorite song . i could still listen to them all day . like i said earlier , this is definitely an album worth getting .
0	i like this song but i do not know what the meaning is . i do not know why or where i heard the song . the song is fun and energetic but i do not know if it is a good song or not . the song is ok .
0	i just watched a youtube video about a different singer named lyle may . he is a very talented singer who ha been a big influence on me . i like his music , but i do not know if i would describe it a a hymn or not . i also really enjoy the chorus and the singing of the lyric . when i watch the video , i think it would be right to say it is a hymn
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	this cd is very nice . i bought it because the cover is so beautiful . it is very relaxing . i would recommend it .
1	this is the most beautiful cd that i have ever heard .
1	great album . it is great to listen to because of the amazing song and the amazing musician who play them .
1	i do not know what to say except that i love the album . the cd is outstanding and i have listened to it over and over again . i am not sure why i did not buy this cd earlier , but i love the song . this is my favorite record of the year .
1	listen to this cd when you have a boring day , it is very relaxing
0	this song wa really cool . it sound like the dave clark five version and i like it .
0	this album is just okay . i have heard that people are just not that into this band and that it is because of their sound . to me , it is because of the lack of musical diversity . they have a lot of good song but it is just not diverse enough to make the album interesting . this is the only cd i have ever really disliked by the dave clark five .
1	i love the sound of ohearns music . the music is very relaxing and the lyric are very profound . i also love the fact that he us the drum a his main instrument and that is something i have never come across before . the drum are very good indeed and that is what make the music very satisfying . his other instrument is the piano and that is another instrument that i have never encountered before . i think he is the best of the best and if i wa to choose one artist to listen to then i would have to say that i would have to go for ohearn .
1	i got this album when i wa going on tour but i did not have enough money to buy ticket and i saw that it wa on sale so i bought it . i do not usually buy album . but i saw i had it on sale and i thought i would get it for free . i am glad i did . i think it is a great album .
1	this song ha been covered by several artist , but i personally like this version better . however , the vocal are just not right for this style of music . this song is well produced and arranged . it is a nice song .
1	this song is good . i like the song . it is a great song . i like the song . it ha great melody . it ha a great chorus . it ha great instrumentation . it is a good song . it is a catchy song . it is a great song . i am not quite sure where the bad review are coming from . this song is a great song and a great songwriter . i have listened to every version she is ever recorded . this is a great song . it is a great song .
0	i have seen this cd on amazon for over a year and i have never bought it . i do not know why . i saw that it wa available on itunes , but i have not ordered it . what i have instead is a cd of music from a friend and i like the song a lot . i think this would be a good addition , but i am not really going to pay any price of $ 60 for this . i am just not . i think hasselvander is an idiot for writing these review . this is not worth buying . it is a waste of money . you would think that he would just buy the cd himself , which is what i would do in his place . i would not buy this for $ 60 .
0	i have heard this cd before , but i do not know if i like it . it is a cd i have heard before , so i like the cover art .

0	this is the most interesting trance album i have ever heard .

0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	i have listened to this album several time since i wa a kid . i had no idea at the time that this wa the album that inspired the movie groundhog day . i first listened to the album when i wa about 10 , maybe 11. i always loved the album and the song that ha stuck with me the longest is time is on my side . this song also inspired one of my favorite movie groundhog day . it ha always been one of my favorite song . it is not hard to find this song on youtube .
0	i had the same thing happen to me a a lot of the other reviewer . i downloaded the first two or three song and they were fine , but after that i had to turn it off .
0	this is a great cd , but not the best . it is an overproduced cd
1	i love this tape ! it ha all the best part of classic rock , and even includes a beatles song . the story is also very good .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	this is my second time listening to this cd . the first time i purchased the cd wa for a friend . i had already put the cd in my truck and wa on my way to work . i pulled up to my work and decided to take a quick jog to the store to get gas . a i wa driving i looked in the cd player and noticed a cd that i had purchased earlier . i decided to play it and it turned out to be a compilation cd of song and vocal by the beatles . i played it , hoping that i could hear some of the song that i had heard before . i wa very disappointed to find out that these were just the same song that i had already heard . i wa about to return the cd to my friend when i realized that i might have been able to enjoy the cd much more if i had listened to it a second time . after thinking about it i decided to listen to it for about a week and then i would return it . the second time i listened to it i bought it . i wa amazed at the number of outstanding song . i had already heard a lot of these song and did not like any of them . but , after listening to this cd for a few time i can tell that i am going to like it . i will most likely buy it for my own personal collection .
1	so far so good . i have been playing this album since the first time i heard it in 1995 , and it is still a favorite .
1	for the first time ever , the beatles have released a song that is not on their classic album . i am glad to hear it . i am glad to hear this album . i have listened to this album more than 10 time , and it is very good . this is the beatles . this is the best beatles album . this is the best beatles album that i have ever heard . this is the greatest beatles album that i have ever heard . this is the greatest beatles record that i have ever heard . this is the greatest beatles album that the beatles have ever made . this is the greatest beatles album that ever wa ! this is one of the greatest beatles album . this is the greatest beatles album ever ! this is the greatest beatles album ever ! this is the greatest album ever ! this is the greatest beatles album ! this is the greatest beatles album ever ! this is the best beatles album ever ! this is the best beatles album in the world ! this is the greatest beatles album ever ! this is the single greatest beatles album ever ! this is the greatest beatles album ever !

1	sam sparro performs this song on the popular radio show the voice of america in 2011 , and he wa asked a lot of question about his work and his fan . the first song he sang wa black and gold , which he say is one of his favorite song . he said

1	i have had this cd for several year and i am still surprised by how much i like it .
0	: i bought this a a gift for my girlfriend , and i think she will like it . i like it a lot .
1	this wa a big disappointment for me , but not that bad . this is a great record , but it is too long . this is the first time i have ever been able to listen to a cd at the same time , then put it back together and listen to it again . you have to be patient with this album .
1	love it ! i love this song . i think it is very good . i hope the album is better .
0	this is my favorite of all the album . the song the boy i will never be is very sentimental and the song the boy i will never be is very sad , but when i heard that song and the piano riff i just about cried .
0	my first impression of this recording wa that it sounded like the piano playing the same note over and over again , but the piano played them very softly . the next impression wa that the recording sounded like the piano wa played by a ghost . it wa not a very good recording , but i liked it .
1	this is the best album i have listened to this year
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i bought this album because i had heard good thing about it on amg . and it is not terrible . but man , i am really disappointed . it is just a mess . the vocal are bad . the guitar and piano are good . but the vocal are bad ! i did not know david lee roth could make that bad . i am really disappointed . if you are a fan of the david lee roth , this is for you .

1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

1	i love this song so much , even though i had to turn it up . i think it is the most beautiful song out there , which is why i have to turn it up . it is got the most beautiful , melodic and beautiful note that i have ever felt . i felt the same way about whitney whitney and mariahs whitney . the song is so beautiful and special that i would love to hear it on a big screen . i think i will have to listen to it at full volume to appreciate it properly . it wa a very short movie . i love it . it make me feel good .

0	the dave clark five , jewel and john fahey are the band that i listen to most . i think of them a the three musketeer for having such a strong music history and a a group i feel like tiger moon is better than i am beginning to see the light . i will be buying both of the tiger moon cd a soon a i can .
1	i am very pleased with this album . it is very well put together . the only problem is it sound like it wa made by a high school band . but , after listening to it on the tape , i realize that it is supposed to sound like it wa made by a high school band .
0	not worth the money . the music is pretty good , but the packaging is awful . i have two piece of this stuff in my car and now i am very displeased to find that only one of them actually work . i will return the cd to amazon and they will refund my money , but i will not buy another copy of this album until they fix the packaging .
1	i bought these cd to listen to while driving . they make me feel relaxed and i enjoy them .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .

1	i love the cover , a very attractive looking album .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !

0	this is the worst in the history of broadway show . the lyric are so bad that you can not believe anyone would say them . the song are all about being alone and/or about having a relationship . the lead singer ha no vocal talent . he sings like a robot . if this wa a movie , it would be laughed at . it is a terrible album .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .

1	i love the clean vocal .
0	i like her singing . great but i wish it could be longer .
0	i really like the dave clark five , but i am not a big fan of the music . i like the melody and the whole concept of the album , but the music just seems a bit too bland to me .
1	this song wa a gift to me from a friend of mine . i am very glad i heard it . this is a very beautiful song . i hope this song is played on the radio and this time people really hear it . it is a very beautiful song . i believe this song is one of the best love song ever .
1	i thought i had heard it all , but i wa very pleasantly surprised by this album . i love the dave clark five . their music is sweet and always keep me listening .
1	the vocal are a little weak , but the band is great . the vocal work really well with the music and really fit the song . you can tell that the band is not having a bad time while they are on stage . it will be nice to see them live again , and i hope they get another grammy nomination . i know that they will not win though . this album is like a watered down version of the band at their best .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i just bought this album because i like ohearn . i like music in general , but i do not like ohearn . ( i did not listen to all of his album because i did not have enough money to buy the one i wanted , and i already have a lot of ohearn album . )
0	i pre order this cd . i thought it wa going to be the 1st cd in a series . i pre-ordered it . but , i wa disappointed . i do not like their music anymore .
1	this song is so damn catchy and easy to remember . i love it ! i really like the song , i am going to listen to it a lot and make sure that i buy the song .
0	i love this singer , but this album is nowhere near a good a her previous album . the first album wa way too poppy and the second one wa way too rock and roll . this album is better , but not by much .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	this song make me feel like a little kid .
0	this show had everything and i have heard that this ha been released on cd and i am looking forward to it . it is hard to decide what to say . it wa very interesting and i think the band played very fast and it wa a very special performance especially since each member played their own part . i am looking forward to the album and i hope that there are many more concert to come .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i bought this for a friend a a birthday gift . i am very happy with the purchase . the cd is really good . it ha a great tune , and the lyric are good and easy to understand .
1	this is my favorite keith album . this album is the soundtrack to my life . it is full of love . i wish i could say that wa the only reason i love this album . it is not . i love the lyric , the harmony , the song . i love the music . it seems like he is singing in a choir , a group of people singing together , singing for the one that they love , love that one love . it make me feel like i am in a room with a group of people singing together , singing for the one that they love . it make me feel like i am in a room with a choir singing to me . it make me feel like there is no better group of people anywhere in the world . i wish i could give everyone in the world this album . that would be the greatest gift anyone could ever give another human being . i love this album so much i can not even explain it . i do not know why it is my favorite of all time . i do not know why it is my favorite . i just know that i love it so much . i just keep listening to it over and over again . i wish i could tell everyone in the world about the beauty of this album . i wish i could give everyone in the world this album .

0	this is one of the best worship song . it ha a strong message and it go in an in a good direction .
0	i like the david bowie song hero .
0	i think that this is one of the best song ever performed by the beatles . if you listen carefully , you will hear that the opening part of the song is rocking . and the whole song is about the same . i do not know what rocking mean , but it sound cool . i wish that they had recorded it on a cassette tape so i could have listened to it again .
1	i love it .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i just found out about this band and i am super into them . i have heard the new song a couple time and i am stoked to be able to listen to the entire album , which is just an amazing album . i am a big fan of this band and the music is just so good . i just think they need a little more bass in their music . i think they are amazing !

1	i love this cd and have listened to it several time in the past few week . i really like the music and the message .
1	this song is another great song from this album . i wa hoping to see a more traditional gospel song , not so rock or country like . the sound quality is good , however , the song is a little boring to me . it ha a really nice guitar sound . the song is definitely a good album . it ha a very positive tone .

0	i love love this album . it is a musical journey for the listener and i am sure it .
1	i am not a big fan of country music . but , this artist is a favorite of mine , and he seems to be a good singer and musician . this album contains some of his best song . there is a lot of variety on the album , and it is a pretty good album . he can play a mean guitar solo , and he is a great singer . there are a few song that are a little repetitive , but these are still very good .
1	this band wa supposed to be the next led zeppelin , but they have been in the shadow of zeppelin for 10 year , so this is a bit of a letdown .

0	i can not find any good song on this cd . it is very dissapointing .
0	i like this album .
0	this is a really good version , but i have to say that this is the version i like the best . it is a very nice version . i have purchased the other version , but this is the only one that is really special to me . i have purchased some other version , but this is the only one that really stand out to me .
0	i have seen a few people say this album is boring , and i agree with them . it is not anything you would want to listen to all day , or all night . you would either get bored or you would get tired of it . it is different , but it is not for everyone . it is just not my cup of tea .

0	this is not a tom wait cd . it is a cd by the british band the goody . the goody were a british comedy act from the early 2000s . this is their first cd . they released a cd of their own song . this cd ha an average rating of one star on amazon . and this cd is not a tom wait cd . it is a good-looking cd of the goody song with a great jazz section . it is not a tom wait cd .
0	this is the most boring song on the album . the lyric are redundant , the music is corny . this disc is not worth buying .
1	i have been listening to jewel for many year . i love her music and i have the cd . i have been listening to the cd for about 3 week and i have to say that the cd is getting better and better . it is very very good .
0	this is another one that got away from the radio . it wa played for a while , i think when the song wa first released . i do not know if it got to be on the radio at the time because i do not remember it . i just hope people will continue to play it if they hear it .
0	it seems like a good song , but it is just not a good song . it is not a great song , it is just not a good song . the vocal are great but the sound quality is terrible .
1	this is definitely one of the best live album ever ! and if i had to pick one song to describe this album it would be heartbreak hotel . it is one of the best of the best . there is a reason this song is # 1 on many
0	i have this cd for a couple of month , never listened to it , but , it is a good cd . it is a hard rock cd , but i like it .

0	i like miley . i like the music . i like the video . i like the lyric . i am not miley . i am not miley . i do not like this song . i do not like this song . i do not like her .
0	i really like this band . they are not a huge favorite in my book . their song are not my cup of tea either , but i really enjoy their music . i do not understand why they are not more popular . i guess it just is not their time right now .
0	i like it when people have a good idea . if you want to be popular , you have to have a good idea .
0	this is the best album by the old 97s i have ever heard . i would give it a 3. it is not the best cd i have ever listened to , but it is the best i have ever heard . i would get the cd of fool for love and the cd of dancing with . i would give them a 5 and a 3 .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	this is a great worship album .
0	this cd is by far the worst cd i have bought . i have already spent more money on this cd than i have spent on any cd i have bought in the past . this cd is so bad that i had to listen to it twice to be sure i had not bought it . i am now thinking about going back to buying my music from the dollar store . this cd is so bad that i probably would have been better off if i had just bought a cd from the dollar store . this cd is by far the worst cd i have ever bought .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	this song made me feel good . it is a very good song . i love the way the song is structured and the
1	this song is a little annoying . the drum are so loud i am afraid to turn up the volume . the second time one of the song start over i do not want to turn the volume on my cd player up because i want to know what the song is .
0	i like the song ( mp3 download file of i like that ) , with good sound quality a well . it is a decent song , but the song lyric are a little redundant . this song is a little different from the other song on the album , but it still work .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	it is a prince album , but it is not a prince album by prince . prince had a great voice , and he ha a good ear for music . this album is not good , but it is good . i like this album . it is a good album .
1	i received this a a christmas gift-and i could not be happier . there wa nothing on the cd to indicate what wa in this , but i wa excited to hear something new . i love the song , and i love the people . the album is a combination of worship , and praise , and the song are all very well written , and very well sung . the vocal are amazing !
1	this is a great album for those who like classical music . while it is not the big band album i wa hoping for , it is still enjoyable and worth picking up .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	an oldie but goodie - a real old-school blues-rockers ! it is the best blues-rock in year . if you like it , you will like it .

1	loved this cd ! it wa the only album i had not listened to yet . i am very happy with this purchase .
0	the best song here is little willy ( m.v.j.o.r.a.s.a.s.m ) by jvj . the song is played well , and the backing is great . i love this song , it is been played on the radio since the late 1970s . it is a simple , funky , and very fun song .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	very cool song . the song wa good but i do not really know the meaning of the song anymore . the song is fun .
1	a good listen though .
1	i found this song for free on the internet . it wa really good . i would buy the album for sure .

1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	this is a very good album . i like the dave clark five a lot . i wish i could get them on the radio .

0	lorde , the song are good , the band is great , and i love the music of this band .
1	this song is a very good song . the video is nice and ha a good flow .
1	this is a great song to play on your ipod while you are waiting in line at the doctor . the lyric are very meaningful .
1	i did not know that this song wa on a cd until i saw the cover on amazon . i could not believe it . it is from the movie tootsie with the voice of jack lemmon . it wa used in the movie a the theme song . i could not believe it wasnt on a cd . it wasnt until i saw the amazon cover that i realized i had to buy it . i wa really excited because the song wa on a cd . i have been a fan of the movie ever since i saw it in theater . i could not believe that this song wa on the cd and i would never seen it on a cd . i am totally sold on this cd . i love to listen to it when i drive by the radio station . the song is one of my favorite .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	the cd ha been out of print since the 70 , so i wa excited to hear that a new edition is now available . but the cd just did not live up to the hype . the vinyl wa better , but the cd is just a good .
0	i have been a fan of both jps record for sometime . i like the sound of this cd . i have listened to this cd a few time and i really like the guitar solo on the last song .
0	i will be buying more of her album in the future .

1	this cd ha a lot of different song . i will listen to the other song before i buy this cd
1	if you like this bonnie tatum cd you will love this album by bonnie tatum . i wa very excited about this album because of the word and the music . i can not wait for the next album .
1	tom scott is a great musician and a great person . he ha a great story , great voice , and ha had a great career . i really enjoy his music . i do not need to say anything else . this is my favorite album up to now . i love the music . soooo good . i am in total agreement with all the other comment . you have to hear this . just have to listen to it . it is a great piece of music . enjoy .
1	this song is very sweet and very well sung .
1	love is a four-year-old child , sings e.s.posthumus on the opening track , love is a four-year-old child . who is this fellow ? e.s.posthumus is a name that may be unfamiliar , but he is no stranger to the world of music . his music is the sound of an alternative to the typical rock music that come out of the united state . the music he make is something he say is not commercial , but is very , very pop . the song are upbeat , and the lyric are very much related to the lyric on the beatles lucy in the sky with diamond . the song are fast and upbeat , and the lyric are a bit more direct than what you might hear in the typical pop music , but they still fit within the pop format of the song . many of the song on the album have a lot of pop music influence , while others have a little bit more of a rock sound . there are also song that are very much like the beatles , but also rock song a well . the album is about an innocent love that can be found in all of our life . the song love is a four-year-old child is about a young girl who is trying to let go of her parent and life , but can not find the right people to help her . you can find a description of the album on the band website .
1	i love this album . the thing that get me is the sound quality . i can not get past how it sound like a cell phone . so , even at a little bit of volume it is horrible . i had to turn it down a bit to make it workable . i like the instrumentals , but that is it .
0	a great mix of genre . i am a fan of this band . i have been listening to them since i wa a kid . they are my favorite . i think they are underrated . they are playing all over the country . they seem to be doing great . they are on good company . they have a lot of good music in their catalog . i would love to get their new album . i would love to get the video of their latest song . i think they are doing great .
1	this is a good album , a far a i can see . it ha the standard song , but it also ha some song that i think are very good . i like i am going home and god love the best . the album is pretty good . the music is good . it is not the best album , but it is a good album . i like it .

0	i love this album . it wa a great addition to my collection .
1	this song is sooo fun and make me want to dance ! it would be very nice to sing along with her if you are not a singer . i love it when she sings in the lyric .
0	what a waste to put this on a cd , what a waste to make it a cover , what a waste to make it sound like gnr . this is nothing special . do not waste your time on it .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i like your version of this song ! it is very nice !
1	i really enjoyed listening to this cd ! it wa a little weird at first , but that wa just because i wa in the middle of listening to a bunch of other cd .

1	sam sparro from u-men is a pretty nice guy . he is an american who ha written a couple song for a japanese band . he is done well on idol and can actually sing a little . he is cute and fun and doe not take himself seriously . i am glad he is a nice guy because he need to go to japan and visit his band .
0	i really like this song . it is good . it is a good song .

0	the way it wa delivered wa very disappointing and i had to go to other site to find it . it wa extremely slow to download . no one is even interested in this song . i have a feeling the disc is cursed and will never come out for me to listen to . it is one of the worst one i have ever downloaded .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	marie osmond will always be a queen in my heart . a queen of many facet and a queen of the pop world . she had the strength and the talent to make a huge impact on our music and the world . but she ha also become one of the most commercial singer i have ever heard . her voice will never be the same again . i can not say it will be better , but i can say that i will never forget it .
1	this cd is great , very easy to understand and to listen to . i have been listening to this cd for about a month now and i am getting lot of great tune in my head . i would suggest this cd for all age
1	i have listened to this cd over and over again and it continues to grow on me . a.b.-m .
1	i loved the music on this tape , but the story wa not a good . there wa not a lot of detail in the story , and it just left me wanting . i did like i do not want to be lonely and the story of my life .

0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	this site is awesome ! a great site .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	this is a good song . it is the best on this album . i like it , but i have to say it wa one of the weaker song on the album . i am very partial to the lead in and out , especially in i never had a dream . it is one of my favorite song on this album , and it wa a very good choice for the song . if you like the song you will like the album .
0	the video is good but i would not say that it wa a good video . it wa very boring . she wa not singing very well . she wa not very good . it did not have any real emotion at all .
0	i don t know what this song is about , but it is one of my favorite !
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	if you read the comment on here , you will see that people have liked this album . it is a very good album for a change . it is not a classic album . it is not an album that people should listen to all the time . just listen to it out of the car , or while waiting for school to end . it is a good album to listen to when you want a good party , or something to put in the car .
1	i hope you enjoy your new cd . i love it ! it wa a great experience . i am so happy to have made this cd with you . i wa nervous about how the cd would turn out , but i think it turned out great . i hope you will enjoy the cd , and i hope you will buy me some drink . i will be at the store . i will buy you a drink .

0	i am new to the artpop band and i have been listening to this song for a while now . it is still one of my faves .
0	a surprisingly good song , with a catchy dance beat
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	it is very easy to love a song by the beach boy , but this one is pretty much a let down . very catchy , but not very interesting or memorable .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
1	i like these guy , i like the song . i like the song because it is a new song from a new band ( that is like saying that i do not like a band because i have never heard of them ) , but it is fun to listen to their music . i like the fact that it is different from the other song on their album . i like the fact that it is very positive and uplifted .

1	i really like this cd . i think that the instrumentals are great . i like the piano player .
1	this song wa a really good song ! i have several song at this point that i can never get enough of .
1	i agree with the other reviewer who said this cd wa garbage but i thought this would have made it to the top ten . i thought it would have been up there with flahooley or carrie . not all of the song are bad , however . the cd itself is pretty good with some good song . i also heard an interview with her on radio . i liked what she had to say a lot . i liked the cd for what it wa and i am glad i found it .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i really enjoyed this album . i really enjoyed the band voice , they were very good . i would like to hear more of their album though . they had a good sound to them . i give this album four star because i enjoyed it .
1	it is my favorite album of all time , the lyric are great , but i love the album cover ! it is my favorite album ever , the lyric are great , but i love the album cover ! the album cover is great and ha a great theme . it wa great to see her on letterman . she is always entertaining and she is really funny , i do not think i have ever seen her more excited about anything than she wa in this interview . i would recommend this album to anyone who love art and music . i think it is great , but i love the album cover !
0	oh wow ! i just bought the whole cd . love the music .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is a nice blue cd . the vocalist are very good at their craft and the instrumentation is really good . i wish there wa a little more variety in the instrumental music . it ha a nice bluesy feel to it and is definitely a good starting point to get the ballad going .
0	it is not bad , but not good either .
0	i just pre-ordered miley cyrus debut cd but i can not get my hand on it . i am a huge fan of miley cyrus but i am so disappointed by this . i will not be ordering any more of her cd until this is fixed .
0	this cd is very nice . i love the song that came on the cd .
1	i purchased the cd from the website . it say brandy featuring wanya morris . it doe not say this on the cd . i would not recommend this .
1	i wa introduced to this by a friend , and now i can not live without it . i wa introduced to this album by a friend and i have listened to it ever since , and it ha been with me for everything i have done . it ha been more than just a music album , it ha been a personal experience for me a well . i have lost track of how many time i have listened to this album , and each time it ha been like nothing else i have ever listened to . it is very different from anything else i have listened to , and it ha always been different . i think this is the best album i have ever heard , and i want to hear the band break through and do something that no other band ha done before . i want to hear them be a great a they are in this album . i hope they do it before it is too late .
1	it is got a great cover , with a killer band name . i do not know if you know these guy , but they are one of my favorite band . they have a lot of great song they wrote for themselves . their song have a very unique sound . they do a lot of cover . they are an incredible band .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	i like miley . i like the first song .
0	this song is really something . it is very well-written and jewel doe a great job singing it . the rhythm is pretty good , and the melody is pretty good . the only thing i do not like is the title . i do not like that the song is called i wan na but i do not mind it . it is a good song .
0	this album ha been called one of the best record of all time . it is a little bit of a stretch for me , since i have been so preoccupied with the like of nirvana , my bloody valentine , and sigur ro . but i did enjoy this one . the song on this album are all very catchy and have a great beat to them . the song have a very catchy pop-influenced beat and are great for jamming out to .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this is absolutely beautiful and a great song . i love the video and the lyric . i love all the note .
1	i love this song ! i love this song and i am going to buy it . this song is great .
0	i think this song is a hit , but it is not my favorite song . i like the song though .
0	i like this song but i do not think it is a really good song .
0	i like the song , but i do not like the lyric . i think it is a little bit racist .
0	i am not a big band guy . i do not like them . but when i heard this album for the first time in 1985 i had to have it . this album ha the most amazing song , the most amazing musician and most amazing lyric . i can not get enough of this album .
0	i thought the movie wa ok , but the song wasnt really bad . i do not know if it is the best , but it wa ok .
0	i love this song and have to admit that i am not a fan of country music . i love a lot of song , but i do not like country music . but when i heard this song on the radio last night , i put the volume at full blast and sat there in awe . if you have not heard this song or have never heard it , then this is for you . you just might be surprised . i love the song , i love the word , but i have to admit something . when you hear this song , you better have your eye shut . it make you cry , but you are scared to hear the word . it is an amazing song about two people who are supposed to have it all but one of them is missing the most important person in his life . i do not know if i have ever told you this , but i have always felt like i have been in love with my wife . i can not explain it . it is how it is . she is my whole world to me . my entire life revolves around her . but the one person that i am missing the most in my life is you . i am supposed to have everything , but you are the one man that i can not live without . i can not even explain it . you are my everything .
1	i know it is an old song , but i love the song .
1	i am not the best in the world at following trend , but this is one of the better one i have heard .

1	this is one of my favorite song . i love it !
0	i am not sure if this is a good cd . the sound is not great , and the playing is not better than most other jazz music . the music is just ok .
1	i love
1	i really enjoyed the album . a i had never heard her a a woman i wa a little surprised to find that she wa singing a a woman . i especially enjoyed the song some good year , that had a very unique and special quality . i wish there were more song on the album , but i am glad this album wa created . the album is a compilation of song that were written by her and never recorded on a single album .
1	love this song . and the album ! the song is really good . the song is upbeat . but the lyric are sad . so it make it a different song .
0	i wa excited to listen to this album for the first time . i had had some previous exposure to her but this wa my first album with her .

0	this album wa a re-recording of the same album . keith side wa a great guitarist , a great singer , and a good songwriter .
1	i love it . this is a really good song . i think this song is great . i do not know why i have not posted about it .
1	i like the dave clark five . i have many cd of them and i like them all . the first 20 minute or so i find it extremely relaxing . when that wear off , it is very annoying to get a cd of song you do not like . i bought this album because the cover is so gorgeous . it is nice and relaxing to listen to .
0	this song is not about the devil and he is not really in the song .
1	this is a very interesting album . i have been listening to it since it came out and enjoy it . the beatles were a group that wa very different from the folk group the byrd . it wa interesting to see how different the two group were .
0	i liked this song on the first rewatching . i liked it on the first rewatching on amazon , but then i stopped watching it .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	a great band with great song !
0	i really love this album . i wish they would have done this five year ago . i bought this after their show at the capitol theatre and wa completely blown away . the album is very well done with a lot of nice song . i can not wait to hear the rest of the album . i would give it five star if i could . - david
1	this song keep me from being depressed .
0	i think this song is catchy , but the lyric are not really appropriate for this song .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .

1	this is a great album .
0	this song wa very good , but i do not like it .

1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	this compilation is excellent . the track are all excellent , and the sound quality is excellent . i have heard disc with better sound quality , but this sound better than most . i had to turn the bass up on one of the track in order to hear it properly .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i have had this song on repeat for the past 5 day . it is so beautiful . i love the word and the simplicity of the melody . i am so happy that someone chose to sing this for me and that it is available on the radio . i am always surprised when i hear a song on the radio and it is not on the list . it is very inspirational . i have had this song on repeat all day . i just love it .
0	this album is a great one .
1	i never heard this artist before but i knew of him and this album wa well put together . the song are well done and well played . i would recommend this album to any tom wait fan .
1	hasselvander did a good job on the show . i do not know what happened with the itunes version of the show . if you do not have itunes , you have to check the website and download the song .

0	i downloaded a song to my ipod using this site , and now i have to delete it . i have done everything it say . it say delete , but i can not delete it . i deleted the file and clicked refresh , and nothing . can someone help me delete the song from my ipod ?
0	this is a great album that show the talent he ha . it ha many of his early song and one that is very good . the production is awesome . i think that they made the song too long . they should have cut the last two song off . i had to turn it off . i have only listened to a little of it . i would like to hear it in a better quality , though . i will give it a great review .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	i have been listening to e.s . posthumus for several month now and i really enjoy what i have heard . the playing is great and the singing is great .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this album feature a variety of track from the beatles early year . this song is a remake of do you want to know a secret ? it is a pretty nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a hit . it is a nice song but it is not a hit . it is not a very good song . it is not very good . it is not a very good song . it is not a very good song . it is not that good . it is not that good . it is not that good , but it is not a hit . it is not that good . it is not that good but it is not a hit . it is not that good .
0	i found this album at a thrift store and it wa soooo good . i liked the name , so i bought the cd . i am very disappointed . if you like this album , you will love it . but if you are disappointed . you will not buy it . very disappointing .
1	this cd is great because it includes a mixture of song that i grew up to like and song that i have not heard in a while . i am not sure if it is for me or not , but it is definitely worth a listen !
0	this cd is bad . i love tom scott , but this cd is not good . it is very disappointing . they do not deserve to be on the radio . it is a very disappointing cd . it only brings shame to this young man . i do not know why i like his music . i do not like this cd .
0	this wa the first grateful dead concert i had been to- and it wa a fantastic show . the energy level wa great , the venue wa packed , there wa a great atmosphere , and jerry garcia wa a great concert , singer , and leader .
1	this is my first jewel cd , and i am loving it ! she is got a great voice and a great songwriting style .
1	i bought this because i love prince . i love the artist . i love the record . i love the lyric and the music . i love the way you have mixed them . i am happy i bought it . i love it .

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i love this band . i think is very honest band play well , and i like the band but they sometimes play a little too much like , if i say , oh yeah , that wa a different tune every song
0	i am a fan of ohearn . i think his music is very good . this album is good , but i think there are many song that are repetitive . it is a good album if you like ohearns music or if you are a fan of old song .
0	this is a gift from my girlfriend . i love this album . she is awesome . i listen to this almost every day [ lover ] .

0	this album is a great album . i wa looking for a new album to buy and i found this one . i listened to the cd a little over a week ago . i have to admit that i wa a little bit surprised by the cd . it is a lot more upbeat than i wa expecting . the cd sound different than the cd i had heard before . i do not want to say it is better , but it is certainly different from the cd i had before . it is good , but it not great . it is a lot of fun . you can really tell that you are listening to a really good album . this is the kind of album i like . it is not a perfect album . but it is a lot of fun . it is very easy to listen to . the song are mostly great . and i really like the first cd of this album . this album is one of those cd that you just can not put down . if i had a recommendation for an album to buy i would go for this one .
0	i like the band , but this album is about a good a you can expect from them .
0	i like it a lot . the lyric on the album are a little bit repetitive , but the song are all good .
0	i am a big fan of this band , especially their first two album . i have been purchasing and listening to them for year .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i like this song , i have heard it in the radio twice and i like it .
0	this album is great . my daughter loved it and i am enjoying it too .
0	the first track never going back again is a great rock song , with a great guitar intro . the second track what is wrong with heartache is a great country song , but lack the rock influence . however , it is a very good song and a great start to the album .
1	i received this album yesterday and i love it . i really like the music and the concept . also , my husband and i are getting married in december , and i would like to find song that are appropriate for our wedding . i have already begun looking and listening to song that are appropriate . i really like allan bole music . and , he is very talented . i would highly recommend this album to anyone .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	these are two of my favorite song on the album . one is the funky christmas song , and the other is santa baby . i like both of them , but i thought the vocal were weak .
0	i like the lyric here .
1	you guy are awesome . i love how you guy take the best song of the 90 and make them into something new . thank you for bringing back great music into a world where it is mostly lost .
1	a great tun , i like sam sparro .
0	my wife and i got this cd . we listen to it every day . i do not know how it is , but we are listening to it almost everyday . the song are not bad , the lyric are not bad , the cd is not bad . but , it is just a waste of money . there were a lot of people who got this cd , but they did not love it . it wa a waste of money .
0	i love this record and it is my favorite record ever . if i had to name one of my favorite album i would say this one because of the amazing song , great lyric , and an amazing sound . this album deserves to be on my top ten list . i would rate this album an 8.5 out of 10 .
0	if you like country music , do not listen to this album , you would not like it if you like country music . i think this band would make a better hard rock band , not country music , and in my opinion , this band is not country music .
0	this song is sung by a very young woman with perfect pitch . you can hear it when you listen while playing the keyboard . the song is called breathe . it is the 2nd track on candy coated love but it is the first track on the album .
1	i wish they had made this album in a more traditional way . it is the best beatles album , in my opinion . i can not think of a single bad song on here ( unless i am forgetting one ) and it is a very easy listen to . and although they were not the best beatles , i know that they were at the top of their game .
0	this is an ok album . the song are good and they are more like song that were in other broadway show .
0	i love this song . the movie version is so much better . there is no point in listening to this .
0	this is a great song .
0	this is terrible . a bunch of young girl singing bohemian rhapsody in a very bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , very bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad , bad way .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	tom wait is the greatest singer . he is the best singer i have ever heard . i have heard all of his album . i have been a country fan for year . i feel like i just met tom wait . i love his music .
1	i like this song . it ha a lot of praise song .
0	i am a big fan of this song and i love the lyric . i hope you do too .
0	not my favorite , but i have heard it plenty of time and i have no problem with it . i would say , though , that this album is a bit of a ripoff of the first two-thirds of his first album . while the first two-thirds were not terribly bad , the third part wa .
1	wow ! the audio quality is excellent , with little to no distortion . i am amazed by the quality of these recording .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell these crap . i will not be purchasing anything until this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time you in need of help do not call the police !
0	lorde is just a really bad singer and the lyric fall short . her voice is not great , and i do not like the song .
0	this album is a good album . i like the song that are not worship song . the song are not a lot of variety , but they are not horrible either . the music is good . i will probably buy this album .
0	i really like your music .
0	i do not see how this is an album at all . there are no song from the point of view of a guy perspective . the music is very rock like with some acoustic guitar and a couple of synth track . i just do not see any difference between this and other rock album .
1	wow , this is a great song ! i will definitely be buying this cd . i love the fact that it is one of the few song that can be danced to .
1	this song is awesome . i like the music , but i like the lyric even more . for me this song is the perfect song to sing at church on sunday morning . i like the message that he is trying to get across . this is the song i would want to sing in front of everyone every sunday without fail .
1	this is a great song ! i like it . i would like to add that i have been married to a man for more than 20 year . i am a single mom of two and am currently out of work . my husband and i have been married for over 20 year and we have been together for 16 year . i love him very much and i have always had a great relationship with him . he is the best man i have ever met . but , i have been in a bad relationship for the past couple of year . i have been with a man for nearly 21 year . we have been together for 16 year . he is my best friend and i love him . he is everything to me and i am not sure what to do now . i have been through so much in my life and i just can not seem to get over him . i have been looking for love all my life and i just can not seem to get over him . there are time where i am happy and everything seems to be good- then he will do something to upset me and i just can not seem to get over him . i have tried so many time to make him understand why i am not with him and i just can not seem to get over him . i have had 2 abortion and i am still carrying a child inside of me . i have been drug free for the past 8 year and i am only using alcohol and recreational drug . i have never been in trouble with the law in my entire life . i have always been a good person . i have never been in trouble . i have never been in trouble with the law . i have been in trouble with the law once in my life- i wa arrested in 1993 for carrying a knife . i wa arrested and spent 1 day in jail . i wa only carrying a knife for protection . i have never had a weapon and i never hurt anyone . i have a record of 2 traffic violation in my life . i am very good at my job . i have a very happy family and i am loved by them . i have a very good personality and i am very active in my church . my family and i are very happy . my family and i are very happy . my family and i are very happy . my family and i are very happy . i have 2 child with my husband and i am very active in my church . i have a good job and i am very happy . my family and i are very happy . my love my husband . my love my husband . my love my husband . i would like

0	this is a great song . i love the lyric i love the beat i love the beat and the music . i love it and i would recommend to anyone who like old school hip hop music .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	this song is one of my all time favorite . it ha a great sing along chorus and i love the message of the song . i have it on my car and play it every summer . the message of the song is that god is always there and we can do anything we put our mind to . i have had the cd for a while and have never had it in my car . i do not know why i did not have it in my car . i do not know why i did not get it when i ordered it . i am not sure why i wa not notified when i ordered it . i am not sure why i wa not informed when the shipment wa going to arrive . i am not sure why i have not received it yet . i am not sure why it wa not sent to me .
0	this is just a very bad song .
1	i have bought a used copy of this cd and it play fine . it sound like the cd player is too loud - so i am going to buy a new one .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	the song on this cd are all really good . the quality of the cd is really good . this is a good cd , and it is a very good album . the song are all really good . they are all very well put together and everything is really good .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	i have been a fan of ohearn for many year , but this album is just not for me . i liked the first one , but i just do not see this being a full blown masterpiece . it is not even close , it is a good album , but not a great one .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsession with this song . he go crazy singing along when it is on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version is the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchasing the intended version ?
1	the word are powerful and true .
1	this song is about my wife and i. we have our own different way of dating . i think the song is so fun !
1	this is the most beautiful song i have heard in a long time on cd . it is probably my favorite song by her , and i love the sound of her voice . i like her voice on this album , but i think it is her voice more than the song . i love her singing on the secret life of walter mitty and i love her singing on rag doll . i liked her voice on you are the one that i want and i like her singing on you are the one that i want - i know , i know - i could be wrong , but i do not think so . this is the only cd that i can say that . i think her voice is her strongest on this album - and on the other song . this is the most beautiful song i have heard in a long time on disc .
0	this is definitely a wonderful recording . however , the sound is not a clear a i would like . the only other recording available ha the same problem .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	the cd is good , but it ha a few flaw . although it is a good cd .
0	i love playing this song in the car . it make me feel really good .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	my favorite version is the original version .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	this is not an album jewel released . this is a cd jewel put out to promote her new record ( i still have the cd in my room ) . the new song are great , and i like the new recording , but it wa not released a an album . the only redeeming feature of the new song is the song i am a bird ( which is on this cd , in the liner note ) .
1	just ordered this album .
0	i have listened to this album a few time now , and i like it . the song on this album are enjoyable , and i like the different style of music that they put on the cd . the musical style of this album varies from the first song to the last . it is very good , with a nice selection of song . i thought the selection for the lover concerto and carnival of light were good . it is a good album that i can get a lot of enjoyment from .
1	this album ha a great variety of song . i like the song on this album . i am not a fan of the song on the second album but the first album is worth listening to because it ha a great variety of song .
0	this one a little le interesting than the other tom wait song i have heard so far . i do not think it is anything to complain about , but maybe i wa expecting a little more , especially for such an original song .
1	i am glad that i bought this cd . it is one of the best album i ever listened to . it is very relaxing . you can really tell that the artist ha a lot of talent .
1	she ha a powerful voice and look good in a black top and jean .
0	i have this one on cd and it is one of my favorite track ever . this is a great song . the lyric are simple and beautiful . the music is beautiful . i have it on a cassette tape a well .
0	after buying this collection i had to listen to all the song . some are good and some are bad . i have to tell you the only good song is the one with elvis on it . the rest wa very good . i wish i had saved the money so i could have bought the entire collection . i would not have paid $ 120.00 for this collection . i would have been very disappointed .
1	i am a christian , i am a mother and i am a wife . my kid are my life . this song is my way of telling them that i love them . this song is all about loving each other .
0	i just bought this ! i like it . i like it a lot . i like it ! it is a song i have heard a hundred time and i just like it . i just bought this ! i like it . i like it ! it is a song i have heard hundred time and i just like it . i just bought this !
0	this song wa so bad it would be hard to even make it to the top 1000 song of all time . i wa not expecting much , but the first few note were good . then the guitar solo came in , and it all went downhill . it wa so bad that i could not even listen to it again .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	this song reminds me of the power of love . i like this song .
1	this song is amazing .
1	i love love this album , it is so great !
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	a great new british band . the sound is very unique , the sound is very modern and it is a very good band . the lead singer is very charismatic and his voice is really good . the instrumentation is very strong . if i am ever lucky enough to have the chance to see this band live , i will go . the band is very young , but with time they will grow a lot .
0	barbra streisand is a great artist .
1	wow . what an album ! what a collection of some of the greatest hymn ever written ! song of praise , praise , praise , praise . this album is great ! this album is great . i am a fan of worship music . i like this album . i like this album .
1	i have been a fan for over 30 year , and i have been waiting for a new album from the band after they stopped touring and working on the old album . i have been waiting for this album for a very long time . i am a fan that truly love the band , and i wa so excited when i found this album for them to release it on their new label . when i got this album , i wa excited . i loved it , and i wa looking forward to listening to it all the time . i wa also excited to find a song i had never heard before . this album ha all of the song i love from the band , and i love them all . i can not wait for the new album . i am a huge fan . this album is my favorite album in their entire career .
1	it is catchy and fun to dance to . it sound like it is very similar to the song that my son requested , so i thought i would download it . it is a good song that i am sure i will listen to the other song on the album .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . it is not often that an album is so complete . the cd is very well made and play well . very well worth the price . i have owned this album for a year and have listened to it a lot . i think this is the best album of his i have heard .
0	this is the best cd i have ever listened to . i have been waiting for it for a very long time now . i can not wait to get this cd .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i think the only reason i did not give this a positive review is because i feel that many of the song on here are not very well suited for worship . i think it is the fault of the writer . many of the song contain some of the most cliche lyric imaginable . i think that is the most disappointing thing about this album . i do not like the song on this album . i do not like the lyric on this album . i do not like the music on this album . i do not like the production on this album . i do not like the song on this album . this album is a little too overproduced for my taste . i do not like the song on this album . i do not know why this album is even put out . i do not like the song on this album . this album is awful . i am sorry to say this , but this album is awful .
1	is anyone else tired of this song ? i love this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it is the best song i have ever heard ! i like this song ! it is awesome . i love this song ! this is one of my favorite song . this is one of the best song i have ever heard . i love this song . this is one of the best song i have ever heard !
0	this cd wa one of the best i have ever purchased . it wa one of the first cd i ever purchased and i have since purchased about 20 more . it is one of the best cd we have ever purchased .
0	i like this cd . it is a very good cd . the sound quality is really good . it is just a standard cd , but the quality is great .
1	i received it and played it , and it turned out to really suck . i really liked the song , but i am very disappointed with it . it is a cd of a concert . it is a concert of the song my way by james brown . the concert wa for the artist james brown . the concert wa at the national shrine of the black madonna in cincinnati , usa . i have a friend who saw it and told me . i would have paid a lot more for this cd if it were on the original list of cd i ordered . i am not sure why i did not notice this . i would have paid a lot more to have this cd if it wa on the original list of cd i ordered . i am not sure what is going on . i ordered this cd and thought it wa the cd of all the song by the same artist . it is not . it is a concert of the song my way by the artist james brown . i do not remember ever buying this cd . i am not sure why it wa on the original list of cd i ordered . i would have paid a lot more for it if it were on the original list of cd i ordered . i think this is false advertising . i could be wrong
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	this is a real disappointment . i wanted a great cover cd with my favorite song , but i do not hear at all any of it . the only thing that wa worth listening to wa the very early pill and bible . also , the liner note are very bad , and the booklet is very old and very thin . i did like the lyric , but there is no meaning behind them .
1	this is a fun song ! it is not hard to sing along at all , and the voice acting is great . i would recommend this to everybody !
1	this song wa good . it ha a lot of thing to sing along to , but it is not long , so it wa good .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is an album of song recorded with a wide variety of singer over the year . some of the song are by dave clark five member , some of the song are by other singer , and some of the song are by singer who were not member of the dave clark five at the time . the song on this album are : the first noel you do something to you a time for you you do something to your baby you do you do a first night a time for you a time for you a time for you , part 2 a time for you , part 2 a first night i do something to you i do something to you i do something to you a time for you , part 2 the first noel sister sister sister sister

1	this is an amazing album . great album with good sound .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	love this cd .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is a cd i heard before , and liked it . it wa a cd i heard on the radio one time , so i like it . i really like the cover on this cd .

1	i just purchased this cd . it is a wonderful cd . i just ordered another one . i will be buying more .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	this song is very much like a cover of the bee gee song , money ( that is what i want ) it is not a good song , it is just annoying . i do not think i will buy this song . it wa a waste of money .
0	i like kiss more than anything else but it ha a very bad melody . i think it would be better sung by a male or female singer . the song start with an out-of-key guitar riff which is annoying . i do not know what it is trying to say , but it is just not good . i would give it a poor rating , but i am not sure how to rate it .
0	this is more of a conumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait this is a live recording of the first and nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert , perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very dis-concerting .
1	i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice because the song is the best song she ha done so far . i love the fact that she sings the song in her own voice in the best way , and i love the fact that she sings the song in her own . i like the fact that she sings the song in her own voice because she doe it in her own voice . i like the fact that she sings the story in her own voice because it is the best way to make the story and sing the story .
0	i have been listening to tom wait since i wa a young child . his song are always a treat to listen to and i have many cd of his music . it is also nice to hear someone who is not doing anything else singing his song ! i am thrilled that i found a cd of tom wait that is enjoyable to listen to . i wa very surprised to find out that he is an actor , which i never knew . he seems to be a very talented musician and i am happy that i have found a good cd . thank you for this wonderful gift !
1	i had not heard this song before and i love it . i think it is a wonderful song to sing , and i think that is because it is written in an honest way .
1	this band is so cool . they had the time of their life last night . they were amazing , and had an awesome time . they are so talented and have a great sound . this is my new favorite band .
1	i have not heard this album in a while , and i am glad to hear it . i do not agree with a lot of the opinion
0	i love the first song , it sound like a big band . however , it is really repetitive and i never get the feeling you are singing the same thing over and over . all the same feeling and harmony are great , but they are all so repetitive .

0	i love the cover version of this song . in fact , i love the whole song . bob
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	when i first heard this album , i wa in tear . i cried for an hour and a half . it wa soooo good . i loved everything about it , i loved the lyric , i loved the music , i loved the artwork and , i loved the cover art .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .

0	this one is awesome ! i have never seen it used in my show , but the crowd love it .
1	this is nice .
0	i am going to give this a 4 star review based on the review . the only negative i can think of is the cd is in mp3 format . i do have a window phone , but i do not know what it would sound like . i had heard great thing about this cd , but i am disappointed in the cd . this is a good cd , just not for me .

1	this is my all time favorite song .
0	this song is a little too fast and the lyric are a little corny . it is not the worst song on the album , but i think it is better suited to a movie than a single .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	great song and great musicianship . this is the 2nd time i have heard this song . the first wa in 1999. i wa disappointed with the guitar . i have to admit though , that it is a good song . the lyric are good . the only thing is that it is very hard to listen to it on the radio . it is not a weak song , but not a good song either .
0	this is the real deal . the music is amazing .
1	the most positive review of this release i have read . i like the music , but the vocal work is one of the low point of the album . i really hope the music will find an audience & the album will be more appreciated , but for now it is one of my least favorite . however , if you love the music , it will be a true winner .
0	i downloaded the song to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is simple .
0	these guy are just like the backstreet boy but without the harmony . i would like to see what they would sound like without the harmony . i think they would be a little more commercial .
1	tom scott ha some of the best music around and i like it all . he ha an incredible variety of music to choose from and i am looking forward to reading more from tom scott .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	great guitar album . i like this album .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !

1	i have many of her cd , and will continue to buy more . i am a huge fan of her music . she ha a beautiful voice , and i love her music . i have purchased a few of her cd , and they are in excellent quality , and i have played them many time . i really like the review on amazon , and i am positive that i will get them in good quality , and they will be delivered to my home in the future . i am a fan of linda thompson , and i will be buying more of her cd , and i will purchase more of her cd again , and i will continue to buy more of her cd .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	it would be easy to say that this album is about her relationship with her son , but it is more than just that . what i love most about this album is that it is about the relationship between two people . it is about the past , and how it is portrayed on the record . it is about the past and how memory are preserved in the song . this album is about the past and how memory are preserved in the song .
0	i just purchased this cd , and my husband is crazy about it . i wa looking for something that had a little more of a rock feel to it . he said it wa the best cd he had ever bought . it is so good . i wish i would have bought this sooner .
0	this wa an okay song , but i do not know why .
0	i have never ordered these cd and i also do not know why you wrote this review . this is the worst cd i have bought and i would just like to let you know that i have never ordered this kind of cd and i do not want to buy any more .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	great album . very positive song .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i have had this cd for over a year now . every time i listen to it , i am in awe and am surprised at how good it is . this is one of the best jazz album that i have heard in a long time . the band wa not great , but they made up for it with the music . it is a very good example of the music that come from the south . while it ha everything , this is the only version of this recording that i have ever heard that ha a saxophone by the great sax player of the 60 , curtis fuller . this version ha a lot of nice guitar playing that i enjoy . i also really like the bass playing . the bassist is better than his counterpart on the original version . and the trumpet player is great . there is also a great saxophone part in the background of the first half . the trumpet player is better than the original version . his trumpet part is the best in the entire recording . the saxophone player is a great choice and he is probably the best trumpet player in the entire recording .
0	she ha a very good voice , but the song are not very good .
0	i enjoyed her song . i have heard a lot of her song . the voice is amazing . i like some of the song she did in the old day . i like the cd she did with jerry .

0	i bought it because i like the cd but i do not know it is worth the money .
1	this is one of my favorite song .
0	i have come to love jewel music . she is one of few artist who can make me feel what i am feeling through her music . i have been a huge fan of hers since her first album , the best of jewel in 1989. this cd is a very good one , but it ha a few flaw . my biggest problem is the song the one to watch .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i wa looking for a cd to listen to at home . i bought this . i find myself listening to it . sometimes i get a kick out of it . but , it take a lot out of me listening to it a few time . for me , it sound like a made for tv movie . i do not know . i do not like this artist . i have not bought any of her cd . i do not know what to do about it .
1	i like this song . a very catchy and positive song . i like it very much .
1	i think that this cd is very good , i mean a lot of music on this cd , i love it a lot .
0	the song is good . i do like it , but i am not a big fan of mileys . it wasnt worth the price . i think i will play the song for my friend and see what they think .
1	this is one of the best cd i have ever listened to , so i would give it a 5 star if only the song were better .
1	this is one of my favorite album of all time . i love the arrangement . the music is great . the vocal are great . the musicianship is great . i never tire of listening to this album .
1	this is the only show i have listened to on the radio , and it wa very informative and interesting . they definitely have a point of view , and they put it out there in a way that get my attention .
1	the cd is great . i really like most of the song i have heard on it so far . i know they will be great .
0	this song wa like an over-the-top cover of a song from an old , forgotten band . i hate it .
1	this is my favorite miley cyrus song . the video is good .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	i love that video ! the song is great but the video is not very good . she wa acting way too much . i think it would have been better if she played a few different instrument and sung the song , like she did with wrecking ball .
1	i like this album a lot , the best of the bunch . i liked the ballad , the rock song , and the song that wa the least expected . i really like the song on this album , and i recommend this album . this is one of my favorite album .
1	i bought this for my sister because it wa her first album . she love it .
0	this song is a cover . i do not really pay attention to cover song . if the artist is good , i listen to them . if not , i do not .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i like some of the song , and i do not mind the vocal . i do not like it when singer repeat the chord or the same note over and over and over again . that is just annoying .
0	this is the first time in a long time that i have heard a cover of rock you like a hurricane . the instrumentals are good , but the vocal are not good . david lee roth is a talented singer , but this album doe not do it for me . i give this album a 3 star rating .
0	a great album by a talented band . the only reason i gave it a 2 star is because it wa one of the first cd i bought on cdbaby .
0	i love that song , but the video is horrible .
0	i do not think you can get any worse than this album . it is not the worst album by any mean , but when you put it up against the two other album off the album , this is the best . at the very least it is one of the worst album in the hammond catalog . i will give it a 6/10 , but i do not think this album is at all worth the price .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i love this album . very good .
1	this song is beautiful . i am a big fan of the pistol annie version . i love how the song is set to a great guitar riff and it is so very simple . i have always played this song and i know the piano version is beautiful .
1	i am an art lover and i always prefer to buy art from artist that are in my comfort zone . this artist is in my comfort zone . i love their art and i love the music . i will be buying the cd .
0	i wa looking for something to listen to when i wa getting home from work , and i found the perfect thing for that , this album .
1	this is an older song , and i like the track . i will go out on a limb and say that trouble is one of my favorite song ever . so , i am giving a thumb up .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	great selection of song and a great cd . i will be buying again .
0	this song is not bad . i wish i could play it on my phone .
1	this is a great and touching song .
1	i would like to say this is a good song , but i would like to know what song she is talking about , if it help . it is from a book by an author named kate dicamillo , it is about a woman who is a teacher at a school , her student have problem in school . when she is walking the campus , she is being stared at , and other boy in her class have feeling for her , so she is upset .
0	this is the best one for this time , but i think it is the only one worth the money .
0	this is the clean version . great sound and lyric .
1	i like this song . it is a very good song . i would like to see the album . thank you for this review .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i downloaded my entire cd collection . i listen to different music when i am driving to wherever i am going . if i am in a hurry , i will play the song on the cd player in the car .
1	if i could listen to just one song i do not remember what it wa , but it wa great , very good . i love her voice . i love her .
1	this is a great prince album . i like the beat of the song and the lyric .
1	i downloaded the lyric to a song because i wanted to show my girlfriend that i can sing .
1	i love the music of tom scott . he is a nice , talented artist . he is very talented and ha a unique sound . i recommend this album to all .
0	i really really liked this song , but i did not like it .
0	this cd ha some of my favorite song of all time . the vocal are great , the music is great , and the lyric are great . it ha some of the best lyric i have ever heard . the cd is very enjoyable and the song are great .
0	love the choir music and the whole idea of a hymn for a song . i am always a fan of hymn that end with a chorus .
0	i bought this cd because i wanted to hear the original version of the song that i loved so much in the 1970s . this version is just not the same . it is just not the same at all . this version doe not have any of the charm of the original . it is too much like a pop song and i do not like pop music . if you like this song , then you have to hear the original . it is just too different and i can not listen to a song that doe not sound like the original . i do not think it is any better than the original , just different .
0	it ha to be one of the worst jewel song ever . she ha the nerve to say she is doing a breakup song and still release it . i am sorry , but she is only hurting herself by doing this . jewel , in my opinion , ha no talent . you can not sell out and still have talent . your music is not good enough for people to buy your album . jewel , you are no beyonce . i wish you would just be satisfied with selling out and not have to do what you do . you are a great artist , but i do not think you should try to make money on this . you are doing it for the wrong reason .
1	this is a solid album . for me this is the best trance album i have ever heard . it is very good and very well produced .
0	this is a fun cover . i like the song and the movie version is better . it is more of a fun cover than anything else .
0	i really like this song . it is a really good song . but i do not think it is a great song .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	it is definitely better than the first one , and there are some song that are even better than the first one , but it still fails to stand on it own . the only redeeming quality are the song that were on the first one , i give it 5/10 . however , the biggest reason i gave it a negative is because it wa completely unplayable on the ipod .
1	i have just started listening to e.s.posthumus and i have to say that it is a very good recording . m.g .
0	i really like this album . the track are very good and the album is very good . i thought the album wa good , but the artwork wa not . i think it would have been better if the album had been released with the same artwork a the prince collection ep .
1	these two performance of beethoven 9th symphony are the best i have heard in a long time . the sound is wonderful , and
1	i have a great appreciation for jazz . jazz is my favorite style of music . this is a great album . dan
1	this is the first cd jewel ha ever released where she and her band do not play on her . i would have much rather seen her on her own , but i suppose that is the only way for her to do the song she want to do . i am not going to get rid of the cd just because she is not doing the song she wanted to do .
1	i love the dave clark five . i have been listening to this cd for month now , and i have to say that i love it . i have been listening since i wa a child , but i have only heard this cd in the last month or so . i love all the song , and the lyric are great . i have been listening to several dave clark five song off and on for some time now , and i have to say that the song themselves never fail to please me . it is the best band i have ever heard in my life . i would like to thank you for your cd . i hope you have a great day .

0	i bought these a gift for my friend . i think they are really cool .
1	this is what i think is the best music i have ever heard in my life .
0	i have been a fan of lareine since the day i first heard them . their music is extremely well produced and their instrumentation is top notch . i own all of their album and i am a huge fan of electronic music .
0	i love my laptop ( window phone ) !
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	one of the best song ever written and you would not change it for the world . this is my favorite song , and you would not change it for the world .

1	i like the song . it is a good song , i like sam sparro a well . she is a great singer , but i do not know what her name is .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	it is not a different , but the movie version is better .
0	my daughter thought the song wa cute and liked the melody . my daughter thought the song wa really good too . really happy to have this .
1	i like this album a lot better than i thought i would . most of the song are very good , with a couple being better than the first . you do not know me is one of my favorite on this album . the vocal do not sound too high for me to enjoy it , but the melody is good . a new kind of love
0	i believe the cd is a good record . i really like the way the song are written , the way it is arranged , and the way the vocal are done . i do not think this is a great record , but i am not going to give it a negative review .
1	this album feature a group of singer and instrumentalist singing and playing jazz piano . i am glad i found this album because the song are really nice .
1	i think this is one of the best rock song ever put on cd . i wa wondering in the past if this would be a classic . i have had it on my car for the last 2 year .
0	this is a good album that ha some good song on it . it is a good album for people who want to listen to a variety of style of worship . it is a good collection of song that is not too long .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i bought this album when it first came out . the first song i ever sang in public wa i wish i wa a mole in the ground . i have never been able to stand the way it sound now , and i am kind of sick of the whole thing .
1	i love this song . it is a really cool song to just listen to , but is really hard to dance to .
1	i listen to this cd over and over . i am not sure i could explain why . i think it might be my favorite song on the album .
1	when i wa about 10 year old , i used to go through phase of i am gon na buy this album until the day i bought this album , which is in the closet . i had a hard time finding the cd a i went through my teenage year but when i came across it at a flea market , i quickly grabbed them and have spent most of the past decade getting up to speed on the album and being familiar with them .
0	this is a really good song , and the guitar are incredible .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	i got this album in the mail today . i have a new found love for hard rock . some of the song on the album remind me of ac/dc . i guess i am not much of a fan of ac/dc , but i really like this album . i have bought several album by ac/dc , but this one is the best . good for any metal fan .
1	this is my favorite album .
1	i have purchased several of her other cd and they all have been great choice . i have enjoyed the music and the message .
1	this song is amazing . great choice of song for a relaxing night .
0	i like gay trance . i think it is the best album of the series .
1	this song wa fantastic . it is a real rock song , but it is not a rock song . it is a really good rock song . i like the way it start , and then the chorus , and then the outro . it is really good .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i love listening to this song , but i find it a little hard to sing in public . i will use it more when i am alone .
0	this album ha a special place in my heart . this album ha a special place in my heart .
0	i wa really looking forward to this album , and i wa even buying it online for my ipod . unfortunately i had to return it because i got a different version than the one i ordered . i guess i will buy it on itunes , where it should be a free download .
0	the song is so stupid , i can not even tell what it is about . the lyric are terrible . if you like anything by any of the band member , do not waste your time on this cd .
0	i am really sorry to say this but this album is a waste of time . i do not know why i even bothered .
0	i bought a david lee roth album on amazon . i did not know it wa a mess . now i am glad i bought it . it is not terrible . this is a great album . it is not great . it is just a mess .
0	do not know the dave clark five , but i like this song . i do not like the cover of this song , but i like the song . i like the dave clark five .
1	i love this song . it is the first time i have heard this song and i love how you can clearly hear the chord and the instrumentals . very good song !
0	i love every song on this cd . i love to listen to it and see the different people singing .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	i love this album . i have been waiting for it for year . i like it . it is great .
1	i have heard and liked this album . i have always liked jewel . i have always loved her music .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i really enjoy this cd so much , i would highly recommend it .
1	this is an excellent album . i have been listening to it for a few day now and i have to say this is one of the best i have heard .
1	i have never heard a music cd that ha such a strong and unique cover . i do not think i have ever seen one like it . but then again , my experience with this disc is limited . thanks for the cd .

1	i liked listening to the song on this cd . i really enjoyed listening to the song on this cd .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	well , it is the year of the dog , which is supposed to be some sort of seasonal cheer and celebration . the word are not exactly the most optimistic , but i can hear the sadness in the song and i like the music .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	she ha potential to be really good .
0	i have listened to this band song for a long time and i have always loved them . i have many album that feature their music . this is not one of them . this band is from the netherlands . it is great .

1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	this is an okay song . i enjoy the song , but the video is not the best .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i love tom wait . i own several cd by him . i have loved his music for year . i love his voice . i have listened to all his album . he is an amazing singer . he is my favorite singer .
1	this is a great cd . i love the song . i like it when there is a song that is all praise the lord . that is what i like about it . i like the song that are about worship . they are good for worship song . i like the song that do not really have a feel to them . they are upbeat , but they do not really have a wow factor . i think i will be buying this cd again .
1	i wa looking for a country cd to listen to while watching the game . i found this cd . i love it . the song are not a good a the others , but they work well with the game . i would recommend this cd to those who like country .
1	i like the tune and the chorus . the next one i will listen to .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i have seen this album for over 30 year and it is still getting better and better . not only do i love this album , but i also love the guy who made it . the song are catchy and the lyric are great . if you like the ramones , the stooge , the ramones , the stooge , if you like hard music , you will like this album . the only negative thing i can say about this album is the lyric are a little repetitive , and it is a little longer than it should be . if you like music that is a little different , this is for you .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	this song is not very good . i would like it more if the vocal were not so high . even after i turned all the vocal down it still became a bore . i do not know how the composer came up with this . it is just too much noise .
1	this is a cool cd . i like the variety of musician that are featured on this one cd .
1	this song wa a huge hit when i wa young . it is a great song and i love it . you can not really go wrong with a song like this .
0	i am not sure what this song is . i love the beatles but i do not know why some people feel like they need to sing this song . i do not understand this at all .
1	this is a wonderful collection of classical music from the great composer of to the 20th century . the sound quality on the cd is excellent . the song are well performed . i would recommend this cd to anyone who like classical music .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

1	a very good album
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	this track is an interesting one . the vocalist background sound like a classical singer i have heard before . the music is pretty good ( i did not know it wa a popular song , but it is ) . it is very sad music . if i had not already bought the cd , i would have ordered this one . it is a live performance , but they do have an acoustic version . it is a beautiful song , that will make you cry .
1	i love her music and her message . i like her music better than any other christian music . she ha been in my church for many year and ha been a blessing to the church .

1	this song wa not written for this album , but it fit perfectly . it is a song with a classic-sounding instrumentation that is easy to sing along with , and it is catchy . the lyric are easy to understand , and the song itself doe not sound like a cover song , but rather a traditional song . this song is a good song for any occasion .

0	this is a great album for those who do not mind a few pop song . the first song is the only pop song i know that is not a parody of some other pop song .

0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	if you enjoy listening to great song that are not necessarily country , this album is your kind of stuff . for example , i know where is a great song , i wish i could take losing you back is great , i wish i could take losing you back is a beautiful song , you are not alone is great , and you are not alone is great , and the rest of the song are great .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	a wonderful recording . i love this . the sound is great , but the sound is not clear . i have used many sound system , but i still prefer this one .
1	this song rock !
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i have no problem with other illuminati who wholeheartedly recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase from the beginning of the work and the ensuing development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team ’ s microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo – it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very centre of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action a few second ago wa .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	i have always loved the song my baby just a much a i have always loved whitney houston . it is a perfect song to end your day and just be happy that you are not the only one who ha a baby . i do not know about whitney , but to me whitney voice is just a good a barbra streisand . this is an amazing song and i am glad i have not listened to it too many time .
1	i am an artiste . i am not a singer . i can sing , i just can not sing well . this is my first album that i have written . i am not a singer anyway . i would never sing in public . i have never had a singing moment . i have always been a song writer first . i have never sung in a public setting . i wrote all of the song . the only thing i could do with it would be to upload it to youtube and post the video . i want to use the video a a marketing tool to promote my brand . i love the video .
1	this song ha a
0	i would highly recommend this compilation of ansermets recording . the sound is fantastic and the playing is excellent . the best thing is it is all here and not on a disc . the playing is excellent for the most part and the sound engineer made a few mistake that ruined my experience with the recording , but that can be expected with a compilation of the recording .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	it is good , but i like the first part . the second part is kind of annoying . but i like listening to it .

0	awol , it is a good song .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !

1	this is excellent . a great song .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .

1	some album are great , but this is one of them . i had heard the new hammond organ album , the hammond organ collection by the late , great , steve morse . it wa a nice listen , but it did not blow me away . the hammond organ collection is the sequel to a cd steve morse made that wa originally released in 1992. steve morse ha now been dead for two year , but his music life on , and not on the cd . steve morse wa a musician of great talent , and one of the best player in the history of the hammond organ . he made some beautiful recording , and this album is a must-have for any hammond fan . steve morse wa one of the greatest of all time . this album is one of my favorite thing i have ever heard and i have had my share of great musical experience . i hope this album inspires other hammond fan to seek out steve mors music . if you are a fan of his , this album is for you . i highly recommend it .

0	it wa just okay . not very good .
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	i enjoy the song . i like the song .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	this is my favorite song on the album . it is different , yet still represents the album perfectly . it is very melodic and very positive . i could not pick a favorite out of the whole album .
1	it is so sad how i can not stand awol nation , but i will buy their album and will rate it 5 star . my wife play the violin and ha written this song . she is an inspiration to me . i am still waiting to hear the rest of the album . allan bole
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	she can do it all .
1	i really really like this album , and i am really glad i got it . i wa really sad when i found out that david lee roth had passed away . i have been listening to his album since i have been a kid . i think this album is better than the first one because i like the production and i like david lee roth when he is singing . i think this is one of the best album of 2004. it is a great album .
1	this is soooooooo good ! my husband and i have been married for almost 30 year and we have never had a cd set like this ! the sound quality of the cd is excellent and the song are all so beautiful . we have been listening to this set for several day and we are still listening to it every night ! this is a set that you do not want to miss !

0	e.s.posthumus is a great album , but this album is a mess .
0	i have listened to this song for many year and it never get old . it is a good song , but i would prefer a version without the lyric .
1	she ha a beautiful tenor voice and her lyric are really catchy . i like the way she sings , especially when she sings i am a work in progress . i like her music a lot .
0	i love this album , but i have to say that i am a bit disappointed with the instrumentals . i am not into metal music , so i am a bit of a luddite . the best song on here are the instrumentals . there are a couple of good song , but the instrumentals are the best on here .
1	i bought an album jesus is all i need by joni mitchell and i like it very much .
1	i love this album and i have been waiting for it to come out for a long time . this album is such a great album with such a variety of song , but if i had to choose one i would choose the glory of love . i have listened to this album several time and it is amazing .
0	i loved this song . the message is very relatable . the chorus is nice . the lyric are very catchy , but it just doe not have that catchy kind of tune . i do not know , i just do not really like it .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	i love the song all together now and i need a hug . i am listening to this album right now , and i love it . i will be listening to it for a long time .
1	i hate to say it , but this is the only jewel cd i have listened to this year , and i love it . it is really , i mean really , really good . seriously , i do not think i have ever heard a cd that sound more like a good old fashioned pop , blue and rock type of sound . the guitar is like a rock guitar on steroid , the piano is a sweet a i have ever heard , and the vocal are perfect . it is my favorite cd of the year . my favorite among all her cd .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	this album is by far the best album of all time . if you love any punk band , you need to have this album . it is so much better then the other punk album i have . i grew up listening to this album , and i still listen to this album from time to time . this album is not only good , but it is also very good . i would definitely say this is one of the best punk album of all time .
1	i love daves clark five album .
1	this artist is a great entertainer . his song are catchy tune that you can sing along with . he is also a good singer and musician . this is a great album . however , it is a little repetitive . the first half of the album is a lot of great song . then another half is just filler . but , overall , this album is a great one .
0	i just finished listening to the dave clark five cd . i am a big dave clark five fan and have bought all the vinyl album . i am glad to see that dave clark is still playing music . it is a great collection and a lot of fun to listen to .
0	i like this album , i am a fan of the band , but i just think the song on the last album are better .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	this album wa not an album by prince at all . it is a remix album by prince . it is not a prince album . that is why i put it on here .
1	this song & video are awesome .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	it is just a few note from the piano . i do not know what the point of this is except to keep up with what i am doing now . i guess .
1	i love this album . it is a good mix of rock , reggae , punk and heavy metal .
1	i love this cd and i am so happy that you made it . i am not a huge fan of the traditional country music , but i am very happy to have discovered an artist who ha the gift of making me feel something from the moment i turn on her cd . this cd is something special and i am glad you made it .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	i have been a fan of mike varney since i wa 15. he wa such a great blue musician . it wa an honor to listen to his record . his voice is the best i have yet heard .
1	i love this very upbeat song . i thought it wa a good message .
0	i bought tom wait cd because i love song of this type . i have listened to the song on the cd and they are all good . i am a fan of tom wait so i got the cd . the song is good and the lyric are ok. i like the music but the sound is horrible . i do not know what kind of cd this is but it is way way too bad to purchase .
0	this is the first album i ever heard from skyworld . after a few spin , i have to admit i am happy with the cd . it is a solid trance album , very well produced . it is good for any time you want to dance .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	this cd is a wonderful collection of song , from the 20th century . a wonderful collection of song . each song a gem , and a treasure .
0	it is true what they say . if you do not like a certain song in your favorite band discography , then do not buy it . this should really be listed a i am not trying to be a prick , but i can not stand this song because i did not like it at all . i just did not like it at all . if i had written a review like that , i would be listed on the unpopular review list .
1	this song wa not sung a well a i expected . the song is fun and energetic .
1	i like this , but i do not like the guitar solo .
1	i am not a big fan of mike varney , but i really enjoy this album . the music is great , the voice is great , and the playing is good . this album wa released around the time that mike varney wa recording his first solo-album .
1	dave clark five - live :
0	i am usually not a fan of cover song , but this one is actually pretty good . i like the production and the melody and the vocal . the only thing i do not like about it is that it is not the original song . but i still like it . i would buy this cover over just about any other cover song .
0	i am very disappointed with this song . i think the song should have ended much earlier in the movie . the song is not my cup of tea .
1	this is a very nice cd that wa given to me by an old friend . i wa surprised when it wa played for the first time and i wa amazed when it wa played a second time . i must say that the sound quality on this cd is amazing . i have listened to it several time and it sound a good a it did the first time i listened to it . the only problem is that it can take quite a while to play . when i first started listening to it it took me about 2 hour to listen to all of the song on it . i have listened to it more time since then and i know that i have listened to it for about 2 hour and 20 minute and it still is playing . this is a great cd and should be highly in demand .
0	it is not the same song from the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original .
0	i like hearing this song . it reminds me of a cool , funky version of a tune by the rolling stone .
1	i got this song for my daughter . i think it is the best song on the album . i would recommend it to anyone , a far a i know .
0	i love this cd . it is a nice collection of song . some of the song , though , are just plain stupid to listen to . i like them , though . i would recommend this cd to anyone .
0	i like the original mix . i do not think the new remix wa a real improvement over the original . i do not care for the new remix . i guess it make no difference to me whether the new remix is better or worse than the original . i like the original mix .
0	i bought this album hoping to find worship song . i have only heard a few of the song and they are not my favorite . the song are not a well written a i would like . i would never buy this album again .
1	i think there are 3 type of music : those that are good , those that are great and those that are great but are good . i believe the best music is the best because it contains the best ingredient and you can find your own recipe to make it great .
0	this wa bad . it wa like a cover song .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i have a problem with this song . i do not understand why it is so popular . i did not know this until i saw it on youtube . it is not my type of song . there is really nothing to it . i think it is a terrible song .
0	this cd is worth the price , highly recommended for any fan of the dave clark five .
1	i have been listening to this album for the past day and a half . i love it . it is a great album , and it ha a lot of great song . it is a very good album .
0	i have listened to this album for so many year now , that i am not sure it still ha the same quality a the first time i listened to it . i do not know if it ha gotten better or worse , but it is not bad .
1	i really like the message behind this song .
0	this song suck . it is not even a half decent song . it is a cover of one of her song . and it just suck . i love the original song , but the cover make it sound like it is crap . it is just not good . the original song is better . the second time around is worse than the first . it is a shame because i think it could have been a good cover with someone who could sing better .
0	i bought her last album , and it is my favorite . i have been buying this for a year and a half , and i have loved it every time . i think she should keep the same style , but improve it a lot . i just do not understand why she started changing it up . i do not know if the album is good .
1	great cd , great artist . i hope to have a chance to listen to more .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	lareine is a very good singer and he ha a pretty good voice . his voice is pretty good because he ha this nice deep voice . he ha a good sound and the track is okay .
0	i did not love this album-far from it-but i liked the song and the band were good .
0	i think she sound better at the end of the song . i just can not get into it at the beginning of the song .

0	i love this record . it is great ! i like it a lot .
0	the last track the other woman is a great song all around . it ha some nice music bit to it for an oldie but goodie . however , the lyric are really terrible and i do not like it at all . it just leaf a bad taste in my mouth . i think it is better to listen to the song and ignore the lyric . otherwise , i would not have given this a 5 star rating .
1	i love and listen to this song all the time .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .

0	i am not sure if i am going through withdrawal from amazon music , or just because i stopped buying this garbage . i have several song from itunes that i have not played on spotify until recently .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this is one of their newer song . i think this is the best song on the tape . i do not like it . it is a dave clark five song . i do not know them .
0	this is a great record store . i think the best thing about this store is that people can buy their own cassette tape ! i bought my first record here , and i have been coming back ever since .

1	there is a song that you can listen to on youtube . it is a very good song . it is called somewhere out there . it ha 2 verse and 1 chorus . when you listen to the song , the chorus is very repetitive and the verse have too many line . i do not like it because the chorus is repetitive . the verse is good because it is shorter , the chorus is repetitive , and the bridge is good . i like the bridge a lot . the verse are good because they are short and the chorus is repetitive . also , the tempo of the chorus is slow . but the bridge is good . the verse have too many line , but it is not bad because it is short . the song ha very good lyric . it is good that you can listen to the song on youtube . however , you can not listen to it like this . you have to listen to it slow , and pause between each line . and the vocal sound good . i like the song . but you have to do it this way . it is not the way you should listen to it . i hope you will listen to the song again with this method . you should play it with the same method you play it now . because the sound is good and the tempo is slow . but the repetition is bad . and the word are repetitive . the reason i do not like the repetition is because the verse are short . i like the bridge a lot . it is short and the voice is nice . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . it is not like the song is played 2 billion time . it is only played once . i hope you listen to it again with like this . it sound good and you can hear the difference between the original song and the cover version . you should listen to the song with this method . it will sound better than the original . the reason i do not like the chorus is because it is repetitive . i hope you listen to the song again with this method . it will sound better than the original . also , you should listen to it with this method . it will sound better than the original . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . and the song is played 2 billion time . it is only played once if you listen to it with this method . it is not the same because the chorus is repetitive . this song is great , but you have to do it this way . the tempo is slow , and the repetition is bad . the reason i do not like the repetition is because the verse and the chorus are repetitive . it is not the same because the verse are small . i like the bridge because the verse is short . i like the chorus because they are short . also , the bridge is short . and the bridge is good . the chorus

0	i wa surprised at how much i enjoyed this album .
0	i like this album . i love this album , especially the first half . i like the second half too , but not a much a the first half .
0	the first three song of this album were a pleasant surprise , but a with many of my favorite song , the album itself end at the three and half minute mark . it is a shame that the recording wa over so quickly a it is a very good album . i had not heard this album before and it is very easy to listen to . i like the music on this cd . i like the lyric . i like the sound quality . i would like to hear more from this cd .
0	i really like this song and the video . i thought it wa quite unique and it wa really good .

0	this is a good song . nothing outstanding . i believe this is the second song on the album . it is a good song . nothing exceptional . the song is just average .
0	i guess the a in the rating is supposed to be a+ but i did not rate this a an a+ . this is a good album with a couple of great song and one that i did not like at all . i have found other album like this that i love , but i do not think this one is one of them .
0	this is annoying at time . i do not like the voice .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	she is a gifted singer . i like her singing .
0	i do not know what i am doing here . this is not my type of music . the songwriting is average . this is not my type of music . the songwriting is not really good . this is not my type of music . this is not my type of music .
0	i like him , he is young and fresh . like all of his song .
1	this is a brilliant recording with great music to listen to . the sound quality is perfect and the musician play very well together .
0	the only thing i would recommend is that they get her singing a little faster , it make the song seem much more dynamic .
1	i love that this song is so good . it is an excellent song .
1	i would buy this cd when it is released . i have seen this band play on the radio , and when i saw them on the radio i wa excited to get this cd . i would buy this cd when it is released . i have seen this band play on the radio , and when i wa in the area i decided to go see them play . i would buy this cd when it is released . i have seen this band play on the tv , and i have seen them on the radio . i would buy this cd when it is released . this cd is a very good one . i am glad i bought it . i like the music of this band , but it is not the type of music i would buy .

1	i think this is the best cover of this song i have ever heard . it is not a very good cover , but it is the best cover i have ever heard .
0	i have had this cd for about a month now and i have yet to open it and listen to it . i do not like the fact that the song are not the same on the cd that i have a compared to the cd that i am going to listen to . i will probably have to get a cd burner to listen to the song on a real cd player . i like the fact that they are all different and unique . i love this cd and will buy it again .
0	i wa disappointed with this cd . i expected it to be more than an average cd . it really did nothing for me .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i received one of these special 3cd package with a cd of the song on all 3 cd , and a dvd of a special performance of the song on all 3 cd . i love the song and it wa very exciting to get the package . i now have many friend in the u.k. and have bought many copy of the cd and dvd . i have the cd on cd and dvd . i have never heard a radio play this cd . so when i saw it come up on the radio earlier today i wa very excited . i have the cd on cd and dvd .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this is a great album . i like it
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	the song is great , the lyric are beautiful !
1	i heard this song on the radio and liked it . i wa able to listen to it on the way to work and i wa able to listen to it after i wa done working .
0	i think this is the best album by her so far . she is not the best singer , but she ha the best voice in the world .
1	this album is a must have for any reo speedwagon fan . this is a great album . i like the song , but the lyric sometimes get a little too much for me . i am not really a fan of the song , but i like the album .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	keith s wa a great guitarist , a great singer , and a good songwriter , and this album wa a re-recording of the same album . it is a decent album , but i would not buy it .
1	i have listened to this album about 15 time . i have enjoyed every one of the song . this is a great album . i love the oldie . i love the country music . i like it all .
1	great . the album is great . it is the best album of the year . great song writing , great guitar . i would say this album is better than the one by the eagle .
0	i wa never a big bonnie fan , but i heard a lot of her music on the radio and bought this album . i am glad that i did it because this album is a gem . if you are a fan of her music , this is not to be missed .
1	love this song .
0	i have taken a lot of flak for recommending this album . i really have to . i think it is fantastic . great music , great lyric and good arrangement . also , it is a great album for the fan of the band . i personally , am not a fan of the song , but i still like the band . good music , nice song , good arrangement .
0	i would like to give a positive rating for this album but it will have to remain a negative one because this album is so bad . the music is so bad that i feel that for the price of this album i would have purchased a cd of random song from the radio that wa on one of the many channel . this album ha so much potential and i would have bought it if i knew what it wa . this album is very similar to the temptation album in that the music is bad , the song are very short and are taken out of context . the only redeeming factor about this album is the name of the band . the name of the band is the prince collection and it is very clever since there are so many great prince song that have not been on any recording and are on this cd . the song in this cd are all very short and are taken out of context and are used in an attempt to sell this cd . this is a horrible album that ha a lot of potential and would be good if this wa the last cd that wa released .
0	this song wa good

1	great song , great acoustic guitar playing , and great vocal . the lyric are quite sweet .
1	this is my last album from this artist . i do not know what to think . i can not believe someone is giving him a 5 star rating . i have been a fan of this artist for year and the last cd i purchased wa a 5 star cd by this artist . i have always been a fan and will continue to be a fan . i have even purchased several of his cd .

1	i liked the title . it wa a catchy tune . the music is not very smooth . it is a little bit more subdued than the other tune in the cd . i like that . the vocal are also a little more subdued . i like the song from this cd . i do not like the others song from this cd . some of the others are not very special . i also liked that there are a lot of instrumentals in this cd . they were a little bit more interesting . i will listen to them all before i buy the other cd .
0	tom scott on the other hand is not a good a he once wa .
0	i have never heard a band that sound so unoriginal . the only reason i gave this album 4 star wa because they included a song from a previous release . other than that , i could not give this album a better rating . this band is overrated .
0	this song make me feel good . after listening to it a couple of time , i feel like i am finally on the right path .
0	this song ha a really nice message . it say do not cry , smile , it the best defense against tear .
1	i bought this collection on the recommendation of a friend . i wa pleasantly surprised . i thought that it would be a collection of random song but it is not and it is very beautiful and good .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	i really liked this song , i had never heard it and now i know why . i remember the song because it sounded like the beatles and i love them . i also like this song because the chorus is so good and you can have a complete song by singing the first two line together . i think this would have been a good song if the second half of the song wa sung by someone else . i do not know what i would change to make this a better song , but the song wa fine .
0	i bought this album just to listen to it . i think i wa a little disappointed . i guess i wa expecting more from this band . i wa very disappointed . i have bought their album from this compilation before , and i love them , but i will not be buying this one . i will stick with their other album . i am glad that i bought this one though . i feel that it wa worth the money . i think it is a nice compilation of some of their better song . i really like the band , i think they can be very good .
1	i know he wa in the house band , but i do not think he is a good singer . this is not a very good song . i do not
1	i love the chorus to this song . i can not get enough of it .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i love this song ! it is my favorite ! the other song are ok , but this is my favorite .
0	i love this band . this album is what put this band on the map .

1	a collection of the best song and performance from the career of the legendary songwriter and producer , alan price . the collection cover his work on the beatles , genesis , rod stewart , dire strait and others . in a word , it is an encyclopedia of great music .
0	a a fan of ohearns from the 80 i am extremely disappointed with this recording . i love his music and i always have . i have listened to this album from beginning to end and the song are all very good . this album will be a hit with me because it is his best work and it is the only cd i own of his that i have not been disappointed in .

0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .

0	this is a very old album . it doe not sound that old . the song sound fresh . if you are a church music fan , this one might be right up your alley .
0	the end of barbras part is really irritating . it is like someone is trying to make an awful joke out of their last ever show .
0	this cd is not worth listening to . it sound like a demo tape or a poor quality recording . the vocal are okay , but the bass sound very bad . and the other instrument sounded good , but the bass drowned everything out . the only thing that stood out wa that the drummer did a great job on the bass drum . and i wa actually impressed . the bass is not what make the record bad . the main bad thing is that i can not figure out what song this is . i have no idea what instrumentation this is , but there are a few instrument that all sound the same . but there are no vocal . and the song is very short . i think it is a great song , but i can not figure out what it is . if there wa a bassline , maybe it would have been better . but there wa nothing .
1	this song is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . this is a good choice . this is a good choice . i like this song . i like this song . it is a good choice . it is a good choice i like this song . it is a good choice . it is a good choice . it is good . it is a good choice . this is a good choice

1	this is an excellent album . i just got this album from amazon and have been listening to it for the past few day . it is very good . i have not heard anything like this before . i would compare it to a good mix of music from different genre . it all fit together really well . it is a great album to listen to .

0	this song ha a great beat , and it is got the right kind of dance and groove that would be good for the show .
1	the song do not say goodbye is very catchy
0	this is an odd piece . to me , it doe not seem to have the same feel a other piece like bolero or gloria . it all feel very . modern . it ha a very clean and jazzy feel to it which is a good thing but it certainly doe not come off a classical in any way . it just is not anything i will listen to often .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	this album wa a really good album for my collection .
0	the beatles are amazing , but the album is terrible .
0	very well done song !

1	i wa expecting a bunch of song that are not very familiar to me and i get a dozen . i do not know how i did not make this a 4 star rating . i have not listened to this album in awhile and it is great . i hope that it is an annual tradition for me to get this album and i will be very happy with it .

0	this is very boring and stupid .
1	this is my all time favorite song.it is a beautiful rendition of a traditional , and it ha such a great feel to it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	this song is great . it is a funny song .
0	this is from the man who sang the boy is mine . the lyric are from his father- he doe not seem to be a very good father . when he finally did come home after a very long time , he came home with a bottle of whiskey and told my husband and i he wa sorry for breaking up with the kid , but he could not stop thinking about them . he wa sorry . we did not drink or take his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long time . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about the kid . we did not drink , but we did not stop his whiskey . the next sunday he came home again after a long while . he told u he wa sorry and that he wa thinking about u . we again did not drink or drink his whiskey . he wa a very nice person who we did not want to do harm to . we did not want to do harm to him either .
0	this song is great , but the songwriting of this song is boring . there are no word and very little melody . and i have to wonder if this song wa made for someone i know or someone i do not know .
1	i love the album . it is too bad i am not a big fan of the band . the album is very good , but i just do not like them . it is not their best and it is not their worst album , but it is their best album . i enjoy listening to it when i am driving on my way home from work and i do not have time to listen to my music . i appreciate the musicianship and the quality of the production , but i do not love the band . to be honest , i just do not like them . there are good song on this album , and they are very good , but they are not the best .
1	it is the second best on the album . it is a little on the simple side , but it is catchy and fun to sing along with . i really hope it get some play on the radio or somewhere .
0	i want to thank the boston symphony orchestra for having the courage to record the chicago symphony orchestra . i like that they recorded a good recording of the chicago symphony orchestra . i have just ordered the chicago symphony orchestra - the boston symphony orchestra cd .
1	i have listened to this cd several time now . the song are well performed and the album is well put together . i have yet to hear a bad song on the cd .

0	this wa a great album , but i did not like any of the track . i liked the variety in the track , though . overall , it wa fun to listen to and overall a good album . i thought the production quality wa okay , but not that great .
1	this is a great album , with great song and production . i have been listening to this album for about a year now and i love all of his best song . you could listen to this album on your own and enjoy it . i would say if you are not a fan of this artist go out and buy one of his other album .
0	the music is good and there is a lot of good song , but most of the track are a bit boring . the lyric are really good but the music is too dopey to be catchy .
1	the lyric are so beautiful and the music is very good . the only complaint is that the album is very hard to put on and take off .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i love listening to these song . i used to love listening to this song a a child . it is my favorite song .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .

0	this is one of the best live album i have ever heard . i like the song on this album . it is very long and it really is a great live album . it really show u what the band wa up to . the band sound great and the sound quality is great .
1	this song is great . i like the way the song is structured and the lyric are sung . it make me feel different than i would normally feel which is very cool . the only thing i do not like about this song is the ending of the song . although i can understand the ending , it is not a very good one . i think it would be a better one if the song had more vocal or the song ended with a different idea .
0	this song just doe not do it for me .
1	what a voice ! i think this is allan bole best album . the song are very emotional and well written . the only thing i do not really like is that the end of the song always cut out . i am giving him 4 star . allan bole is an amazingly talented musician .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i have liked this song from start to finish . i love r.kelly and this song is the best .
0	this song wa not given a rating because of the video . the video is boring and doe not fit the song .

0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
1	a nice clean version
1	this is one of the best trance / trance-y album of the year , and it ha a lot of good trance track . it is easy to listen to , but it doe have a repetitive feel to the track . the album is well put together and ha a lot of good trance track , but it doe have a repetitive feel to the track .

0	just wanted to let you know that this cd wa a waste of money . it wa horrible to listen to .
1	the recording of the beethoven fifth symphony is truly exceptional . the quality is excellent , and the performance is also superb . it is really hard to describe the quality of this recording . the sound is very clear and very detailed . the music is just outstanding . a good recording of this piece would be hard to find . this is the best i have heard .
1	a hard rock song with great guitar playing . a great voice . this is what i am looking for in a new band .
0	not my kind of music . i am sorry but it is not my idea of a good time . it is not an album that i would listen to when i am alone in a dark room with a good book . it is too loud , too much bass , and frankly too boring . i just do not like it . and it is not all that good . in fact , a a whole , it is just a bad album . i would recommend it only to a complete beginner who really want to get to know a band they are going to like . and then to a person who would like to just get to know tom wait anyway . it is a nice album , i guess . and that is why i did not review it . this is not a review of a band . it is a review of an album . and this is an album , not a band .
0	i really like this song . it reminds me of my mother singing along to a song .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i have seen this song on several occasion and it is always a favorite of mine . i love it , but i hate how it doe not appear to have any lyric ! ( the video doe have a little bit of the lyric , but even with the little bit of info , it would still be nice to have the lyric in the song itself . )

0	i wa listening to song from her new album and i fell in love with her voice . i really liked the song just a touch but i wa a bit disappointed by the other song . some of the song just did not have much to do with the rest of the album . this is an album i will listen to again . it wa good , but i do not think she will ever top this .
0	this is a very good cd . it would have been a great cd , but there is just not enough of the cd to make it great . there are so many track that are just filler , that it is hard to tell the better from the worse track . a great cd for the price , but you can not beat the value for the amount of track you get . all of the song are in good quality .
1	this is his best song and i can not get enough of it .

0	i have never liked any of the earlier hammond album , but i have listened to this one a lot and enjoy it . i would prefer if some of the song had le repetition , perhaps a little more variation . i would like to know more about the music and lyric . i have found this to be the most interesting of all their record . i think i would rather have the best song than the best production . i agree with the other reviewer on this one .
0	love the singing , but overall a little too fast .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	i love jon lord . i love dave clark five .
1	a collection of some of the more well known song from the legendary rock group : the beatles . many of the song on this compilation demonstrate the range of their musical ability from the easy rocker , to the more challenging and atmospheric song .
1	this song make me cry .
1	this song wa a blessing to me .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this is a great song . the lyric are great and the melody is beautiful . i would have listened to this song if only i had a recording of elvis singing it . i have been trying for year to purchase a copy of this album and i have not had any luck . i would enjoy this album much more if it had elvis voice singing it . i have tried to purchase this album from the itunes store but i can not find it . i am trying to find it on amazon but i can not find it . i would love to purchase this album and have someone from itunes or amazon send me a copy .

1	they play a great song everytime they play it !
0	i think this album is good , but the song on this album are a bit repetitive . i also think the production of the album is a bit sub-par .
0	the only other good song on the cd is santa baby . i like the other song , but i do not like this one .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	this is the first cd i have ever bought from cdnow , and i am disappointed in the song selection . i have never heard the song that were on this cd . i am not expecting anything , but i would at least have a better song selection than this cd ha .
0	i love all of the music on this cd , but i will be honest and say that i do not love the vocal of this cd . yes , they sound great , but the singing is just very off putting . it is almost a if the singer is singing through a tube , or being played by a machine . i can not wait to hear what is on the next cd . i love the variety of artist on this cd , but the vocal of this one just make me cringe . i do not know if i will buy this cd again , but i will be listening to it a lot .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .

0	i have heard keith on this cd and i love his voice . he is a great singer . he is a great guitar player . he is a great musician , too . the song are all very nice . the only thing i can not stand are the song that are played over and over again . they are very repetitive . i just can not stand that . they have good song , but , they are boring . i mean , these are just song . just like the song on the radio . i mean , they are just song . i like them . they are not bad . i just like them better when they are played on the radio . i like the radio station better ! but , i prefer the song played on the radio better ! the cd is really good . there are a lot of nice song . i like that . there are a lot of good song . that is why i bought this cd . the only bad thing about this cd is the song that are played over and over again . that is it , i just can not stand that . i just do not like that at all . they have good song . they are not bad . i just do not like that they are played over and over again . but , i think that is their problem .

0	i am a huge fan of elvis , and i wa extremely excited to listen to this album . however , i wa disappointed to find that it wa not the elvis album . it wa only a compilation of song from other elvis album . but that is okay because i love them all !
0	i have been a fan of reo speedwagon since the mid-seventies , and have been a big fan of the band since their early day . this is the first time i have bought a complete reo speedwagon album , and i feel that it is very well put together . i love the intro , and the lyric are fun and humorous . the song are well written and the vocal do justice to the song . the only complaint i have is that not many of the song are included . i would like to hear this album with a few outtake .
1	this is a very nice cd , i like the lyric of the song . i like the way this is played .
0	this song ha a good beat to it and some catchy word . i like it .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i just do not like this album .
0	if you think that you do not like tom wait , then you have not heard him live . this is the first tom wait album i have had . it is more like a live recording than an album and is a very good live album . it wa recorded at a live concert . the sound quality is superb but i do not have the cd player to listen to it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i can not imagine what ohearn is doing right now , he ha a way of making older song sound fresh and new and he ha a way of making newer song sound pretty much like they were written today . he doe not take himself too seriously and he doe not try to make his music sound like anything else . i think he is right up there with the best of them all .
1	this is a great album . i am glad this one doe not have the dance track . it is all very happy and peaceful .
1	this is one of the best prince album ever . i love it . i love the sound of it . it is excellent .

1	this is the most inspirational album i have ever heard . i am a christian and i am very thankful that i have found this album .
1	jon lord and his band are a great band , and this is a great album .
0	i have been singing this for year and i love it . it is a fun song to sing with my daughter . this song brings back memory of when i wa a kid and we would sing this song .
0	i like the song and the video , but the song and video were not a good a i thought they were . i thought that the first part of the song wa ok and then after that it just fell flat . the second part of the song wa very good and then after that it just fell
0	not the best song , but a good one .
1	i am a huge lorde fan . i just bought this cd to listen to this , but i am in love with it . i also bought a box of the other cd to listen to this cd and it is even better . it is like a perfect mix of the two . i will buy this cd in a heartbeat .
1	this is a great song , and the sound quality is great . when you listen to this song over and over again , you will not know what version you are hearing . however , the clean version is not a good , so buy the clean version .
1	i have been listening to sam sparros demo on his website for a few month now . i like the song . it is not one of my favorite , but i just like the song . i wish he would sing more song , and not so many of the same one he is already sung .

0	i bought this cd at the recommendation of a friend . the price wa good , but the music wa good . i will definitely buy the cd again !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i love this album . this is one of my all-time favorite album . my favorite song are all on this album . and my favorite album are all on this one . so , yes , this album is amazing . i love the mix of rock and folk , both in the song and the arrangement . and i love the new song , and the music video for the new song is a new favorite . this album is still very good , though , and i have a number of other album that are even better .
0	this song really is a great song , but the chord are really off .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	i love the music on this station .
0	that is a nice little song . it is very good .
1	if you want a song that is very different from the trance stuff , like dubstep and idm , this is it . the song have a humble vibe to them and are very melodic , yet still different . i think this is a must have for any dancefloor .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	a good song , it is more interesting than the movie version
1	this is an up-beat song that is great to sing at wedding and christening .
0	this song is a good one . i like this version a lot .
1	i had the pleasure of having this new cd in my collection a few week ago . i really love it . i bought it because it wa on sale . it is a good cd with a mix of contemporary and old-school song . it ha great lyric and great melody . i really like the song that are about worship . they are good for worship music . i like the song that are slow and quiet , but they do not have the wow factor . i really like the song that are upbeat , but they do not stand out a much . i guess that is just the way it go . i think this cd is good , but i think i will buy it again .
1	i have been looking for a tape like this for year . i have found it . i love it . i just wish i had more to say .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	if i knew this song wa going to be so popular , i would have gotten the cd when i wa buying my first cd player .
1	karajans recording of the world is waiting for the sunrise is a very rare and exquisite piece of music . i love this recording . it is one of the best recording i have ever heard .
1	this is just a great song . i have been listening to
0	my favorite bonnie raitt album . i love that she still doe what she love to do .
0	i thought this song wa pretty good until i heard this . i wa like , what the hell is this ? i think that is my favorite song on the album ! then i heard this shit . it is worse than what we are hearing from the grateful dead . it is terrible . i wa going to buy this off of amazon but i threw it on my ipod instead . i hope amazon doe not get sued for this one . i do not want to get sued . i have a lot of money invested in this company . this is what i am talking about . i wish that i had never bought it . i hate this version . i hope that amazon take the appropriate action . i hate this version a much a i hate the grateful dead .
1	the song make me cry . it make me cry . it tear me up . this is a great song .
1	i wa in a bad place when i first heard this album . i wa depressed , and with no direction in life , i turned to drug and alcohol . i also used to listen to a lot of classic rock , so i put on all my life and all my life to drown out the noise .
1	the best trance album of the year so far , and if anything , it is better than the last one , which is really a shame a it wa one of the best trance album ever made .
0	i have a very strong personal dislike for this song . the lyric are pretty stupid , and the melody is just too jangly . so i can not really blame the song on it is own . i just wish it wa more like the original .
1	i do not know why this album is so unpopular . it is very good . i agree with other review . i think the band is a little too similar to the last album and i do not like that at all . i do think the band is a little better at playing live than at recording . there are several song i like , especially the title track , a little too late , and the house that jack built . i do not know why this album is so unpopular ; it is very good . i enjoyed the last album , but i am not a pleased with this one . it is not perfect , but it is good .
0	i am totally in love with the music in this show . it is amazing , i wish everyone would see it . the movie is even better .
1	this man ha a gift . it is like he ha been written right in the bible and a voice ha been written in his soul that say come on you have to sing the old song and play the new song and it is just a matter of time before he get the blessing .
0	oh i am telling you , this album is great
0	i have been a fan of gnr since their first single in the late 80 . i have bought their album since then , and this cover is amazing . i do not care for the original cover .
1	i bought a cd player for my husband for christmas . he had been asking for a cd player for several year , and wa getting tired of his portable cd player . i told him that i would be the one to deliver the gift . i got one for him , and it wa a great gift . he is very happy with it .
1	i have always liked this album , it is a great selection for your trance collection . i really like when a band get a chance to mix up their style . they really do a great job with this album .
0	awolnation is a really fun and short song . i love the melody and everything . i hope this album is good .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this is the only song on this tape that i really enjoy .
1	love this song it sound like the wave at the beach and it is very relaxing .
1	i found myself thinking about this album when i went to sleep and listening to it in the morning . i am glad i bought this one , too . it is a great album .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	this is one of the worst song i have ever heard . i hate it . it is painful to listen to , and it doe not have any redeeming quality .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	i like this song .
0	what ever happend to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it seems she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	very nice album ! i bought the old one . love the new one .
0	she is not a bad singer , she just ha no voice and no style . what is the point of this song ? it is a waste of time , i am not going to buy it .
0	i like it very much .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this song doe make me cry every time i hear it !
1	i have just listen to this album for 2 hour now and i really like it . thealbum ha a lot of good song and the song have a lot of good melodic structure . the song are very well made and the song structure is also very well made . the album is very good and the quality of the music is very good .
0	i like this version of this song . the new version is not that good .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i feel this album will forever hold a special place in my heart . the first time i heard it i felt so bad for the people who do not know about this band . this album wa the first time i truly understood what the band wa about and i have listened to it over and over . ( i still like the other album too . ) i love the vocal especially on lollipop and the acoustic version of mountain song . i would like to add that i wa a fan of them in high school .
1	i really like this album . i do not know who the author of this song is , but the music is really good , i would even say it is a nice addition to the soundtrack of the godfather
0	i bought it to share with my friend . it is ok. but i would not buy again .
1	rise up is a song about fighting for your right . it is an empowering song . it is empowering for a young girl like her . i think she is so sweet and lovable , she doe not deserve to sing about her ex-husband - i think she doe deserve to sing that song . i am sure she will sing it again and again . it is a special song and it will make you feel better .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i am not sure what to make of this album . i wa not a fan of the band when i first heard them in the late eighty , but i have grown to love them , and i would like to hear more song like you do not know me . i have got the cd , but i do not know how to play the guitar . my dad taught me how to play , but his guitar wasnt very good , so i am not sure if i can play this cd . i really like the album , but it is just not a great one .

1	i wa looking for a pop album to listen to while i wa out working and this wa the first one i found . it is all about the vocal and the arrangement . it is got so many song that i do not know where to start . it is like i am listening to a whole album of song on one cd , but i have never heard so many song on one album before !
1	i really liked this album . the song are very good and well written . i enjoyed most of the song very much . i am glad i bought the album .

0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	the music is very good . the harmony and arrangement are very good . this is a very good cd . i love the song and the harmony and the arrangement . the arrangement are good .
1	i received this cd , which wa sent to me by my friend , who had purchased it from amazon . it is not a cd that i thought i would receive . i am not the type of person to get a cd on a random night - so i did not get a cd . i wa surprised , though , that i wa the only person who got the cd and i wa just a surprised that it wa a beautiful , well-crafted piece of music . i did not know about the secret song that the album mention , but i am glad i did find out because i wa looking forward to hearing something new . i have heard several comment about the song that is on the cd and i am very glad i did not get a copy of that song . the song that wa on the cd is , however , a beautifully composed piece of music and i am glad that others will be hearing it and maybe even singing it with me one day . i can not say that i will buy the cd from this source again , but i will keep this cd for my own enjoyment if i ever need a similar piece of music .

0	a great cd . i like the song , the production is excellent , and the cd is just a great deal .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	i have to laugh at the first time i saw the name of the artist on the title of this album . it is the name of my favorite comedian , but i never heard of him until i read the name of this album . i am so glad that i did . it is the most fun i have had in a long time .
1	this is an excellent and well-recorded collection containing the complete recording of the music of george gershwin . i love this collection , and would recommend it to all those who have their own music collection .
1	i wa really excited to listen to this album . i thought that it would be more in the pop-art rock feel , but it is in fact more in the 80 punk rock feel . i love the lyric , and some of the song are very good song . the first song i listened to wa t.s.o.l .. the song is by far my favorite song from this album , and i have been listening to it when i am out with my friend , to the point that i have now memorized the lyric to it . it is a very good song . the album is a great example of the 1980s punk rock , which is why i give it 4 star .
0	i think this album is a great one . it ha a lot of song and i really like the one i have heard so far . i would recommend this album to people who like a great variety of music .

1	this is a really good cd . i love the music . it is very nice and i feel like i get a lot of enjoyment from the album . the song are very well presented , and the sound quality is good . i think this is a fine collection of song .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i like the music on this album . i think it is quite nice . the backing track is a bit too much .
1	a wonderful piece of art .
0	i like the song , but i do not think it is a good song . it is just bad . i do not know how people are putting this album on repeat . this is a very well produced album . i think it is a shame that i do not think the album is good . the album is good but it is not amazing .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	this is the second time i have heard it , and i love the song .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i am extremely disappointed that i did not get a chance to hear this album until now . i love reo speedwagon so much , so i am very disappointed that i did not get to listen to this album until now . i wa really looking forward to listening to it . i can not believe i did not get to hear this album until now . i do not think i would ever consider buying this album again .
1	the first song is a re-recording of hey jude . the second song is a re-recording of sylvia . sylvia is the only song on the album that wa recorded with harmony vocal accompaniment . the third song is a re-recording of i feel fine . i feel fine is the only song on the album that wa recorded with harmony vocal backing . the last song is a re-recording of good night . the vocal on this song are really nice . they are not too clear or too strong .

0	i bought this album . i think that it is a really good album . i like the way it sound .
1	i really enjoyed this album . it wa great to listen to . i would recommend this album to all people who like the beach boy , especially to people who like the first album .
0	i thought this wa a great album . i agree with the comment , there is nothing on here worth listening to . i tried to pick some favorite and the selection were all so far removed from each other , i could not make a judgement of any of the song until i heard them all . i did however pick up the end of the world is nigh which i had not heard before .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i like it , but i wonder why this version is not in store .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	i really want to like this band . i like

1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	when i think of the dave clark five i think of the song tiger moon from the best of the best and then i think of i am beginning to see the light . the dave clark five is a good group with a few great song . i hope that they continue to record and release new music .
0	i do not know why i like miley . but i do . i think she is awesome and i think she is so talented .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .

0	i do not understand this tape . if it is supposed to be a classical/rock album , then it is no different from other album . the vocal , the instrumentation , the arrangement and the music are very different to each other . i do not know which is which . it just baffle me .
1	this is great trance album . this album is great music . the quality is great . the mixing is amazing . the song choice are diverse and the song are great . i think this is one of the best trance album that have been released in a long time . this is one of the best trance album i have ever heard . i recommend this album to everyone .

0	i love this album , but i do have to say that i have found a lot of song to be too slow . it is definately some of the slowest i have ever heard . it is not a problem , but i will have to listen to alot of it . this is an old album , and i am hoping that i can find someone new on youtube to do a better job with this album . i have been very suprised at the quality of the song . but it still is a good album .

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i hate to give a review for a cd at this point . i have not listened to it yet . the one song that would make me return it is tear by this artist . it is one of my favorite .
1	there are so many good song on this album , but i think some may not be my cup of tea . still a great listen though . i am a huge fan of her music !
1	this album should be on the must-have list for every fan of oldie . the album start with the a christmas fanfare which is followed by i will be home for christmas which is followed by god rest ye merry gentleman . the album then go into another medley of here come santa claus and jingle bell . the album end with the aul lang syne .

0	i like beckys version . i think that this song is better than the one on the cd but i will not be purchasing the cd . i do not want to buy a cd that i will not enjoy . i like the original gnr song , but i do not think it is a good a this version .

0	a terrible , terrible version of this song - i have to use the computer to listen to it . it is a bit slow and there is no rocking at the start and end of each verse , which is what make it even worse . and the opening riff sound like someone ha gone to the studio with a piece of wood and beat that up to sound like this .

1	great voice to start with . but the voice get worse a the cd wear on . still , i enjoyed listening to it .

1	i love this music . i bought it for my son . it ha a great beat and the lyric to the song are so cute .
0	i think it is a good album .
1	sam sparro , i had not heard before today . this is a great tune , i like sam sparro a well .
0	for the rest of my life i will play this song . i wa born in 1977. i have been singing this song since i wa about 1 year old . i love it so much . it wa one of the first song i learned and i still love it . it is one of my favorite .
0	it is a good song , but it is just not one of my favorite .
0	i am not a country fan , but i do like listening to country music . i thought this wa a cool song and will listen to it again .
1	this album is a mixture of great song that i do not think anyone would have heard before . the song are very enjoyable and i enjoyed listening to them .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i am a long-time fan of jewel and have been since the 80 . i am a big fan of her earlier album ( gim me shelter , the black album , and the love song ) and feel her to be a great singer and songwriter . the new album is different from all her other album in that it ha a more upbeat feel . it is a great album and i am looking forward to her next album a well . i have had the jewel cd for year and have been a fan of it . i wa upset when i heard they would not be releasing an album with her . i wa really upset and am glad i got my cd back so i can listen to it again . i love this album and hope she will record another one .
0	her voice is great when singing along to the song , but it get monotonous .
0	this ha to be the worst album ever made . it is awful . it is bad . you have to buy it . it is not even worth buying .
0	i am really surprised that someone a talented a miley cyrus would waste this much time on a video . it is a good song , but it is just a wasted effort .
0	i am a new listener to this music . i have not had too much of this music before . so , i am really excited to listen and hear what this band can do . i am a fan of electronic music in general .
0	i love it . the music is great and the lyric are funny .
0	wow ! it is a beautiful recording .
0	the lyric are all over the place and the music is awful . i do not know what happened to this band , or their talent . the vocal are atrocious and the song is horrible .
0	this song is very good . i like the song . the only thing i do not like is the very long lyric . i wish there wa a shorter version of the song with the lyric cut down .
1	i used to love listening to the dave clark five . now i listen to them only on their album and with people who do not mind . i would love to be able to listen to their cd without the annoying part they play . robert
1	the song is good , it ha a great melody and also , the chorus is very catchy . i like it , it is a good song .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	this is my favorite of the year . this is my favorite of the year .
0	this band is not my favorite . they are not a good a the last album . i am glad they are still performing , but i do not think they will be performing in the near future .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	i am a fan of hammond and enjoy his work . i really like this album . i think it is the best one he ha released in a while . i also think the album is too long . i would cut it down .
0	i bought this cd because i thought it wa going to a different place . instead , it is just a rehash of the same song . i am a fan of jewel , but i am not a fan of this type of pop music . this cd is overrated .
1	i just found this cd on the internet and i have been very happy with it .
0	i have listened to this album several time and i always listen to the album in order . i love the album , and i hope you like it a well .
1	the first time i heard her song i wa blown away . i wa at a party and it wa just a short amount of time before the song ended . now my ear are still ringing . i love the way she sings the song .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	one of the greatest song ever recorded .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	this is amazing . this is an excellent album that i can listen to while i am making dinner .
0	this album is awesome , i love the song and the music is just wonderful .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	excellent album .
0	this is fantastic ! i have seen this in a lot of show , but never in a live show , and never in a club show either .

0	i received a cd from the library a couple of week ago , and i have been listening to it non-stop since . it ha been a great gift for me . i bought my son the same cd .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i love the beatles . this album is excellent . this is the best beatles album . i love the beatles . i love the beatles so much .
1	i bought this album when it came out in 1986. i have been a fan ever since . i listen to it on repeat . i like it when she go into the song with a little bit of a different vibe . her voice is amazing and i am very happy to have a copy of this .
1	i love this cd . i think it is the best music i have ever listened too . the sound is great . the bass line is very nice . i think it is great . i will buy it again .
0	i just recently heard this song and it wa absolutely amazing . i liked it , but the chorus is a little too long for my taste .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	there were a couple of good song , but there were also a few bad one . i would have given 5 star if only one song wasnt so terrible . i would suggest that the cd is a great introduction to learning to sing , since it is short . there are only three song on the cd , but they are all on the theme of the four season . the song of the four season is a good song , but the song of the four season are awful . they sound like commercial music put to bad use . sunshine is a nice song , but there are a couple of other song that are just awful . i am the walnut tree is a good song , but it is a bit too short and could have been expanded on . i would suggest that the cd is a great introduction to learning how to sing , since it is short . there are only three song , but they are all on the theme of the four season . sunshine is a nice song , but there are other song that are just awful . i am the walnut is a good song , but it is a bit too short and not a good song . the christmas song is a good song , but again , not a great one . silent night is a good song , but it is a bit too short and doe not go along with the theme of the cd . the star spangled banner is a good song , but it is a bit too short and is not a good song . o come all ye faithful is a good song , but it is a bit too short and doe not go with the theme of the cd .
0	this song is absolutely awful . it is so bad , it is downright pathetic . it is really annoying how much i hate this song .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	i think this is my favorite album . i like the song and they have a great sound . there is a real sound to this album .
1	just another great prince album , i wa expecting more of a hit , but not really disappointed . the album start slow , but it get good after . i will buy this one .
1	i think this song is a very good song , i like it , i like it , i like it , i like this song , i like this song , i like this song , it is my favorite , it is my favorite , i love it , it is my favorite , i like it , it is my favorite . i love to sing and i have a way of getting people to listen to me , even though they do not know me . i think it is a good song and i like it . it is a good song , very good , good , good , good , good , very nice , good .
0	i love this cd . i have the other one , so i do not get to hear the other song , but this one is great . i would buy the cd again . the price is good . this is not a music cd , it is a band cd .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
0	this is not a song i would have picked to start my cd , but then i did not know what to expect . it is not even a song i would have picked to listen to if my dad gave me an album to listen to . even if the cd came with a bunch of other song i might have picked to start my cd , i would have picked this one .
1	this is a great collection . i am not a huge fan of her music , and i do not know why her book is not available .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
0	i think this album is great . i like it . i really like it .
1	i do not know anything about these guy but i like the song . the song is a little different from the other song on the album . it is just a little bit more mellow . i like the name of the album .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i do not have a window phone but i love my laptop
0	this is just a bad album , and i think it is one of the worst album i have ever heard in my life .
0	i wa expecting more from this cd at first . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once listened to it . however , i wa expecting more than what i got . i am a fan of her music . i believe in what she is doing , but i have to say this album is a bit disappointing to me .
1	this is a great album ! i have been listening to this album for a long , long time , and yet i still can not stop listening to it . it is a mix of different style of music and it is a wonderful experience . it is fun , sometimes the song are a little fast , but i have loved every song on this album .

1	i am a longtime fan of this group and this cd ha left a wonderful impression on me .

0	this is my favorite song on this album . it is very catchy , and i like that it is not too loud .
0	i like the dave clark five a lot , and i like this album . it is good but i really do not like the album cover .
0	really great song . i have always thought that the song wa written by a group of child playing with their toy , because it is repetitive and repetitive . a great song .
1	i love the beatles take on this song . if you like the song , you will like the album .
1	i really enjoy it . i am glad i bought it .
1	i love this album . it is different . i like it .
0	i did not like this album and think it is quite bad . the song have nothing to do with each other .
0	i am quite pleased with this song , although it is a little long . the piece begin with soft , quiet violin . then , in the middle , the violin are interrupted by a solo violin . this violin make a few more attempt at playing the theme . there is then an instrumental break during which the entire orchestra play a variation of the theme . this is repeated in the third and fourth movement . this is then followed by the final solo violin . the solo violin make several solo effort . in the last solo , the violinist play a solo violin passage in the middle of the piece . this is then interrupted by a solo violin that start to play a solo violin part . and then , the final solo violin . the whole thing is very fast paced and very loud . this is a great rendition of this piece . i have been listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of day . i am quite impressed with the recording quality of this song . i would say it is a good buy .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?

1	this is like the best trance ever , and i highly recommend it . i love the sound quality .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	i have been listening to this song for quite some time now and it is still one of my favorite .
1	i think that this album is the best trance album so far . i like this album a lot and i think that it is just good .
1	the song itself is a good song though , i like it . the song is simple but it ha a nice beat . it is a good song to listen to . just like i like listening to the beatles , i like listening to this song . it is different , it is good , and it is a nice song . i do not know if i would buy this cd , but i would listen to it though .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .

1	i have not heard of this album before , but it is very good
0	i listened a few time to this cd and i really enjoyed it . i liked the song and i like the vocal . i like the fact that it is a new song and i like the fact that she ha a new guitar sound . i do not like the fact that the cd is on my computer three time - i am not a computer person . i would not buy this cd again .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	i love this cover ! it is a great way to open up a song . i would recommend a listen with the original version of the song though . i think i will get the original cd anyway just to hear the original track .
0	i liked the music video , but the album is pretty bad . this is a waste of time and money .
1	i liked this album a whole lot better than state of trance that i have . but i like both album . i still like both .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i
0	i bought this album because the first song i heard wa the title track and it sounded so good . so i bought it . and , after listening to it i have no idea what i am talking about . i have listened to it several time and i do not know what i am talking about . i guess that is my only real complaint about this album . i am not a big fan of the vocal . the only song i would recommend is all alone with something to say . i guess that is it . and i do not know where to start with this album . but , do not listen to this album . i do not like it . just do not listen to it . i do not know what the album is supposed to be about . i can not even find a single song this album ha something to say about .
1	i wa not familiar with this band . i love this song .
1	i love singing this song . i love the vocal arrangement and playing it with a band .
1	this song ha made me cry more than i ever thought i could . it is a great song .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i like the band . i like the music .
1	this is a really good song .
1	it is a very good album . the song are really good . i do wish there wa some more variety in the song , but the song are good , and i like them .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i like how steve morse ha grown a a singer and the more he sings the more his voice change . he is a good singer . i love his voice .
0	i am not a big fan of ohearn at all , but i like this album . i usually do not like to complain about a bad album , but i am going to do it because this album is not a bad album , it is just not very good . it ha some good song in it , but not a great song per se .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	this is a great album . i am enjoying this one very much . i would like to see more song like this !
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i purchased this album after listening to it on my iphone .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	i am sorry , but that is just not who i am . i wish i could play better music , i know i do . however , i am afraid that i can not because i have to pay someone to play this for me . i am sure there are other professional musician out there , like myself , who would be willing to perform for free . i just do not have the time . i have to pay someone to play the music for me . i hope i do not offend anyone by saying this , but i do not think this is what country music is about . i feel that it is a watered down version of american music . i do not think that i would want to listen to a song , like the one you listed , that i actually wrote . if this country music thing is really what country music is all about , then i would just a soon stick to the classic country song that i grew up with . in my opinion , country music is a bunch of guy who sound like they are in a car . they sound like they are singing to them like they are a woman . they sound like they are singing to a girl who is just a phone call away . the only way to make the music better would be to make it a female singer and a male singer . i do not think that is what country music is about . i do not think i have to pay someone to play this for me .
1	i love this song . it is very relaxing and doe not get boring . i recommend this song to any and everyone .
1	i have bought this album . i like this album .
0	this is an excellent set of performance , ranging from the mellow folk rock of the acoustic set to the heavy rock of the electric set . jerry garcias playing is exceptional and his vocal are also a highlight . this wa the first time the grateful dead played on the west coast . i am very happy that they had this opportunity , even if i do not agree with the way they handled the situation . it wa a great show and i hope it get released soon .
0	this is a commercial cd , because it is the latest in a line of cd to be released by a label called fwd . i own a handful of the fwd album , and this is the first cd that i have purchased that wa not worth buying . i really do not understand why i would pay this much for something that is inaudible . the music on this cd is boring and ha almost no groove . the only way this cd could have sold is if fwd put a lot of money into the design of the cd . i am sorry , but this cd is a waste of money . if you have the money to spend on this cd , go to a better label .
0	i do not like it . i do not like the band . i like their music .
1	i like this band . i like them . i like their music . i like their song .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
0	i love this band and have been listening to them for year . i bought their album black hole sun with all of my money and my hard earned cash . i bought the dvd and i have been enjoying the show ( i have seen them in concert multiple time and i have been listening to them on their cd and dvd release ) .
1	my favorite album of all time . i have listened to this record a lot . i like it a lot and i think it is the best thing out there .
1	i have to be honest , i have never heard this song before , but it is definitely one of the better one on this cd . i am a big fan of christmas song , and this one is especially nice .
0	i really like the song . the song is catchy .
1	the entire band is a fantastic group of musician and they have a very unique sound . i really appreciate the fact that they have a very unique sound and that they are able to have a very unique sound . the song is outstanding . thank you for doing this cd . i think that this is a wonderful idea . it is a great way to get more people to enjoy the music . it is a wonderful idea . i appreciate the fact that you are doing this cd . i appreciate the fact that you are doing this cd . thank you for doing this cd . i like the fact that you are doing this cd . i like the fact that you are doing this because it is something that people can enjoy . i would like to say that you are doing this because it is something that people can enjoy . i really appreciate how much you are doing this . thank you for doing this . thank you for doing this . i really appreciate you doing this . thank you for doing this . thank you for the fact that you are doing this . thank you for doing this . thank you for doing this . thank you for doing this . thank you for thinking this is a great idea . thank you for making a great idea . thank you for doing this . thank you for making a great idea . thank you for making a great idea . i really appreciate you doing this . thank you for doing it . thank you for doing it .
1	i love everything about this song . i think it is one of the best song i have ever heard . it speaks to the soul .
0	this is a great album . i have had it for several week and have listened to it several time . it is a very good album . i am sure that tom wait will continue to have a career with his music . his music is unique and ha a very personal touch to it .
0	i would have bought it for myself but i did not like it . no offense .
1	this is a very good album . the music is great . i love the song it is gon na be alright and the song i wan na be her is a masterpiece .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i love this album . i love the song on it , the lyric , and the singer . i love that she take the time to do good work . she ha the ability to make me feel happy and excited .
0	this is the only cd i have that ha the lyric of the song on the cd . - i have this cd at home and i am disappointed in the song selection . a cd of song that are not a good a those on reo speedwagons first 4 album . -
1	this song wa on the i want to hold your hand cd and i wa a big fan of the song i want to hold your hand . this song ha a great beat to it and a great message . i thank god for the opportunity to have heard this song .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	i am not a fan of this song . i have listened to this song on the radio a few time , but i could never get it to work on my radio . i thought it wa really good , but i could never get it to work . i think that it need some more of the instrumentation that the beatles had and the instrumentation used in the beatles version of this song is not there in this . this is a really good song to play on the radio , but i think that it would be better if there wa more of the instrumentation that the beatles had used in the beatles version which wa not there in this version . also , it need more guitar solo in the beatles version which wa not there in this version .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a few week now and i am enjoying it . i think it is a great mix of all the genre . i do not know if a cd with that much variety or that much variety of genre would make it to my cd player - but i do not think it would .
1	this cd is great ! i am amazed at how much i like it . i would recommend this cd to everyone .
0	it sound like a chapbook that ha been passed around in a circle from room to room . the lyric are not really relevant to the music , nor is there really a message . it ha a strong , yet very annoying , sound effect . the song is not that good . i have listened to it maybe 100 time in the past three year and have not listened to it since it wa released . i think you should go to the video store , and get one of her other song .
0	i do not like the music video . i like the song , but the video is really bad .
0	this record is just so well-rounded and diverse . the musicianship is incredible and the band play with great energy and passion . the album is well worth the money .
0	the cd wa delivered in very poor condition , with a crack in the plastic case . i wa very disappointed .
1	this is so overplayed at the gym that it is now a joke . if this were the kind of music that would be played in a film or tv show to create a theme or background music , i would be understanding . i prefer the original version . but this is just a generic , boring song ( except for the opening note ) , which get no applause . you are lucky to get a grunt !
0	i got this album because i like the music . i like the album . i like the cd . i am a fan of the dave clark five . i like the song the greatest show on earth . but , this is not good . this is not good . i do not know why i bought it . i don ; t know why i bought it . i do not know why i bought this cd .
1	my favorite song on the album is all alone with something to say . i love this song . i love this song .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	this is an excellent song with great sound quality .
1	this is a great album with a great production .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i like the song . it is a great song . i would rather listen to it than the radio . the lyric are good .
0	i want to like dave clark five . i have a cd of their music . i like hearing their music .
1	this is my favorite song on her next cd , which come out in 2011. it wa also on her first cd . it is a great song . she is a great singer and an amazing song writer . tom wait is a great musician who can make a song sound like anything . this song is great .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i do not know if she really is a great singer , but she wa a good dancer to me , and her voice ha a great range . i like the song and would recommend it to anyone who like old school hip hop music .
1	this is a very fun song , i have heard it a few time , and i like it .
0	the song is very good , but the lyric are very long and the song is not catchy .
1	this is a very nice singer , and she doe a great job with the song . i did not think the piano part wa a good a it is , but it is fine . i wish she would do a song like you are the one that i want because that wa a great song . she ha an amazing voice , and she is great with this song . i really like it . i wish she would do more of these song . i like it a lot . the song is good .
1	i like bonnie and the rest of the reo speedwagon band and this album is great . the song are so catchy and fun , and i like that they are very different than what i am used to hearing . i am a big fan of the music industry and i really enjoyed seeing the whole band on stage in their first big concert in a long time .
0	this is crosby , still & nash second album . it is a live album from their 1979 tour . it feature four song from the album , and two other song from the previous album , but the song from the current album are not included . the recording are from the tour , and are not live , but are on the new album .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	i am a huge fan of the band . i really liked the song on this album . i really enjoyed the album . i really liked the song . i would recommend this to anyone . i really enjoyed the song on this album . i really would recommend this to anyone . i liked the song on this album . i would recommend this to everyone .

1	i like this song .
0	this song is a nice song but i am not that into it
0	i really do not care for this album . i gave this a 3 because the song are decent , but the album sound so bland and generic .
1	i like this song very much . i have been listening to it for day !
1	the first dave clark five cd i wa very impressed with . the music is all very sweet and loveable , and i could listen to this cd for hour .
0	i loved this cd when i first got it . unfortunately it ha only played for a short time so i think it is time to put it back in the closet .
1	i enjoy the song .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do .
0	this is a great album . this is my favorite . i like all the song . they are all good .
1	it is one of my favorite . i think it is a really good song , but i do not really have it on my top 10 favorite song .
0	i wish i could give this album 5 star , but i think it is only 3 out of 10. the lyric are not very good and the song are unoriginal . the music is good , but very average . i do not think he should get a much credit a he did for this album , he basically just put a bunch of band together and recorded them . the album a a whole is not worth the price of the album .
1	this album ha a very classic rock sound , along with great country music . great rock/punk/rock/country/rock/country/punk/rock/punk and it is all there in a way . the album is very catchy and i love the sound . the album ha a very classic rock/punk rock sound .
0	my daughter and i listen to this cd all the time . it is very well put together . it is a good christmas gift . i like the one liner . i have never heard one so long before and it is very nice . i am listening to it right now . i would not buy it again .
0	i like the song . i would like to see the band sing the song in the movie . there is just too much singing in the movie . there is a lot of singing in the movie .
1	i bought this because it wa on sale , so i had to give it a try . i have never owned an osmond album , so i had to do my research . the album is nice and ha a few decent track , but there is not a lot of diversity in the composition . the best track is the hand and when i fall in love that came with the album . i found the album to be a little too similar to whitney houston . the album ha a few good track , but i wasnt really able to get into them . i would recommend this album , but only if you are looking for a whitney houston album .
0	i just bought this cd on a whim , thinking i had to have it . it is good , but not great . i just got tired of hearing only her old song . i know she is a pretty good singer but i wa hoping to hear her take on some new song . i just wanted to hear some new song from her . it is not bad , but i just can not stand hearing her singing old stuff . i guess i will wait until she is not singing old stuff .
0	it is one of the great live album . the performance are outstanding and the musicianship is brilliant . the song are great and the performance are fantastic . the recording are excellent and the album is well worth the money .
1	this is the best cd ever . i love it .

1	i am really surprised how much i like this song . i love the song . i think this is a great song . i like the guitar part and i like the vocal . i like the song . i am not sure why i like the song . i think it just because i like the music . i am not sure why i like the song . i do not know the song at all . i heard it one time when i found it on the internet and then i remembered how much i liked the song . i do not really know what the song is about . i just like the song . i think i will like it even more after hearing it one more time .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	love this song . the vocal are good and the guitar work is great . this song rock !
1	i think i love this song . it is very catchy and fun to dance to .
1	the dave clark five are one of the most popular and important jazz band of the 20th century . their music ha been sampled in everything from britney spear oops , i did it again , to the original soundtrack of the movie hairspray .
0	this is a really good album , but i think the song are too much like one another in the wrong order . the song are not very listenable .
0	what a great song , and a great cover . it is a shame the studio version is so short . robert
1	this is a very cool song and video . i like it a lot !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	i think the song are great .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i love this album . this is my favorite beatles album . i love the beatles . i love all of their music .
0	i love it , but i am not sure it is worth it . the band ha always sounded good , but this is just a little too boring . it is like they got bored and decided to just throw on some white noise , sadistic music , and then pretend it is some kind of jam .
0	i like this cd . but it is the same song over and over . i do not really know why people enjoy this cd so much .
1	this is not a classical christmas album , but it is an album that is suitable for christian use .
0	i think this is a great song . i love the music , but the lyric are not that good , so i would not recommend this to anyone .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i love prince with a passion . this is the best prince album i have ever listened to . it is like a masterclass in prince . i wa amazed at how the song fit on the album . they are all different and have a great flow to them . i wa so impressed . this is the best prince album .
0	i liked it much better the first time i listened to it .
1	i never bought any album by reo speedwagon , but i received this one in the mail the other day . i did not realize that it wa the first album
0	i love the song , but i do not like the lyric .
0	this song is not bad . it is great .
0	i have a hard time playing this on the piano . i like this a lot .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
1	this song wa a little long for me . it wa fun to listen to but i would recommend the original .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i have the cd and i love it . this is one of the best jazz album i have ever heard . it is a very diverse album . i love the song and the arrangement . a good jazz album is hard to find . this is a very good jazz album . i really enjoy it . it is a great purchase . i recommend this album to anyone who love jazz .
1	the one i like the best of all reo speedwagon song is the heart of rock n roll . it reminds me of when i wa a kid and would run through the park singing and trying to be a rock star .
0	i love the album . it my favorite .
1	this song make me want to go to heaven just to hear it again . i love it !
1	i love maria houghton voice . she is very talented . she is able to sing various style of music . this album is very musical , and it is beautiful .
0	this is the most boring album i have ever bought . it is so boring . the most boring album i have ever bought . the worst album i have ever bought . seriously ? this is a complete waste of time and money .
1	i love tom scott ! this is the only cd i have made it by . there is so much good music out there and i think tom scott make it all so much better . i love his unique style .
0	this song wa a waste of time .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	most song were terrible . she sings better by herself .
1	i really like all the song on this album . it is great !
0	what a great version of the song !
0	this song is perfect for the fall .
0	this is a gift from my girlfriend . i love this record . she is awesome . i listen to this almost every day .
0	the song is good , but the video is the only reason i purchased this disc . when i first heard the song , i wa taken back by the lyric . when i saw the video , i wa appalled . i did not have to hear miley sing , i could see her lip moving , and i could feel her lip touch my cheek . i did not enjoy the song and her disgusting video . this is not in my top 5 of mileys song , she is a very good artist but not a great singer .
0	like the album but not the cover . the music is good but the cover is awful . the title track is the best of the album and i am just wild about harry is a good song . the cover is very bad , you would not know it wa a beatles cover until you open the cover . there are only two song on the album that i like and that is the best track . i also like i am only sleeping and the end . the cd is quite good but the cover is not worth the money .
0	this suck !
0	i did not think i would like this piece , but it is great .
0	i think the song is boring . it is like a song from a movie . it is like a piece of a movie .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	this cd ha so many great song that it is hard to choose . i have been listening to it for about 2 year and i never get tired of it .
0	i have listened to this album for year and have always liked it . the song title seem to be the weakest part of this album and they do not really need them . sometimes , you realize that there are more song on the album- i wa always reminded of the wailing or the lord is my shepherd . this is his best work yet . i thought he wa going to make an album a la michael w. smith that wa not repetitive and did not talk about the same thing . however , he did make an album that ha good song and is not all about him- that is not to say this is bad- it is merely different .
1	i just bought the cd to listen to . when it arrived , i listened to four song . i do not care much for her music . i do not think i will buy any of her cd . she is not what i think she should be . i do not think her music is good . her lyric are terrible . i just
1	i like the story , the music , and the lyric . i would recommend this to anyone who like classic rock music .
0	i got this cd for free from a friend . i am a fan of the artist . i love the music and the lyric . this song is a favorite of mine .
1	this is the best cover i have ever seen . i really like the member of this band a well , and i think they do a great job with this . and the cover is great !
1	this is one of the best trance album i have heard . this is a great album .
0	i love this song but could really use the music credit on the cd .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	my husband hate this song . i love it . i can not seem to find the music to this song . is it the same a this or is it different ? i love it .
1	this album is a very good one and i enjoy it a lot . i like the originality of the music .
0	the chorus is so good .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	i never thought i would like beethoven 9th , but i have been listening to it since i first heard it a a high school student , and i am very pleased with the recording . i have heard it on several recording , and this one is my favorite .
0	this album had some good song .
1	this song , when it wa first published , wa an original composition , entitled babe . the word , and the melody , were written by dr. fredrick c. johnson .
1	this is actually a music video . it ha been out for year but i just found out that they are releasing a dvd with the sound of the movie . i wish i had known earlier . it is worth watching . the movie is very well made . i have seen several other music video recently and they are all very well made . the video is not only a music video , it ha a storyline and is a good movie . it ha a beautiful soundtrack .
0	this is the last song i have heard , and it is just meh .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	i can not believe this album is 40 year old . i can not believe it is still in print . i can not believe they still make them , a well . the album start out like it is going to be light and playful , but a i listen , it turn into an album that is just a heavy and dark , but somehow , it work . it is great .
1	this is a live performance from the 4th of june , 1976 at the manchester town hall . the dead had been playing for 5 year and the band wa still going strong . i am glad i got to see the dead live again after so many year . it wa great . the song were great . the sound wa great . the band were tight and the concert were great . it is a great show !
0	one of my favorite . i have heard this song many time , and it never get old . i really like the video , too .
0	this is a wonderful piece of music . i like the recording , but like the end that doe not make it to the final cut . it is the first time i have been able to see the final mix with the ending removed . i like the arrangement and the singing , and would have preferred to have received it on cd . i have been trying to get it for year , and have yet to see a proper release .
1	i love it and the video .
1	the band live album are always good . i purchased this one because of the cover and wa pleasantly surprised .
0	i love this album ! it is a good album but for the price it should have been better .
1	i think this is the best version of the song . i love how it a cover . the lyric are great . i like the guitar solo too . it is really good .
1	i do not know what to say . i just love e.s.posthumus . i have been a fan for a long a i can remember . this recording is perfect .
0	i love this song so much , i can still hear it in my head a i write this . i can not stop humming it .
1	this cd is a great collection of song from the beach boy . dave is a wonderful guitarist and i would be happy just to hear him play one song . it ha a great cover . i would like to see this band on stage . the song are great . i am sure it will sell well . i love this band and i love their music . i would recommend this to anyone .
1	i love it ! i have always loved this song , and i love the lyric too . i love the video , it is a beautiful video .

0	this song used to be one of my favorite , but now it is one of my least favorite . i can not stand the word , but i still love the music .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i think this is a great song !
1	i am glad to see this band is still around .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
0	this is a cd of unreleased live recording by the kink that were broadcast during their time in the uk . i like this one . it is a little better than the album version . the kink were at the beginning of their career and i think this is the first recording of them at this time . it is also a good representation of the song they released a single . i wa able to hear this during their live performance in london . it is well recorded and ha some interesting song . i did not realize until i listened to it that the kink sang in harmony , which i like .
1	this is horrible . the song are not good . the quality of the sound is poor . it is not worth more than $ 0.00 . i do not think that she would have
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	this song is awesome , but the song could be stronger . it is very good .
1	i love this movie ! the original is so much better ! there is no point in listening to this .

0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love the song , i love it , i love it , i love it , i love it , i love it ! i love the song , i love it , i love it , i love it !
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	there is nothing wrong with this cd . i really like it .
0	this is the only song i have listened to so far . i am a big fan of skyworld , so i am hoping that the song will be good . it is a great song . the lyric and music together make up a wonderful song . it is also very good that you can change the background music by adding or subtracting different song . i have no idea what the background music is , but it will be interesting to see how it change the mood of the song . i guess that the instrumentals are good too . i can not wait to listen to the full album and try out the instrumentals . i have been looking forward to listening to this album for a long time . it ha been a long time since i have listened to any musical work .
1	this is probably the best album i have ever purchased . it ha a bit of everything . my favorite song is i have got a feeling and i also like the other song a lot . my favorite track is i am not there and marianne is my favorite song from the entire album . the lyric on marianne are so powerful and touching .
0	i am very happy with this cd . it is a very good cd . i give it 5 star . it is the first song on the album . the only reason i give the song a rating of 5 star is it is free .

0	the first line of this song always give me the shiver . i have listened to it for many year .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	it is from the movie the rocky horror picture show so it is not bad . i am not a fan of this version , but you are going to have to hear it at least once to know what i am talking about , and the movie version is better .
1	i am an old-timey country fan and i love this album . i would recommend this to any fan of this genre .
1	my favorite song is the one with the lyric all you have to do is go out and get some more .
0	i have been listening to this band for year and just recently discovered them all . i like the new record , but not a much a the older one . i do like the new one though . i really liked the first album , especially black diamond but it is not a good a the second .
0	i bought the cd . i think she sings better when she is alone .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	this album ha a lot of good song that i thought were pretty good . the album also doe have a few song that i thought were rather boring . i would have to say that i would recommend this album to any fan of christmas music .
0	i preordered this cd . i thought it wa just going to be the 1st cd in a series . i pre-ordered it . but i wa disappointed . i do not like their music anymore . i did not like this album nor the dave clark five . after i listened to it , i will probably not buy anything from them ever again . i am so happy that i got the first two cd in a box . i am not happy with this album .
1	i think the piano version is better than the original .
1	this song is the epitome of country music . i am a fan of johnny cash . i have several of his album and this is my all time favorite . it is an oldie but a goodie .
0	the first of his album on which he sings in english , with emma rydin and the orchestra . this recording is a single disc in the karajan catalog , rather than an album . the liner note are in french and german , which is not the best way to discover karajans music , but it is a good introduction .
1	if you have been waiting for this to come around , it is here !
0	this is the best album from bruno mar that i have heard . i really like it . it is a good album .
0	the song is wonderful , but the video is just not good enough . the singer in it is so unattractive and it just make the whole thing feel fake and cheap . the video is made like a tv show where the actor pretend to be someone else .
1	i love this song . very fun song that make me smile . the lyric are very interesting .
1	i like this album a lot . it ha a great combination of new and old material .
0	this is definitely a great album . this is the second one i have owned , and i am really happy with it .
0	i have to say that the cd is good , but the song are terrible . i do not understand this style of music . i do not want to listen to the same song over and over again . i want to listen to a different song each time i listen to it . i understand that this is the style of music that people like , but i think it is bad for people who like to listen to a specific style of music .
1	this album is more than just good music . just listen to the song and you will be impressed . the arrangement are great and the music is perfect . i love the harmony and the arrangement . i really love the music of the dave clark five . i think this cd is great .
1	this album is great , and ha one of the best song i have heard in a while . if you like a little more of a beat with your music , head to amazon.com . i love this album and would recommend it to anyone .
1	i love this album ! i love that hasselvander is writing his own review of his own music . this is one of my all-time favorite .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i tried it but it wa not very good . it wa ok , but not good . i would not buy it again . in fact , i would consider it a waste of money . i tried to listen to it without my ear bud , but i could not . it wa not good . i would not buy it again . i will just buy the cd of trucker and the cd of dancing with .
0	i like this cd a lot . i like the vocal on the song , and i like the overall feeling the song have , but a i said , i am not a fan of jewel music .
1	a great album . the beatles are one of the best band ever .
1	this album is by far the best i have heard in awhile . the song is so positive and i love it .
0	i do not really like this album . i heard it wa a hit and thought it wa a great album . i do not know why i did not like it more . maybe i did not listen to it enough . the song are good .
0	this song is great .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	i absolutely love this album ! great song selection and great lyric . this is one of my favorite album .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .

1	this is a very good album . the song are really good , the lyric are good . i think this album is worth the money .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	i will buy this album when i feel it is worth it .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	a friend gave me a copy of this book because she thought i would love it . i loved it , but my wife did not like it . but , i have listened to most of the song and they are great . so , i gave the book to my friend son . he is a big fan of classical music , and he love listening to classical music , but he is very stubborn and he will not listen to most of the album . so , he gave me a copy on his birthday . since people do not usually like classical music , i gave him some of the pop album . he gave me another copy on his birthday . i told him to listen to the album i gave him . i told him he should listen to all of the classical album , but he said he doe not listen to them . so , i gave him the book . he ha listened to every album , and he love them . he think the book is great . he told me to give the book to his friend . he is going to listen to it . i told him that he should . i told him that the book is great . he wa very excited . since he is a very stubborn man , he asked me to give the book to his friend . i told him that he had to listen to the album that i gave him and he had to listen to the classical album . he wa very excited . he gave the book a 3.5 out of 5. so , i guess it wa all good . i also told him that this is the book i have given to my friend that i love the most . i love my friend , and since i wa giving them the book , i wanted them to have it . i do not want them to get it . i wanted them to be happy with it . so , i gave them another copy . i told them to listen to all of the album that i gave them . i told them to listen to them all . and , i told them that they could give the book to their friend .

0	it is kind of hard to find a tom wait album out there . this is one of the best . the recording is very good . it is not the best , but very good . i would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of tom wait . tom wait is a unique artist . if you love his music , then you will love this album . this album is excellent . i give this album 5 star .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	this is such an awesome song . it wa my favorite hymn in the church choir at church . i love the chorus , and i love the fact that each person can sing it and it doe not feel like you are belting out a bunch of note . i love the way it is arranged .

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .

1	i feel like lareine is getting a lot of flak for this song . the first time i heard it i wasnt too impressed , but i have listened to it like a dozen time since and i am amazed at how powerful this song is . this song is an anthem to the people of africa and to all people that believe in god . it is a powerful song that can be used to speak to anyone that is willing to listen . it is a very good song .

1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	this song gettin down wa great ! this song wa really good . this song is very cool .
0	it is a pretty decent recording . this is the first cd of the dave clark five new cd , but it is the last one . they are very much their normal self . i would have loved to hear this cd recorded without the backing of the band , and then mixed much better .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i really liked this album . it is very good .

1	i really like your review . i find o ’ hearn very relaxing and relaxing . i like his music .
0	this is a song that i play when i am getting a girlfriend . i am not really a fan of the song because it is not a hit song . i like this song much better when it is on the radio for some reason .

0	this song is great . i really like it .
1	i love the last song , but it is just a really good song .
1	it wa a great song and ha great message .
0	this is the second cd from the new record label . very nice music . i bought it because i liked the way the last one sounded . the new sound is good , but i do not like the music . it is not modern to me . it is just not my style .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is a good album . i wish that they would have released it in a box set with the other album by the dave clark five . like the album by the count basie orchestra . it wouldve been a very great set .
1	i just bought this cd because i wa told that it wa a rare release by the band . i wa not aware of the band prior studio album , but i thought this cd would be a good addition to the collection of their first studio session . i wa not disappointed . i am a classic rock fan and this cd is excellent . i bought it in hope of the band releasing a new studio album in the future .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	i liked the song ; it helped a lot to take my mind off of my own problem . i wish songwriter would learn from artist like dave clark five .
1	i do not listen to tom scott enough but this album caught my attention when it wa first released . it wa a bit hard to listen to at first , but i actually found myself enjoying these tune more and more a the album went on . they are not necessarily unique but they are very well done and have a lot of energy to them . i have listened to this album a lot and i am glad to say i did not get bored of it . it is a great album to have on when you want to get down with your friend and when you want to dance and have some fun . i would recommend this to any tom scott fan and to anyone who like a good mixture of pop and rock .
0	i love the song , but i just do not like the video . the only thing i do not like is that she sang a verse out which made me cringe .
0	this song doe not really make sense . the lyric are cool , but it just doe not make any sense .

0	it is an abomination . it is so wrong . it is so wrong . it is so wrong . the noise , the noise , the noise .
0	i am a believer this is mileys best but i also understand that she ha a lot of issue and the song wa very strong . i wa a little disappointed when she did the video for it though . she looked really crazy and disoriented .
0	this is an amazing album . you will not be disappointed . a
0	i have heard this song on the radio , but i have not heard it on any record . this song is beautiful . i especially like the part where the piano play the melody . i have been listening to this song for many year and always enjoy hearing different version of this song made by different people .
1	i have been listening to this album from time to time and i usually find it much better than most of the dave clark five album . i really think this album is worth the money because of the great song that are on it .
1	this song is too short , but it ha good message .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	this album wa good .
1	i love the music in this site ! it is well written , and the music is really good ! i really like the song , and i think i will buy it !
0	this is not a bad album . the production is good ( but not the best ) . the song are good . i give it a 2 because the production is good and the song are good , but it is not a good a other broadway album .
1	this is a wonderful album .
0	i think i should have gone with this album over the last one . the sound quality is great . the song are a mix of some great song and some not so great song . this is another album that i will leave on repeat .
1	this is a great album . i have this album on my stereo and i listen to it all the time . i can listen to this
0	this song is so bad , i never understand why people like it so much . it is terrible .
1	this is great . this is one of my favorite album . i have listened to it several time now and really enjoy it , i wish there were
1	i really like this album . i love the oldie . i like tanya tucker . i like country music . i like it all . i love her voice . i hope i do not have to listen to it again . i love the whole album . i would buy this album again .
1	i like the music of the dave clark five , but my personal favorite album is the great pretender . i also love their other album like mister x , you can not turn around , candyman , and the way it is .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i listened to the album a few time over a couple month and wa hooked . i love the piano and vocal in the first two track . i love the album . i have listened to it many time . but i am not sure if i will get the cd , because i do not think it is available . i would definitely buy it again if it is available .
0	this album ha some good song , but the rest are boring .
1	i like this album a lot . i think you will like it too .
1	this song is a tribute to the band that introduced me to jazz . at first i wa drawn to this album , and i remember thinking that i wa in for a treat , but that wa before the jazz singer or a night at the opera came out.i have since listened to many of their album , but all blue is the one that stand out.and i am not just talking about the music , but the lyric , too . the opening line of the album is in the old day we used to walk out in the night and listen to the blue . and the blue , for me , come in the form of the instrumentation that i enjoy the most , drum and bass . when i listen to this album , i am really not just listening to the music.i can almost envision myself and the band playing on the street of new orleans in the 1930s . i am also a big fan of the blue , so it is kind of fitting that i have this album in my collection .
1	i have been listening to this album for two year now . i have been through some of the song many time . i am a big fan of the music and have been waiting for this album to come out . i have seen the band and have been listening to them for year now . the music is very , very good . i am excited to hear it for the first time .
1	i am really liking this album and this is a great song .
0	the only thing i really do not like about this is that it is boring .
1	this guy is my new hero . when i heard the album , i had no idea who he wa but i figured i would have to find out . i wa right on . he is absolutely amazing . i have been listening to his work since the 80 and have listened to every last track . the first song i heard wa love and happiness and i had to find out more . i am a huge fan of r.kelly and his work . i have been looking forward to this album for a long time . this album is something i have dreamed about for year , it is something they have been working on for a really long time and finally it is here . i am very impressed and happy with the quality of this cd .
1	this is a great song . i have always thought that the song wa written by a few child singing at the top of their lung . it is a great song .
1	this collection is a very interesting mix of music and i like it . there is some great song and even a few that i have not heard before . overall , i think it is a worthy addition to the collection .
0	this album is not bad , but it is not worth the $ 14.99 . i do not think it is worth more than $ 12.99 . it is not a bad album . it is just not worth the money .
1	i bought this song because i like i wan na be your boyfriend and bad romance by bruno mar . i thought i would like this song , and i am glad i did . it is really a great song .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is a great song . i can not figure out why it is only on a 2 disc version . i like the song . it is a good song .
1	dave clark five - live :
0	i liked the dave clark five when i first heard them . i would even go so far a to say that i like the dave clark five better than the beatles . i liked their music and wanted to know more about them . so i found this album and listened to it . i wa disappointed .
1	this song i love . it is very very nice .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	the album is decent . i like the cover art .
0	this album is great .
0	this is the best trance album i have ever heard .
1	not a great song but he is good at telling you what you want to hear .
0	all song are overproduced . none of them are original material . they use the same power ballad song for every song , even though the two that really stand out are the long road and new day .
1	this is a great album . it is so relaxing , just a lot of fun . i do love the song on this album .
1	a beautiful and unique recording . you will be surprised at the quality of this recording . it is worth a listen .
0	i wa very impressed with this record . i wa not disappointed .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	well , this is sort of a mix of a rock song and the dave clark five version . i like the dave clark five version better at this point . but this is a really good rock song .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this is really not a song . it is a song about the power of a woman who doe not listen to her own body . i am sure it good for some people , but i disagree whole heartedly .
1	this is one my favorite album of the year . i really enjoyed this album and wa disappointed that all the song were very short . i am very glad i bought this album . i would have liked to have heard more of the song .
0	i first wrote this song a a lullaby to my little girl ( now 8 year old ) and it took me 2 year to get the word right . i wa a little nervous but i had fun taking her to the park . she loved it .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	a mess . i bought this album because i did not want a david lee roth album . i wanted a david lee roth solo album . and this is pretty good . the song are good . the vocal are good . the guitar is good . but the vocal are terrible . i am glad i bought it . it is a good david lee roth album . but it is not a great one . i will get it again . i will buy it again when this mess is fixed .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . i can not praise it enough .
1	this is definitely not your typical country song . the lyric are great ! i love this song !
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i am a fan of the 90 new wave , and this cd is one of my top 5 of all time- it very good . but it is a very good album with mediocre song . but what more can i say .
0	there is no song that impress and the album is not worth the price .
1	this album wa so great , i listened to it twice . i really like the song and the band sound great live . the one thing i did not like wa that there wa no bass on the album . i do not know why they did not record bass with the musician instead of the band playing in the studio . but , they were still great . i did enjoy some of the song , especially the opening track , a little too late , but the album wa a little boring . i do not know .
0	not a favorite . i like his first album , but this one is average .
0	i like it because it is tom wait . i do not know why i like it .
1	i have been playing this song for the past few day and i am still singing it . i love the lyric of this song . it is a very beautiful song .
0	the only song i like in this cd is shine . there are other song that i like , but they do not take you away from the one song that take you away from the rest . i would give it a 4 star rating . it is a shame that the people that put this cd together do not know how to put a cd together .
0	i have listened to this band for a long time and i love it . i have many album that feature their music . there are some great song on this album . i have listened to it twice . it is great . it is great .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i like the song love in vain . i like all the song on this album .
1	this is by far one of the best radio show .
0	i can not quite figure out where most of the song are coming from . i will just have to keep trying . mark
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	this album is great . the song are great , the lyric are great and the music is great . this is one of the best album i have ever listened to . every song is worth listening to .
0	this album is a classic . i am a huge fan of jeff buckley and john mayer . i have this cd on constant rotation . the cover of john mayer guitar town is amazing . i am a big fan of both of these artist and am glad i have this cd . i really enjoy it .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	i love this song ! it make me want to dance and sing . i love the beat and the lyric are just a good . the music is great ! i love this song ! i have to say that this is the best song i have ever heard !
1	this song ha a good beat . it is not the song i would have chosen to sing , but it is ok .
1	amazing album . even after spending hour in the studio writing it , i still found myself singing along to the chorus after it finished playing . i could have listened to it all day and still had the song stuck in my head .
1	sam sparro is a great singer and musician .
1	i love the song , but i am not in the mood . i am out of the mood , and i can not download this . but i will listen to it again .
0	this song wasnt bad
1	i really enjoyed this album . music is good , lyric are good , and the video is a little annoying but not distracting .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	hasselvikr wa a pretty good show . the audience wa very loud but i still like the music .
0	this guy ha a great voice . i think he really should be signing with a major label .
0	i have to say that this is a real good song , but the lyric are too complicated .
1	i listened to this album with my daughter and i loved it .
1	this album really is great ! it ha some of the best song i have ever heard in my life .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	[ brandy ]
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i liked some of her song . she is a wonderful singer . i liked some of the song she did in the old day . she is the best .
1	i love her voice . she ha a very powerful and rich voice .
1	barbra streisand voice is not a strong a she used to be when she first sang this song . but it is still a nice song .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
1	this cd of the who is saturday night live performance is superb . i have yet to hear a bad song on this cd . i do find that the recording sound a little low , but it is still a great recording . i love this recording because i like the sound of the studio .
1	i always had a soft place in my heart for the best punk band of all time , the clash . i grew up on music with a punk edge , and i had a pretty diverse taste in the early 90 . this album wa part of my early purchase of many i bought , and this album wa one of the first one i ever got to listen to . i still remember the first time i listened to this album , it wa just a casual listen at first , but a time passed i realized it wa a masterpiece in the making , a classic to a generation of people who still love music .
0	this is a great song and i am glad i bought it . but it is quite a long song and you have to be patient with the lyric . and that is a bit of a drag . but once you get through it , it is a great song .
0	i have been listening to this cd for a while now and i love it . it is a musical journey that take you on a spiritual journey . allan bole
1	i have
1	i like the style of worship i listen to . i like the music of this album . i really like the style of music in worship .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i am not sure why i have not heard of this band before . the music is amazing ! the vocal are great , and the song are amazing . this album is good .
0	this song is one of the best of all of mileys song . it is so good , and i love the fact that there are so many people who just can not get enough of it !
0	this album i really liked . this album got to me . i really liked this album . i really liked this album . i really liked this album but i do not know why it is on my list . i do not know why it is on my list yet . it is not a bad album but i do not know why it is on my list yet .
1	i have listened to all of jewel cd . i found her song to be very enjoyable . i find her voice to be very pleasant . i have heard her album , and this is a fine collection of song .
1	i wa in the car and wa listening to my ipod when i
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	this is a nice album , i just wish i had heard of this band year ago . this would have been a must own for me .
0	awoh oh-oh-ohh oh-oh-oh-ohh oh oh-oh-oh-ohh oh oh-oh-ohh oh oh-oh-oh-ohh .
1	i have an lg g2 ( not the g2s , the s come out in the fall ) and i love it . the battery last all day and the screen is bright , so even when i am in direct sunlight it is not too bad . i can not say that about my iphone , but i would still recommend this phone if you go with a black one .
0	this song is not good . i like it but i wish it wa longer .
0	not a great program . i like the format , but it lack in-depth analysis . they do not analyze the song in depth , but they do bring up interesting theme and take on issue . i am glad they are still around , though .
1	this is a great cd . i have listened to it quite a bit , and found it to be an excellent addition to my collection of older jazz and blue . i have been told by a very close friend that it wa his favorite album , and i also had him listen to it and he agreed . i wa amazed that someone of his caliber would be so fond of the music , and i am also very impressed that he still ha it . i am not sure if he ha it in his collection , but i think that he would like to have it . i am told that the music is of a quality that is very rare , and i am sure he would treasure it .
0	nice song with cool sound , but song are a little too fast for her singing style .
0	i have heard all the song from this artist , and i have to say that i really love this song , i love the beat , i love the style of the song , i love the lyric , i love the feel of the song , i love the music , i love the whole song , i love the harmony , i love the voice on the song , i love the guitar , and i love the piano part , and i love how the whole song go . i love how the vocal are always on point , and i love how the whole song is not just a bunch of chorus and verse and bridge , but the song go on and on and on . it is amazing , i love the song , and i love the artist brandy , but i think this song is just a bunch of bad luck , because it doe not sound like a brandy song at all , it sound like a song where alfie boe is singing it , and i am sure that is not a good thing . please do not waste my time with this song . this song wa good when it first came out , and then it became bad and now it is become worse . please stop making this song , it is bad enough that you are making a bad product out of it , but add in your bad luck , it make it even worse . i have tried to listen to the song , it doe not sound like it at all , and i am sure it is not a brandy song . please stop making this song and i will gladly give you my money back .
1	i have heard a lot of the tom wait music and really like it , but this is the first one i have heard that i have enjoyed . it is not that i like his music , but i like his performance .
1	this is a great album , but if you only listen to the first song , it will be a letdown . the song are great and the sound are great .
1	christmas is the most wonderful time of the year .
1	this is just my type of music .
0	a good song . it is extremely short and the lyric are a little annoying but i do not mind . i hope this album is good .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i have many of her album and i just listened to this cd . i loved the title song and the chorus that start i will be there . i loved the chorus and thought it wa great to have so many song that are just a little bit different from one another . the song were really good . i thought they were a little bit too long . i just enjoyed the song .
1	this is a great song , i love it . it is definitely worth buying .
0	i have enjoyed listening to your music .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	this song really help me to relax , it make me feel like i am going to have a good day .
1	the collection is a bit different from the others i have seen . the song are mostly the same though . some of the track have the same chord structure , but the melody and lyric are different . the song are very good . this cd is great .
0	i just completed the process and this is not the first time i have received an error with this cd .
1	i love the lyric . they are so meaningful and beautiful . i love the beat on the song .
1	this is very good . the beat is great and the vocal are amazing .
0	this song is just plain boring . there is no melody . there are no chord . the lyric are just plain stupid . it is just a generic song .
0	it is not great , i agree , but i am listening to it for the first time .
1	this is my all time favorite song on the album . i like it all the time . this is the best song of the album .
1	i like this album and i like the music of lorde .
1	i can not review everything , and i like the fact that some track on this cd is a collection of multiple performance of a single instrumental piece . this may not be a good a collection a others , but it is a good compilation nonetheless . of course , there are some track that are just simply mediocre , but i think these are the exception to the rule .
0	this is a great song . i like it , but i do not think it is all that great . i do not know why people do not like it . overall , it is a great song . if you like this song , try this song . i like it , and i hope you like it too .
1	this is the best christmas album to come out of the last ten year . the only problem is that it is only available digitally . i would buy it anyway .
0	this collection is the best music of the 20th century . it music is so full of feeling and emotion that it take our heart and mind away and make u feel alive .
1	i like the song , but the music is just a little fast for my taste .
0	i believe she sings so well . it a shame we can not hear her in concert .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .

1	i like this song . the music is very nice and the lyric are also nice .
1	this is very good . i only wish it wa more than two cd a it will last for year .

1	tom scott , a always , is the best !
1	i love jewelry . i love this cd . i have been a fan since the beginning . it is just a great collection of song .

0	if you want a really good trance song that is a little different from the norm , this is it . very good , but it doe not change my opinion of this album . i am hoping they release a 3rd part of the album soon , because it would be worth it .
1	i really liked this song and i love it . i love the guitar solo , especially when you play it live .
0	i really enjoyed this song ! i love the music and the lyric and this song is perfect !

1	this is my all time favorite album by marie osmond . the material is excellent and the voice is wonderful . it is a must have .
1	i like music more than anything , and the only reason i bought this cd is because the cover looked nice . i would not buy it again . it is the most boring cd i have ever listened to . i would give
1	i have been listening to this album for year . i am completely in love with it . the first time i heard it i had a hard time believing it wa really happening . my whole family wa laughing at me . i did not understand what the song meant . then i went back and listened to the album a second time and this time it all made sense .
0	i love this album , very good but not my favorite .
1	i am a huge fan of his music . i am not sure if i ever heard that song before , but this is the only one i have never been disappointed with . i like this album and i enjoy
1	this is a great compilation of various song . i like all of them , but the first 2 song are my favorite ( i think ) . i wa listening to them on a walk and thought about how much i liked them ( i love this genre ) . i like the way the song are arranged . i like that they are from different decade , and i like that the song are arranged in such a way that they are very easy to sing along with .
1	this song is sung with more emotion . the song is a little slower . the song is beautiful .
0	i have listened to this album several time , and i think the lyric are great . i love that he sings about sex , and i love the guitar playing in this song .
0	this is a very good album . the only dud is the last song so alone .. i would recommend this album to anyone that like good music . this is a good album . i would recommend it to anyone that like good music .
1	this is the best record i have ever heard . it is an excellent example of what quality recording should be .
0	this is a very good bonnie tatum cd . it is very beautiful . it is very good and i like it a lot . this is my favorite bonnie tatum cd .
1	this is the first album i have ever heard by this band , so i have no idea how good it is .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	i love miley . i think she is very talented and should be rewarded for her talent .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i love this song .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	i did not buy this album . i wa hoping that i could get it at the time it release wa in july and wa told by the label that it would not be released until fall . i wa not expecting to get the album this much sooner than the fall , so i wa bummed . i wa hoping that this album could be released in the fall , but it wa not . this album is not a classic , but i really like it . i would say this is a solid album , but not truly a classical album . i would say this is a solid album , but not truly an album that can be called a classic . this is not a classic .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i really liked this album . it is a great mix of different style .
1	it is a really good album . the song are good .
1	this is simply awesome , the lyric are amazing , i love this album . i can not wait to hear it again !
0	the new album is very good . the vocalist are amazing . the album is very well done . i would like to listen to the two song that i have not heard before . i am glad that i found this album .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	dave clark five are a great band in a great area of rock . this is a really good rock song . this is a really good rock song .
1	if you have never listened to the beatles before , then this is the perfect album to start with . the beatles are the greatest band in the world .
0	this is a pretty good song . i think what make it so good is the arrangement . when i first heard this song i thought it wa a perfect pop song . the first thing i notice is the harmony in this song . it would be a good song if every instrument wa not part of the choral arrangement . the second thing i notice is the melody in this song . the melody is a great example of how a melody can be written in many different way . this melody came to me in a different way than it wa written . the third thing i notice is the lyric . the word in this song are very simplistic and it is a great example of using simple word to tell a story . the lyric are very simple and very true . this is a great song .
0	this is the album from the artist named , who i have never heard of . i purchased the cd with the intention of purchasing the cd . i wa really looking forward to it , but it doe not live up to expectation . i expected more . the album sound like it ha been put together with a computer , and not a human mind . i would never listen to her music on my own .
0	i want to know why did this song take off at all ? you really would have to be blind to not know that this is not a good pop song . this is not a good song that will have a great video . this is a poor song which will suck all of the pop song that have been released . i hope miley decides to not do this anymore .
1	the band that played the first time i heard this song and the last time i heard this song were the same . i love this song and have been playing it since i could first hear it .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i heard this cd for the first time this morning , at the gym . the first thing i noticed wa how it sounded like a bad mix of a mix . the second wa the way it sounded to me . it had a really bad sound to it that i did not like . but then , after a good 30 minute of listening to it , i heard a song on the radio i knew and love and i just listened to it . it took me back to the day of listening to my favorite radio station in high school . but this time , there wa a twist in the story - the station wasnt in the same city anymore . but i really liked the sound of the vocal on this song . and i liked the way it sounded a if it wa recorded in a small room . i just do not think it is that good . i think it would be better with a different vocalist . i have a lot of friend who like this song . i do not . i think i should get it back and let them give it another listen . i just do not like the sound of the vocal on this recording .
1	i do like the song on this cd . the only problem is that it is a little hard to understand . i think that it is better than most of the cd i buy . i think that if i had just bought a cd , i would have given this one a 5 star rating .
1	this wa one of my first ever purchase , and i have been listening to this album for year .
1	i love my iphone
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	this song is so annoying .
1	i just recieved the album today , and it is soooo good ! i listened to it in the car and it wa so relaxing , i have been searching for some relaxing music to listen to , this one is the best !
1	this is the cd i gave to my son for mother day . my wife and i both enjoyed this cd a well . it wa a sweet cd . i think he will like it . the song are simple , but the lyric are simple . i think he will like it .
1	i am in love with the sound , the instrumentation , the vocal , and the overall beauty of this album . i would recommend this to any fan of this genre . i am now listening to the album of all the artist on this album , and i am constantly amazed by the quality of the sound .
1	i love r.kelly . not only is he talented , but he is a talented singer .
1	i just bought the prince album this is it , i have never heard him singing live before and i wa very surprised by the quality of this recording . it is great , sound just like the record i used to buy a a kid . great album .
0	i love the song , but i am amazed that the singer can sing it ! he wa not a good a the other one i have heard ( i have heard them all ) .
0	i really liked this song . i really liked how it wa written . it is not a bad song . i really liked it . it is not a bad song .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i think it is a great cd . the sound quality is great and the song are good .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is a very good song that i would recommend to anyone who like light pop . it is about a girl who ha a bad relationship in high school . i would think anyone would like it .
0	i did not like this album . it is a horrible cover , and the music is terrible . there are no good song on this album . i would be very hesitant to buy this cd .
1	i have had the same problem with this cd - it play a short period of time when i turn it on and then pause and start over . i think this is very strange . the only time i have had this problem is when it play on my portable hard drive . i could not figure out how to fix the problem , so i ordered the new cd and i am sure that i will not have to order the new cd . i do not like the way the music play on my portable hard drive - i do not like the way the music play on my internal hard drive - i do not like the way the music play on my usb flash drive - i do not like the way the music play on my external hard drive - i do not like the way the music play on a different computer with win xp - i do not like the how the music play on a different computer with window vista . i do not like how the music play on my portable hard drive - i do not like how the music play on my external hard drive - i do not like how the music play on my usb flash drive - i do not like how the music play on my internal hard drive - i do not like how the music play on my portable hard drive - this is the cd that i wanted to buy - i do not like the way the music play on my portable hard drive . i do not like the way the music play on my external hard drive . i do not like how the music play on my usb flash drive . i do not like how the music play on my internal hard drive

0	this is a good song , but it is not my favorite song on this album .
1	i thought this wa the most amazing album i have ever heard ! i wa at a friend house when i first heard it , and he wa playing the bass and i wa listening to the guitar while he played . i remember thinking at the time how awesome it wa that a band that had not released an album yet wa playing this music . i have listened to many album that i do not like , but i wa really blown away when i heard this album . of course , i have to admit that i did not know what they were talking about when they did i will never walk alone or dream on - but i did not care . i really like the song on this album . i think this album is better than any album released by the reo speedwagon . the song just made me feel better about myself and my life .
1	i just downloaded this and i am not ashamed to say i am hooked [ to it ] . it is hard to believe this is the first time i have actually [ listened to it ] . i think it is really great , and i have never listened to anything [ like it ] .
1	i am a big fan of jewel and dave clark music . i love tiger moon because of the great beat , and the lyric are really good . i have been a fan of their music since heart of stone which wa the first cd i got . i have been buying their cd since the first one in 1964. i hope they come up with a new song .
1	tom scott ha put on a terrific performance .
0	i like this version ! i am a little disappointed with the lyric though a they seem to be a bit more of a departure from the original . the melody is good though . i like the arrangement . i like the overall sound quality .
0	this song is a little too long and sound like it should be sung to a tape recorder .
0	in the past , we have only had a few dead show , so we decided to grab a copy of this cd for our collection . it feature some of the best song that the dead ha ever written .
1	i purchased this cd at a local store and wa quite impressed . it is a must have for any music lover .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	my husband and i both loved the old man and the gun when we were younger . but the most memorable part were when the young cowboy in the picture got his horse killed and the young girl rode into town to get help . the two young girl were in a car , and they sang the song in the car when they were almost run off the road by a truck . the song wa very powerful and i know that is why it wa so well-liked by so many .

0	i bought this album to get a few of her song in my mind . what a disappointment . i hate being disappointed .
0	larein is a good song . it is not a very good song though .
0	this cd will be banned .
1	the recording in this set are absolutely wonderful , and there are plenty of them . i am not sure i realized that i had not heard this piece live before , but it is a delight to listen to this recording of the 1812 overture . the performance is full of emotion , and it is a real treat to be able to hear the soloist and the orchestra . i am impressed by beethoven mastery of orchestration , and this recording provides a great introduction to the beethoven symphony .
0	the first time i bought this album wa a gift for my best friend . it wa a gift for my husband . i like the sound quality of the cd and the liner note are very good .
0	i think this is the most overused bad song ever .
1	i never heard this song before but i love it . i like the lyric .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .

1	this song is a great example of the power of songwriting . it take a simple song and make it grow . it is a very good song and i hope this song get on the radio , because people need to hear and understand it .
1	this song is amazing .
0	it sound great , but i do not think it is a good one .
0	i have had this cd for about a month or so . i have not listened to it in a while , so i can not tell you much about it . but i would say that it is good . i would say that it is not a bad album , but i would not say it is bad .
1	the dave d clark five cd is an excellent collection of song with a good choice of artist . dave clark is not only a great song writer , he ha a great sense of the audience . his song are good quality . the beach boy are one of the greatest rock and roll band of all time and this cd ha great song from the beach boy .
1	this song is great .
1	the first album i ever bought from this store .
1	i think that the album is good , but i would have liked to hear some more song from the same artist . the album is good , but i would have like to see some more song from the same artist .
0	i would buy this if it wa available in store .
0	i wa extremely disappointed when i heard this album . i never bought a new album by her , but because it wa out , i thought it would be something special . i wa wrong . i really liked this album , but i wa hoping for something different . i guess i will just have to buy the other jewel album , because this one is just one more disappointment .
0	it is one of the best album of the 60 . it is one of my favorite . i like all the song . they are all good . it is one of my favorite . i do not think i will listen to it any other way .
1	love this band , love it ! i love the song , the music is great ! i love ohearn ! i have all his album , and this one is one of my favorite ! i own them all and this is my favorite .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
1	i am new to the site and am going to try to purchase something from it and i can not find anything good . this song is so annoying . i do not like the lyric and the sound is just awful .
0	i agree with the others . this song is bland and boring . i do not like hearing miley sing . i am not miley . i do not like the video . i do not like her clothes . i do not like her hair . i do not like her voice . she is not my type .
1	this is an excellent album for a dance party . the energy is great , the energy is high . i love how the track are so different and all have their own character . the vocal are very powerful and have great energy to them . this album is full of surprise , but it is one you will never forget .

1	great song to listen to .
0	i have the new lg g2 and love it . i am very happy with it . i am thinking of getting a g2s this year . i will probably get one soon . the battery last all day , and it is definitely a great phone . the keyboard is great for those who like to type a lot . it ha a great screen and the screen doe not get hot .
1	i like this song . it is a fun song and the sound quality is good . the lyric are quite amusing . i hope the band play at my wedding .
1	what is the difference between a self-titled album and a self-titled cd ?
1	i do not know where i got the song from . i just like it .
0	this is a good song , but the music is so very , very heavy for me . it drive me crazy . not so much the lyric , it is the sound that kill me . i will buy the cd .

0	the theme of this song is a positive one . i love the way they make this song sound .
0	another great version of the song !
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i like the cd . i am glad i have it on my computer . i like it , but i do not want to buy jewel entire cd collection . i will buy the cd this year . i have seen jewel at many concert . i saw her twice and she wa very beautiful .
1	this is my favorite song on the album .
0	i have been a fan of prince since the early 90 when he released the purple rain album . a i grew older his music became more commercial and i stopped listening to him . i am glad that i got prince comeback album . i love the song , the production is great and the lyric are great . i also like that this album ha been produced by the son of prince , thelonious martin .
0	i don want to waste more time on this . i would not even listen to it . i think it is a waste of time . the band is not very good and the recording is horrible .
0	i have always loved this song , but it is not his best .
0	i really like the album but it wa not worth the money . i would give it 4 star but i do not think i will buy it again .
0	hater gon na hate is a song that i had seen on the radio and it reminded me of what is the matter with you ? by naughty by nature . i thought this wa a great song , but i got nothing from it . this is not a bad song , but it is not a good one either .
0	i really like the album . i have been a fan since i wa a child , and i have always liked the band . i love their music and i really appreciate the band . this is a great album to have if you like power and rock and roll , or if you are a fan of older christian music . i hope they will make another album soon . i really hope they will make a new album soon . i have heard in the name of the lord is the best song on the album , and i hope they make another album soon .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i had to get this album on cd . great album . i really enjoyed this album .
0	this is a good song , but the lyric are awful .
0	this is a very disappointing album . i do not remember her ever putting out an album this bad . every track is a cover of a well-known song , and it is just bland . there is nothing new to the music , it just sound like jewel .
1	i love this album . it is very good . the lyric are beautiful and the music is really good .
1	this song is really great .
1	i know many of the song have been covered by others , but i think none of them are a good a this . the song are so well sung and there is just something about them that make me believe they are original . i do not think i have ever heard anything like it . it is almost like being in a church choir . it is just a very special and enjoyable album .
1	the chicago orchestra is the only orchestra i ever heard that play this many instrument . i have never heard an orchestra play the concerto in c major that play this many instrument . the chicago symphony orchestra is the only orchestra i have ever heard that play this many instrument in the right time and the correct way . i have never heard a chicago symphony orchestra recording that play this many instrument in the right time and in the correct way .
1	this album ha a really good mix of jazz and electronic music .
0	this is a decent trance album . it doe have some good track , but i did not really like any of them . the album ha very little variety , and it is very repetitive . the only track that stood out were moody mood and love theme .
0	i wish i could just put this album on all the time . it is a fantastic piece of music . so much color and energy .
1	this is the best way to read to your kid . this app is very simple to use and ha the best way to read to baby . there is no need to use a book !
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	just purchased this album , it is bonnies best since the best of bonnie raitt - i am very excited about this one !
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !

0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this album reminds me of the movie star war with all the music in it . it is not very good , but it is entertaining .
1	i do not know why i do not love this song a much a i used to . in fact , i can not remember the last time i heard it . i think we are supposed to love it and hate it at the same time . and it is great , and i am glad i have it in my car .
1	i heard this song a couple of year ago and liked it . i like it a little bit . it is not the best song i have ever heard . but it is a good song . i have not bought the cd yet , but am going to in the next few day . i like the song . it is a good song . i like it .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	so this is a good song . it is good . i like it .
0	i do not know if i like this album . i do not like the vocal . the song are good , but they are just too slow for my taste . i do like the production of this album , which wa done by the talented tommy liber . the only thing that really got me wa the vocalist , who sang the lead vocal on i am with you today . the rest of the song are very forgettable .
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i like the song , but i do not really like the song content . sam is just so boring . i wish he would just sing the song he is already sang .
0	this wa a good song .
0	i have not been very impressed with jewel album . i remember her being a much larger artist in the early 90 , but she is now a very small artist in the current music world . this cd is not bad , but it is not anything i would buy . jewel could have made a much better cd by performing a few of her song live instead of recording them on a computer .
0	just bought this album on itunes . a lot of the song on here remind me of the movie . very good music in this genre .
0	this album reminds me a lot of the godfather .
0	i like the way she sings . i can imagine her in the movie love story . i have not read the book yet , but i am looking forward to it .
0	i have to tell you , i am not a big fan of miley cyrus music . her album , wrecking ball , may have been awesome ( she can sing ! ) but i have never liked it . not because it is a stupid album , but because i feel it lack substance . it is not a great song on it is own , but when the chorus or the song is played , the song is better . i have to tell you i am disappointed in this album . it is only because i love miley . i still believe that she can sing , but do not know how . she is very talented and can sing . i have seen her perform at the white house and it wa awesome . she is a great artist . i love her . i just do not know .
0	the last album i have bought from them wa their debut . i thought it wa great . i would buy it again if i need to .
0	i really liked the song , but it wa a bit too poppy for my taste .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	this is really bad . i do not know how they found it , but it is just a mess . this song is so bad , it make me want to throw up . i do not know why it is on the top 100 list . i do not know why i am listening to this song , but i keep listening , and i keep listening , and i keep listening , and i keep listening , but i do not like the song .
1	i think this is a great cd . i really enjoyed the song on this album . i really enjoy the song on this album
1	it is really good . i love the song .
1	this is a great jazz album . it is very hard to find a jazz album this great . it is like a mixture of the great jazz of the 60 and the great jazz of the 80 . this is a great album that you will not regret .
1	this is one of my favorite album of all time . it is the best beatles album i have ever heard . the most brilliant song on the record , a great mix of song , great production , and great musicianship . it is a classic that is essential listening .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
0	i do not think i can handle this music anymore . it is really boring and repetitive . i do not think i can listen to this anymore .
1	this is one of the best , most calming and soothing album i have ever heard ! i do not like the song my girl because it is very loud and annoying , but the rest of the song are great ! can not wait for the next cd to come out ! : o )
0	this is an amazing song . i can not wait for the reprise .
1	this is a great song , and barbra streisand doe a great job with her voice .
0	i love this album , but i do not think i will buy it . it is just not jewel best album .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	the music is good . you can dance to it . you can sing it . it is a good song .
0	this is the most soothing song i have ever heard .
1	oh man , i love this album . i have it on cassette now , and i am going to buy it in a few day . i love the music , but the lyric really make you think . i love the music , but i just love the lyric .

0	[ brandy ]
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	you are probably thinking , oh , this is a nice cd , but it ha no lyric ! if you are thinking that , then the problem is you have not listened to it . this is very much a song about the feeling of a relationship in it final stage . at the very least , it is worth checking out . the two track on this cd , hiding place and happiness , are perfect example .
1	miley cyrus is the best . i love her music
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

1	love the album ! it is cute and fun !
1	this is one of the song that i feel had a major influence on the movie . this is one of the song that i want to hear on the radio , so that i can hear it in a movie . this is a very beautiful song that i have heard many many time in the past .

0	i wa looking forward to it . i wa excited to get it . i wanted to hear it . i wish i had not because when i listened to it i wa disappointed . it will never be something i return to . i do not think it is going to ever be a good a it is made out to be . in the end , it wa the sound quality that kept me from picking it up . i just do not think it is a good a it is made out to be . it is kind of a disappointment .
1	i really did not like this cd . i like the vus , but i did not like this one . i do not understand the difference between the two cd . both sound great , but this one ha a different sound . the vocal are the same , but the vocal sound different on the vu cd , but the music is the same . the new pornographer sound like they are trying to sound like the vu , but they do not sound like them at all . i think the sound on the vu cd is better than this one . i do not like the sound of all of the new pornographer song . i just do not like their music . i do not really know what to say about this cd . i just do not like it . the vocal on the new pornographer are okay , but i do not like their sound . i can not see the
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this album is great , and it is a good mixture of trance and jazz . i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good album .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i can not say enough good thing about this album . i love the album and i love the band . i can not say enough good thing about this album . i love the band and i love the album . i have been a fan of the band since i first saw them in the late 80 . i have seen them live about three time , and this album wa the best of the three .

0	i just bought skyworld and this is the first song that i got . i am amazed at how the lyric really describe the emotion and the feeling of the song . the music is also very good . i think this is the only piece of music i bought this weekend . i wa also disappointed with the quality of the cd player . it seems to work fine but i wish that the cd would be a little more durable .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !

0	i think these song are good . i like it when she sings ; i do not like listening to her sing . it is very annoying .
1	i love this song . the movie is so much better . there is no point in listening to this !
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	i love this song . it reminds me a lot of our song i wan na be free .

1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	the only beatles album i have listened to . this is a very good album . there are some good song on this album but it doe not have a much good music a most beatles album do . there is also a good amount of bad song on this album . the song are short and simple . they do not have a much variety a most beatles album . they have a good amount of good song and some good and some bad song . the lyric are very simple . the only good song on the album is i wan na hold your hand . the album is also very long and the song are all very long . there is a very good variety of song on this album . the music is good and the vocal are very good . the music is very good and the lyric are very good . there is also a good amount of good song on this album . the only problem with this album is that it is very expensive .
1	i love this cd . it is very good !
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this album is so bad ! i listened to this album for the first 20 minute and then i put it on and listened to for some 5 minute . i am not going to waste my time writing a negative review on this album . this is a very bad album .
0	i like dave clark five . they were my first favorite band when i wa young ; they are one of my favorite band .
1	i love this song . it is a beautiful song and i love the way the melody is played on the guitar .
0	this album ha not only bad song but bad lyric and song that are just repetitive . i do not like this band . i do not think it is worth buying .
0	this song really touched my heart . for those who do not know , i married a man who wa verbally abusive to me . he wa so mean that when i wa sick , he made me go on a vacation with him . when i finally got away from him , i ended up getting divorced . i wish there wa a song like this for a man who treat woman like this .
0	i like her and her voice , but i think the song is very bad . the only thing it ha in it favor is that it is not too long .
1	i bought 3 cd of this band from amazon . 1 for my mom and 2 for me . i can not wait to play music with my friend . i like the cd that come with the cd .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	a good mixture of jazz and electronic music .
0	the blue sound like it ha been there forever . i love tom scott . he is one of the best blue musician in the world . this album is very good . i wa not a fan of his first album , so i wa excited to hear his second album .
0	i love e s posthumus , but this cd is a waste of money . the song are bad , the lyric are bad , and the band is a bunch of loser . this album is a waste of money .
0	i got a song called let u talk for free , and this song is just awful . the lyric are so lame , the beat is so boring and not at all how it should be . it is a if they did not even try . it is just a crappy song .
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	i really like the first three track . i like the way it is , but the other track are a bit lacking for me : you do not know me and in my dream . the album sound very generic to me .
1	very good ! i love lareine but this is amazing ! i like it a lot . i do not know what lareines next album will be but this is one of the good song .
0	so i recently bought this album and started listening to it and it is one of the best album out there . i wa at a loss for word a i wa so excited to hear this album . it is definitely worth a listen . i recommend this album to all my friend . it make me feel good to listen to and make me forget all my trouble . thank you for this album . you are awesome .
0	sound great ! the only reason i did not give it 5 star wa because i had to turn up the volume a little . the cd player will not hold an audio file larger than 32 kbytes . so i am giving it 3 star but i will give it a try . my only comment is that the cd player doe not have a cdr/cdrw . so you are stuck with the player .
1	this is a great song , but i would like a bit more of the background . this is not a dirty money type of sound , but a more rockabilly type of sound . i think this is a great song , and i will be purchasing it .
0	this is one of the best album i have ever heard . this album is one of the greatest and most amazing album of all time . the melody are so different and have so many different style . the album is an incredible masterpiece of music .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
1	this is the official soundtrack to the movie i am not the buddha and is very good .
1	i bought this cd while i wa in college and it wa a great way to listen to classic rock at a bargain price . i love that i can listen to this cd on my phone ! it is very entertaining and i am sorry to say that when i wa listening to it , i kept thinking where did the cd go ? that is when i knew i wa ready for a cd that would last . i have never had a cd that i wanted to keep for year .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .
1	i have not listened to this album but i would like to . i like the vocal and
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i love this song ! it is a great song ! i like it .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
1	i enjoyed this show . the listener is not informed a much a they are with most of the other show . they are interesting and informative .
1	this is a must own trance album ! if you like trance , you got it ! if you are looking to buy a trance album , this is the one ! this is amazing ! this is definitely a trance album you will love !
0	i like this album . i have heard this album before , so i like it . i liked the sound of the album , and i liked the cover art on this album .

0	this is one of the best album i have ever heard .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	this is a very underrated trance album . the only reason i bought this instead of state of trance wa because it had more track than state of trance , which wa my favorite trance album and i wa not going to buy it . i love the mix of old school and new school trance . the only reason i am not recommending this album is because it is not a great trance album , but it is a great album overall .
0	great album , but it ha too many song . the song are very repetitive and boring . maybe i just have a hard time remembering the song , but it is very rare that i listen to a cd without having to listen to it again and again .
0	bought this cd and thought it wa a real cd . but i wa absolutely wrong . i thought this wa a real cd with the letter a on it . i wa wrong . i bought the cd and it wa a cd with a w on it , not an a. i did get the music , though . i am glad i bought it , but i am glad it had a w on it , not an a .
1	i have not been able to listen to this album more than once , i wa so enthralled with the music i did not want to stop . michael
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	this album is great , but jewel doe not know what to do anymore . she is always changing it up , but it is not the jewel i used to know .
0	this album is one of my favorite album . i like the beatles , i love the song , but i love it all the more . it is a wonderful album .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	it ha been a long time since i have had a good trance album . i am glad i finally found this album and i will be keeping it in my collection .
0	i am here is a great song , but the video is so disappointing .
1	this is a wonderful book about the great and the great lost master of classical music . however , it is one very important artist that it wa not able to capture the magic of is , namely claude debussy , whose only recorded work is the last movement of his prelude for piano and orchestra . i have a number of recording of this work ( several on cd ) and i can truly say that this is debussy best work . anyone who want to gain a deeper understanding of debussy work need to read this book . it is not a biography or even a history of the composer . it is a biography of debussy a a person and his work . this is one book that you will never regret buying .
1	i use my phone everyday
1	i do not think i have heard one or two song on this album that i did not like .
1	i have been searching for a new music cd for quite some time . i am so glad that i found your site . i am really impressed with the variety of song on this cd . i give this one 5 star . great singing and great lyric . i am looking forward to buying his next album .

1	the song is good , but the lyric are not very clear . i downloaded it so i could drive to work and listen to it .
0	this song sound like a duet .
0	it is music from the 1960s , but it is not a classic period piece .
0	i saw this show at the hollywood bowl and it wa awesome ! the show is a little over 20 minute long , but the cast is great ! i wa surprised at how well they performed all of the song they performed . they definitely got into the swing of the show and the audience really seemed to enjoy it ! i will definitely be going back to see this show !
1	i saw this video on my wall , and it really moved me . the lyric are great , and the song is so beautiful . i love it .
1	so i wa looking for a new prince album for a few year . this album wa released a few year back , and it is a decent album . it is not really his best , but it is good
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	this is a great album , i agree . i like the album a lot .
0	i like this band .
1	i am loving this album . i think it is a great album . i could not listen to this album for more than 10 minute without wanting to play it again .
1	i like the song . it is very similar to one fine day which is one of my favorite tom wait song .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	this is the second mp3 i have bought from you guy . and the first one wa a good one . this time it is not . the song is not a good version of the song . i can not listen to it on my phone nor my ipad . the sound is a bit too loud and the lyric are very hard to understand . for the price i had expected better quality .
1	a really nice song . i do not know anything about the artist , but i like it !
1	great cd . his music is very personal . i have found it hard to find other artist that are a personal and a well
0	i do not have much to say about this album . i do not really listen to new release often , but i have been listening to this album for quite a while and i really like it .
0	this is an excellent album and the best song on the second side of the record .
0	very good , the only problem wa that there were no extra track on the cd . one cd is good , one cd is better . this is a very nice collection of song , although , i do not think it wa worth the price .
1	this is the greatest album of my life
0	this album is really cool . it is really hard to find and buy an album like this . but i like it . it is good for a while , then you will get tired of it . i am waiting for the remastered cd . thank you for posting this .
1	the dave clark five at their best . i have been a fan of dave clark since 69 and he is still a very important and influential musician . especially in the 60 . there are so many song i want . this wa by far the best release . really nice to have a cd with all song by dave clark .
1	this is a great song . it is a christmas song and it is very appropriate . the chorus is just perfect . i love the whole song and it is very good . i would recommend it . the only complaint i have is the lyric need to be a little more explicit . i like the song , but i wish it would have said something like . i am a good boy . i am a good girl . i am a good girl . i am a good girl . not that i would not like it , but i would like it better .

1	beethoven symphony no . 9 in d minor is a magnificent piece of music . it is the work that launched beethoven career , and it is a beautiful piece of orchestral music . it is unusual in that it incorporates a vocal solo by the soprano clara schumann , who wa a friend of beethoven . this recording ha been made in a professional recording studio , and it includes all of the solo and interlude that you would expect to hear from this score .

0	i do not feel this album is worth buying . i purchased it hoping for a complete compilation of her work , and i am disappointed . i do not understand why she did not release a new cd with the other song from her first 4 album , or at least a deluxe collection of all her song . i would have bought the entire collection , and would have paid a small amount more , but it would have been worth it for her to include the other song . also the album doe not have any great song on it that i really like . i find the song to be average in quality , but uninteresting , and i had purchased her first 4 album to hear the music i had not heard before . if she ever release a new cd with all of her song , i will buy it . if not i will wait until she release another album with more of her music .

0	this song wa originally released on the album carry on in 1971. the band rerecorded the song for the 1994 album the best of the best . the band had reworked the song with the addition of a third verse and a chorus . although i am not a fan of the song , i have to give credit to the band for the great song they recorded . not only do i agree with the band on most of their other song , this one is my favorite .

0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i like music that is not overly repetitive . i do not want to listen to something every 10 minute . i would rather listen to a song that ha the energy i would expect from the artist that made it . i would also rather listen to a song that did not sound like someone el song ( i.e . a song that sound like it wa written by a different artist ) .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .

0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for asecret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother .
0	i love this song . i have listened to it for year . i think this song is one of the best song ever . i am glad i found this song on youtube . i think that song deserves to be on mtv . i think this song should be on there . i will probably buy this song . i am glad i found this song . it is one of the best song i have ever heard .

0	very catchy song ! i can not believe it is taken so long for the song to be covered by a rock band !
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	it is the same song from the album , but with completely different lyric and i am not sure why the cd is called the journey because it is not really a journey at all , more like a big walk .

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song .

0	i downloaded this to practice for a country dance competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - they are easy to use and fast .
0	i received this cd to practice for a karaoke competition . it wa nothing more than a 5 minute recorded of a singer at a concert who did not know how to sing , and wa singing in a foreign language . the recording wa taken out of context and sold a a cd a part of a series .

0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	this album is not bad . the song are very much sung by the people who actually recorded the songs-the member of the group . i like the song alot . the two that stand out to me are i am alive and do not want to fight . i have heard i am alive many time and i can not get it out of my head . it is a great song and i like it alot . the song do not want to fight reminds me of merry christmas baby by the beatles . there is not much here other than song from the member of the band . i think it would be a cool album to have in your car .
1	this song wa not only written for our generation , but also our youth . it is an upbeat song , and a positive song .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	this is the saddest song i have ever heard . i had always wanted to sing this song .
1	i am not a big fan of johnny cash , but the song is very good . i am sure that this is not the only song he ha ever sung . i have a whole collection of his album . i would give it a thumb up .
1	it is good . it is just that the vocal on the second cd are a little bit off . it is not really a problem , just a minor annoyance .
0	i used to listen to mary album and thought she wa a great singer . this cd ha nothing to do with marie osmond , just a bunch of old song mixed with a bunch of new one . i do not understand how this cd sold so well .
1	the one thing i love about this cd is that it is not a typical jewel collection . it is not a collection of jewel original music , nor is it a collection of all of her hit . no , this is a collection of song that are more than just jewel original music .
1	this is a really good song with a great message . it is about a guy who can not have what he want because he is not a good a the girl he want to marry . the song is really catchy and the lyric are really meaningful . they show u
1	this song would be a great radio song . the video is very nice .
0	i do not like this band . but i suppose it is a matter of taste . i do not like the sound of this band . i do not think that they can fill a slot . i think that they are wasting all of the talent that is here . i think that the music is good but it is not good enough to fill a slot . they do not even seem to have a slot . they have wasted the talent that is here and the talent that is here is not going to fill any slot . i have no respect for this band .

0	the video for this song wa put up on youtube in 2000. i found it via a link on this site .
1	i like her music , but not her book . it is a shame because i would have preferred the book .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	i have a window phone 8 and i love it . not only doe it have more screen real-estate than my g2 , but it also ha a full keyboard , and the voice command work really well . i am not a fan of the touch screen , but it wa just a matter of time before microsoft made it work .
1	i love sam sparro and his music . this song is great . i think sam sparro will love this song a well . it is a great song .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .

0	i expected a whole lot from this cd . this is about the most rockin stuff i have heard her release . it just ha this groove to it that i love . the song sound like song that have been played live , so it just had this real feel to it .
1	this song just go to show that christian can really do anything they want . i wa surprised that this wa one of the more popular song in the album . it is also one of the most beautiful song on the album . my favorite song in the album is i will be waiting for you . if you like hymn , this is a fun song . i feel like it is a great song for wedding . i like i will be waiting for you is the best because it ha i will be waiting for you but no i will be waiting on you in the lyric . the lyric are fun and the song is upbeat so i like this . i also love i will be waiting for you because of it chorus . i like this song because it ha a little bit of a gospel/folk feel to it . it is easy listening and it is great . i also love do not take my cry away . this is a good song and it is sung by a woman . i like the song because it ha a good beat and it is a positive song . this song is also a good song to sing with others . it ha a great chorus and it is a really fun song . i also really like this song . it is my favorite song on the album because it is really positive and it ha a great chorus and it is a great song . i like this song because it ha the right number of different lyric . the lyric are good and it ha a great melody . i also like this song because it is great . this song ha a good chorus , it ha interesting lyric , and it ha a great melody . i really like this song . i think this is a great song . it ha a good beat , it ha a good melody , and the lyric are very positive . i also really like this song .

0	this is one of mileys most hated song . i agree with the others . this song is awful , boring , and annoying .
1	this wa an excellent choice . i liked listening to the cd of the waffle house song and pilot . the lyric are short and sweet and i liked the lyric on the waffle house song especially .
0	the vocal are really good , and i really like the way barbra streisand sings . i just wish this album had more song . it is an okay cd , but just not great enough to be worth the price .

1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	i love this cd ! the first thing i bought on cdbaby wa this cd , and i still love it now . it is my new favorite cd , so i would definitely recommend it .
1	i can not really see the problem with this song ( except maybe the lyric ) . miley is actually very talented and i enjoy her music , but i feel the lyric are really a little out there .
0	this song just doe not do it for me . i want to like it , but it just doe not really do it for me .
0	it is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	great album .
0	if you like the dave clark five , this is not the album for you . in fact , i can not think of one song in this album that i do not like .
0	this is the worst album i have ever spent money on . i have heard it twice now , and it is still on my computer . i do not know why it is still on my computer . it is not worth it . i am disappointed in the whole process , and i am getting the impression that it will only get worse . i would rather be reading a book or sitting at home watching tv . i really do not understand why this album is costing me so much money . it is not worth it .
1	i have all of cash album . this is the one i have and this song is one of my favorite . i have been listening to it on repeat for about 40 year . i bought the download for a friend of mine who is dying of cancer . my dad is dying of cancer . i thought he would like it but he did not . it is one of his favorite .

0	this album is very mediocre . it is just a very generic album with a lot of filler . i am not a fan of prince but i bought this album for my kid and their friend . they listen to it all the time and have started singing along . i do not think i will buy his other album because they are just filler .
1	this is a great album . just like the song one pure and holy passion say this is jesus ’ s day to be pure and holy , we should love our enemy and pray for their salvation . this is my favorite album of all time .

0	this song wa on the original best of disc .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
0	i wa told that this wa a cd with only one track , but when i listened to it , i found out that it wa the entire cd . this wa the same cd that wa in state of trance 2007 , but this cd ha more track of the same type of music that wa in 2007. this is a waste of my time , and money . if you are a state of trance fan , you will want to buy this cd , but it is just not worth the money .
0	i like this song , but when i listen to it , i think the song are too short , i do not like music , but i really enjoy the song . i would buy this song , again .

0	i have just recently purchased this album . it is the most beautiful sound of the album . i love this album . i can not stop listening to it . it ha been a while since i have been able to enjoy music like this . i would recommend this album to anyone . a must have .
1	this is not an official grateful dead album but , since it is the only one i have , i have listened to it often . i found it to be a very nice , pleasant , soothing , and pleasant cd , and i believe it will be a safe choice for my family and friend to listen to . i am not a dead fan , but i found this cd to be very pleasant .
0	this song is a little bit over the top . the girl singing it need to just sing it the way it is and keep it simple . i do not know why anyone would change the lyric , and i do not understand what the song is really about . it is just a silly song .
1	i bought the cd for my sister , she really liked it .
0	the music here is good , just a bit too cheesy for my taste . i like the first half of the music best , but the last half is a bit of a drag .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i have this in my car , but it would not play on my iphone , so i bought a mp3 version . i did not know what i wa getting myself into , but i am glad i did .
0	i have a copy of this cd , and i am glad i did .
0	this song ha a very nice melody . the song make me want to dance , but it is just not very exciting . the lyric are catchy , but the message is weak . i can not really call this a good song .
1	this album is the best album i have ever heard in my life . i like the cd . i would of been happy to get this cd . i like the album . i like the song in it .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	i like this song but it wa just ok .
1	i have not heard this song yet , but i like it a lot . it is a very good song .
1	it is downloadable and , although it is not , it is exactly what wa advertised .
0	this is the fifth time i have heard this song and it is definitely one of the worst . the song is so bad that it is one of the few which i have never gotten used to . i will not listen to it again unless there is a copy of it available for purchase . the fact that the song wa recorded in a church auditorium probably explains why the church choir sounded so bad . the lyric are extremely clichéd and the vocal are so bad that they are unrecognizable . the sound quality is also poor .
0	this is bad .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	i do not know if i have mentioned it , but i love this cd . i love the dave clark five . i love all the song they wrote . i really can not get enough of them .
0	this song is not a cover . i do not listen to cover . if the artist is good , i will listen to them . if not , i do not .

0	i love iphone
1	this cd is a good addition to anyones collection . i bought it for the first time . the song all alone is a very good song . it is a good song . i listened to it several time before i could get over the fact that there is only one song on the cd . i would recommend this cd .
1	this song is very catchy . i can not believe it is on an old cd . i really like this song .
0	there is a lot of material on this cd . i would give it 1 star if it wa not for the fact that my computer is so slow that i can not listen to it at all . i would give it 1 star if it were not for the fact that i will have to get another cd .
0	i agree 100 % . i could listen to the lead singer for day . the worst thing about it is that it is a broadway show . i do not understand why people would have a problem with it .
1	this show wa very good and he could see the audience . he sang very well .
1	this is a good album . i found this album to be a good album to start off the christmas season .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i really like this cd . i am going to buy the other cd i have ordered .
1	i am a big fan of music and have a huge collection of music , and i think this song is awesome .
0	i have never heard this song before and i did not remember it being on this album . i love the song but it is not his best .
0	this album would have been better with more song .
1	i love the song . i am a fan of miley . i have a hard time with the word she is so young , and so beautiful it is one of my favorite song . i can not stand the video . a soon a i saw the first picture i wa disgusted . i am not miley . i do not like the song . i do not like the video . i do not like the song . i do not like her .
1	i have never heard of this group before but i have heard their music and all i can say is that they are great . i wa very impressed by this album .
0	i am not a fan of the whitney houston genre , especially not the pop/r & b one . that said , she did have the most beautiful voice ever . it just sounded too much like other singer .
1	a good cd , but i do not like her singing style . the song are good , but the singing is not . i usually buy her album on the dvd , and i do not like the dvd cover art . jewel is a talented lady , and she need a better sound for her cd . my cd are on their own , so i can just listen to them when i want .
0	i like this song a lot . it is a good tune . i like it so much that i bought the cd version of the album . i do not know why i bother to buy the cd version . i find the cd only version to be so much more boring . i like it . i think it is good .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	this song really take away from the album . it a boring song with corny lyric and no guitar . but i do like it because the band had a ball in their live performance and this song really express their energy . i give it 1 star .
0	to amazon : if you like rem you should get this album . reminds me of the 70 , or the 80 when it wa the first time i heard rem .

1	i have already bought the two previous dave clark five album ( state of trance 1994 and state of trance 2004 ) . this one is a great album , with ton of song to choose from . the song wake up is one of the best song i have ever heard .
1	i am so glad i stumbled across this cd .
1	this wa the first cd i ever bought by this artist . i wa so impressed with this artist that i bought the whole disc . i have been listening to this cd for over a month and i love it !
0	it is good . it is good . what kind of music do you listen to , because this is awful . i know it is a cover band , but this is a little too much . i would prefer if they would cover the song that they do cover . i have the entire gnr discography and i will be buying the next album . i would be happy if they would cover this song , but i can not understand what the song is about .
1	prince is my favorite singer and i think this album is one of his best album .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	i am a fan of the pistol annies version of this song . this version is very popular on youtube .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .

1	i love listening to this song . it help me relax .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	the cd rock .
1	this song reminds me of the christmas season . it is very sweet and sentimental .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	miley cyrus ha a lot of talent . i will give this some time and see if it develops into something else . i know people will tell me that i am just another fan and that is fine , but i am not . i just want to have the opportunity to see this talent grow . i will give it some time .
1	i downloaded and played this song from the ipod store and had no idea what it wa about . in fact , i had never heard it before , but i like it . it actually is a beautiful song that i will listen to over and over throughout the course of the day , if need be . i highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates beautiful music . i downloaded this song from the ipod store , and i had no idea what it wa about , but i liked it , it is a beautiful song that i will listen to over and over , however many time , throughout the day , if need be . i highly recommend this to everyone that appreciates beautiful music .

1	i bought this album a few month ago and it ha been on repeat ever since . i am currently listening to it on repeat and i am still in the mood for it .
0	i do not mind that they did not use the original song , so i will listen to it .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i had an hd-ma1 system for about a month and wa impressed with the sound quality . the sound is extremely good & very clear . the surround sound presentation is also very good . i like the way the music is presented on a large screen , & the music move from one speaker to the next . i like the way the music is presented . this is a good album to listen to on the car .

1	i received this album yesterday and i love it . i really like all the music and the lyric . i am a fan of allan bole music and will continue to listen to his music . the album concept wa really good and it will be great for my wedding . i would give this album an 8.5 of 10. i would recommend this album to anyone .
0	i am very disappointed in the sound quality of this product . the only thing that make this product worth listening is the production value .
0	this is a great song , and the video is also a good one ! the only problem is that is is a double cd , and she ha a song that is only a single . i think she should have one song that is only the single , but one that is only on one cd . the song are good , but the lyric are not that good . i think she could do a better job at writing lyric . the song wa fun to listen to , but it wasnt worth $ 10 .
1	i used this to listen to on my ipod so i could play it on my ipod . i really like the song on this cd . i would give this album 5 star . the only reason i did not give it 5 star is because i really like some of the song . some of the song are really good , but if you could get it for cheaper , i would recommend it .
0	this cd is a great addition to our collection . the song are really good and she sings them well .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	this song made me feel good .
1	this album is a compilation of reo and speedwagons song from the early 1990s . a a whole , it is excellent . however , there are part of it that are pretty bad . the song do not give up , can not believe it is true and we have come for you are just ridiculous . the song you do not have to go home is pretty good , but it is not exactly you have to go home type of song . i will probably get the cd .
0	i have been a huge fan of the dave clark five since their first album the very best of the dave clark five . i hope they keep doing it , it wa a great album .
0	this wa ok. not something i like a whole lot , but good enough .
0	this wa the last beatles lp that wa recorded with all member . it wa the last album recorded at abbey road studio . it wa recorded in the same session a the album that wa released in the past . it wa the first beatles lp to be released with all member . it wa also the last beatles lp to feature george harrison playing bass guitar .
1	i think there are very few great album that are on the radio right now this is one of them . i really like the theme of most of the song . i have never heard anything like this album before . i think this is one of the best on the radio right now .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
0	i have one of her album , but i do not really listen to it anymore . i can not get through it . i have been listening to her other album instead .
1	i like this song a lot . i love the lyric , but it is hard to sing this song because of the high-pitch note . this is one of my favorite song that i have ever sung .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	i listened to this album a few time ( i think it is on cassette ) when i wa a teen and had a lot of fun with it . it wa a great album that i learned alot about the artist influence on this album . the one thing i did not enjoy wa the song i need you it seems like a really bad song to me .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	this is a good recording . it ha a lot of good song .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	i really like this song in my car but it just seems to me like the song is meant to be played . i do like the guitar solo though which is very cool .
1	this is the first album i have heard by this band . i liked the album title , and i liked the cover art .
1	i love the song a day in my life it is so nice and so fresh and so different , it is a great song .
0	i have a question , i wa told that the band wa supposed to play one more date before they were done . i saw them in concert last year and it wa a very enjoyable experience . i am a huge fan of the dead and i wa wondering if it wa the last show or something .
0	a decent enough song , but i did not like the song . i feel like this is a song about a girl who is getting ready to go on a date with a guy who like her and want to go out with her . i do not know what i would have done , but i know i would have gone with someone else . i do not know if this song ha any chance of going to be in the cd , but i hope so .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	this is a great song . it is a song that make me think about my friend , my family , and being a young adult . this song ha always made me cry . i am glad i found this song .
0	the only reason i have listened to this album a long a i have is because of the b-side - i believe it is titled a few of the smaller hit - i am not sure how many i have at my house yet .
1	i am a regular listener of this cd . i have been listening to it for a couple of year . i like it .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	i like rock and roll . but i like the band better
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough .
1	this is a great album . it ha a good mix of hard rock and electronic music . i will be re-listening to it .
0	i like the album , i like the lyric and i like the melody .
0	i really liked this song . it wa nice to listen to it .
1	i am a big fan of r. kelly music and have been for year . this cd ( the best of r. kelly ) is by far one of the best of his cd . he ha one of the best voice ever . and , he used it very well on this cd . this cd is great . the first cd i ever bought wa from the root of the earth , and i have been a r. kelly fan ever since . i have been through many cd and i have not seen one that i have not enjoyed . i just love this cd . i am very happy that i have found this cd .
1	this app really help my son focus and i love it . i love how it keep him from touching the screen .
1	my child really really really liked this song . my son wa singing it in his sleep . i think it is a good song , but my son doe not understand the meaning of the song . she loved the video though .
0	i like this song , but the lyric are just horrible .
1	i remember when this album wa released , i wa on the bus and playing this album constantly , it wa amazing . it is just a great album to listen to . i love the vocal . the sound quality is great . this album is a classic . it is great .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	it is a mp3 download . it is exactly what wa advertised .
0	this is a great cd . i have listened to this song over and over and really enjoy it . i love the sound of the piano in the background . i wish i had a piano like that a a child .
1	this is a great country song , very catchy .
0	i bought her a long gone story cd for my sister . i think it wa a good gift , i just wanted to make sure that i selected a good gift for my sister . although i did not like this cd i did not like her voice . she can sing and her voice wa very pleasant .
1	i downloaded this song for my friend to sing . they all love it . it is a really good song .
1	this is the second album i have bought by this band . i like both album and in the past i have bought other artist album and this is one of the best . this band is not from texas but from australia where the name of the band is the grate factor . i have bought a couple of their album and i will buy more . i do not know who this band really is but i really like it .
0	her singing is nice .
0	i did not know a lot of the song on this album , so i wa a little disappointed when i had to listen to it for the first time . i wa expecting a lot more from this album , but i think this album is also great .
0	i like this type of music . i can not listen to this all day long .
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i love this song . i love the vocal but i do not get much of a feel for the song . i am a fan of the dave clark five . if you like their music , you will love this .
1	i am not a big fan of the dave
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s . posthumus . i play it all the time . i never get tired of it .
1	this is a very good album . it ha good song both lead in and out . i really enjoy the song on this album . i hope that more artist from reo speedwagon will release album like this .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
0	there are a lot of review that say this cd is great , but i am not going to buy it because i am afraid of the sound and the volume . i know i will be giving it a listen at some point and i am going to give it a positive review . but if someone wanted to buy it and hear it for themselves they are better served by buying it from a music store . no one will know what it sound like .
0	i really enjoyed this album . every song is a good one . it would be easy to listen to all day . it is really hard to choose a favorite . i think it is a good album . i wish the cd wa longer , but i did not mind the length of the cd .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i am a huge fan of this band . the opening lyric are so great . i just love the song chorus . i love the song on this album .
1	i like this song .
0	the album contains the complete performance of the music of tchaikovsky from the time of his death in 1891 .
0	it is a decent album . i do not like jvj and i am not a fan of the other band member , but the song are decent . i do not think i will buy this cd .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
1	i love the music of this album , and i will be playing it for my child and grandchild . i love the fact that this album sound like old school punk rock , and not like some pop rock band that i listen to . i give this album 3 star , because , for the most part , it is just a lot of punk rock , and i would not listen to it a a first date .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
1	i have had this cd for 3 week now and it ha lasted . very nice . i am very happy with this purchase .
0	i really liked this one , but i wa wondering why there wa no audio of it . it is a really nice piece of music . it is very upbeat and fun .
1	this song is very good !
1	i love this music . i am not a fan of the way it go about . i like it because it ha a very good beat and make you feel good . however , when i compare this to other jazz record i hear the same thing in them . at least this one ha some good tune .
0	great album , i like this album but i am not one of those people who like album that do not start out .
1	i am in love with the simplicity of i am on a boat . this song is a perfect example of the art of songwriting . it is not overly complicated , is not over-the-top , and ha an endearing simplicity that just work . it is not an easy song to sing , either . i can not help but think that in order to get people to sing along and happily ever after to this song , it must be almost impossible . the lyric are simple and sweet , and i think they work to express what is most important to the singer , which is love .
1	this is one of my favorite and i do not think i will ever forget this album . it is kinda a mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in . my favorite song in the whole album is the best thing that never wa and i could listen to this album all day . i think this album is a great mix of new wave and punk with a little country thrown in . there is a good mix of rock , punk , and new wave .
1	i really like this song and it is a great song to get you started on the album . this song will definitely be one to listen to a lot .
0	the first single from the album , the boy is mine is a ballad , with a great beat , but the lyric are what really make this song . the lyric are very clear , and one thing he doe very well is to make his point in the lyric . i like kelly point of view on life .
0	i am sorry to say this , but this record is one of the most disappointing album in my collection . i have listened to this album many time , and i can not remember the last time i enjoyed this album more . i suppose i should have listened to the entire album , but i just wasnt feeling it . the album is full of great track , but the track are really weak individually . i love the trance sound , but this album just did not grab me .
0	i have seen no negative review of this cd . i have been listening to it for more than a month now , enjoying it every day . her voice is not the best , but it is nice to hear her sing . i would not give her a 5 star rating , but she is certainly worth a listen .
1	this is a great recording of the concert . i have the album for the first three song , and then i got distracted by the others . the sound quality is good , and the crowd is pretty good , but it is a little too loud and not a loud a the best recording i have heard . i think i would have preferred a better sound to this one .
1	i am a huge fan of ohearns music . it is always been a favorite of mine . i am not sure if i ever heard that song before , but it is actually an old song from his early day . it is always been a favorite of mine and is always a great sing song .
1	this cd is awesome !
0	i like this guy , i think he is a good singer .
0	i have enjoyed listening to this cd . it ha a great mix of song and style . i like the song that ponder ha written . i do not like the song praise is what i do i do not know why ponder wrote this song . it is not a good song . i would like to see ponder do a cd called the greatest .
0	the song is great . and i like it . i feel if you can make this song work , then the other song in the song will be much better .
1	jewel wrote a long gone song for her sister a a birthday present .
0	please get rid of this garbage . it is not worth buying .
0	this is my least favorite song . i do not even know why .
1	i got this cd a few day ago and i just love it . i love the way the voice is sung and i love the sound of the music . i have been listening to this cd for year and i still listen to it .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	i think this is an excellent app for all music lover . i downloaded and bought the song christmas ( bought a house for christmas ) by john lennon and it is so cool . i have been able to use this app to listen along while i am driving and i think it is a great app ! i have also downloaded the song christmas ( i am gon na be here on christmas day ) by james taylor . it is a great song to listen to while waiting in line at the grocery store .
1	this is a very good song . i love it .
1	i downloaded this to listen to while getting ready for work . i like listening to song while i am getting ready to go to work .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	i bought this cd to listen to , but i do not really like it . i would give it a 2. the only good thing about it is that it sound really good .
0	this song just doe not work . i love it , but it just doe not . i can hear what a great song it is , but it just doe not work for me .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	the dave clark five are still going strong . i think this album is a great one . i think this is an excellent album . it is a great album . i would recommend it to any fan of rock music . it is a good album .
1	this is the coolest cd i have ever heard . i like the variety and variety of artist on this one cd .
1	i have been listening to this album for a very long time . i think it is one of the best album of this year , and i have listened to this album almost every day since i received it . it a great album if you are into trance music .
1	i think this is one of my favorite song ever . it is so beautiful . i have played it to many people and everyone ha loved it . i have also played it to people who thought it wa just a boring love song and they loved it . it is just so beautiful and a really beautiful love song .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i heard this through a friend recommendation . i really like this song and the name of it is the risotto song . i think i will be back to take another listen .
1	i do not know if it is just my bias , but reo speedwagon is definitely a great band . one of the best band i have ever heard . i love the band and i love the music . maybe that is why i do not like their album . however , i feel like this album is better than the first one and i like the song better too .
1	this album ha a great mix of worship music !
0	i bought these cd to check out new release , and i do not get it . why are these song on my page ? they are all from song that are on the cd the longest day but do not appear on the record a long , long way to go . i am pretty sure i heard all of these song on the radio , but i would have to check the actual album . i would assume that this is one of the many re-issues that are being made . i would think that someone would want to make enough money so that these song could be re-released on an album . i do not get it .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	i have listened to this song a lot . and it is the one i have been waiting for . when i first heard this song , i wa in awe . it just soar . i feel like i have been waiting for this ever since i first heard it .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	this is not a song that i can really relate to . it doe not have a particular theme . sometimes i get tired of all the song with lyric , but this one is different . i listen to it a lot .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	another good cd from the dave clark five , that i recommend with open heart .
1	this is one the best jazz album i have ever listened to .
1	this is the second best metal album of 2007 , so far .
0	this is the same singer a on the last album . she sings the same old song but ha a bit more energy .
1	i wish this album wa in the u . there are too many barbra streisand . why can not they make some more barbra streisand ?
1	wow , this tape is amazing ! i have never heard a tape this big before , and most of these track are not available anywhere else . it is a tape that is extremely hard to find , and i have never seen a tape where almost half the song are from obscure band . there are no filler song at all , and you will find yourself listening to and enjoying every song on this tape . there are also so many different genre represented . this tape is not only a very special compilation , but it is a good introduction to punk rock and hardcore , a well a to other form of rock . i would urge anyone who is a fan of hardcore music to at least give it a listen . it is not only a great compilation of punk tune , but it is also a good way to get into this sub-culture ( if you are not already ) . the hardcore punk song on this tape are not only very good , but they are also very different from the majority of the band that are represented .
0	this compilation is a very nice addition to the music selection of a busy single parent who want to try out different artist . my daughter will listen to all type of music , and she will like this cd .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsoredshred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck !
1	this just rock !
1	this is a great album that i love . there is so much going on throughout the entire album . there is a lot of energy in the music and it feel like a lot of love is being put into every track . i love that there is so much diversity in this album . i also do not mind the different instrumentation . i really enjoy the more old school sound . i love that it is not all smooth and laid back . it is very very diverse and i love that this is the only album i have ever heard that is a mix of everything . i like it a lot .
0	the cd is a good introduction to singing a it is on the theme of the four season . the singer were good and there were some good song . the cd wa not a good introduction to singing . the song on this cd do not go with the theme of the cd . the song on this cd did not go with the theme of the cd . the song on this cd did not go with the theme of the cd . the song on the cd did not go with the theme of the cd . the song are not good . i would not recommend this cd to anyone . this cd is a good introduction to singing but it is not a good introduction to singing . the song do not go with the theme of the cd . the song are not a good introduction to singing . the song on this cd did not go with the theme of this cd .
1	i love the song
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	this wa a terrible song , boring , stupid , and with no melody . this is a mediocre song . it is a boring song .
1	i really enjoyed this song . it is a fun song . it is different . the album is good . i like the sound , and the song is good .
1	i have always liked this song , but never knew the lyric . i have to admit , though , that i enjoyed the vocal arrangement and the piano on this one .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	i did like it but the vocal are on the wrong spot and there are too many instrument on the background .
0	i have heard this song many time before , and i always find it pretty hard to get into . it is too serious . the lyric are too serious and the music is too serious . if you want a hard-rock rocker , then you should listen to black and gold instead .
0	i just wanted to say i am a big fan of dave clark and his music . i have had a cd copy of the dave clark five for a while now . i wa just listening to a cover version i like , and i thought what a great idea to have a dave clark five track on the cd . i have had a cd copy for a few month now and i am very excited to listen to the cd .
1	this is a great song ! the lyric are so good ! the music is not so good , but the vocal are great ! i will buy this music !
0	this is the only release from the late john lennon beatlemania period . this wa not the first single , but it wa the first to be released . it is a cover of the song my love from the movie jaw that also feature the vocal of his wife , yoko ono . this is one of lennon most famous song , and is a personal favorite . the sound quality of this cd is excellent . i prefer the stereo version of the cd and the cd is in mono . i had this disc on the cd universe and wa disappointed to have to purchase it again . this disc show the song in a much better light than the my love disc . it may even be the better of the two .
1	i am a big fan of r & b/soul/jazz . i do not think that i ever really like this kind of music . i do not even think that i have ever listened to this type of music before . this is a good cd though . i like the fact that it is a good album and it ha a high quality sound . i also like the fact that every song is different . it is very good .
0	i am a loser is a good song . i am so into you is not bad . the end is not really a song . do not stop believin is good . i am a loser is good . love me do is not bad . the end is boring . i can not believe that is good . love me do is good . the end is good . the beatles are no longer relevant . the beatles are dead . if they are still going to make another album , it is going to be with a different group of guy . i know , that is a little extreme , but i am telling you , they are dead . this album is a waste of time , and it will be a waste of time for a long time .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	this is a great album . the last album i listened to of riekers that i owned wa his constantine cd . this is a wonderful collection of song that are very well played and performed . the album doe have a few issue though like the lack of a few song on the cd ( i would like to have seen the cd come with the cd version of harmony in the valley it is an unreleased song for me ) and a few other small issue that i can not seem to find . overall i think the cd is a wonderful listen .
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	i think this song is a little over rated . i like what it lack in originality and creativity , but it is still a very good song .
1	this is the best song in the collection . it is a pretty good song . it is the most unique song in the collection . the beat is nice , and the vocalist
1	i have had a couple of problem with this app . the first one wa that the song did not appear in the song list on my phone . the second one wa that the song list would only list one song . i have been able to fix those problem by going back and re-downloading the song , but i am sure there is a way to fix this .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more .
1	this is a great song , i really love the video .
0	when i first saw the cd , i had to turn it off and then put it in the trash . i have never been so disappointed in an album or cd i have ever purchased . the sound came out extremely fast , and i have heard it many time over in the past . i could not believe this cd wa even worth getting . the album is really good , but ha little substance . it is a waste of money . i am putting it on my to buy list . you will be sorry if you get this .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	the opening track on the beach is really nice , and a great way to start an album . and it ha some great guitar and drum work for added effect .
1	great song . i know it is a little cheesy but it reminds me of a summer night in the mountain . it is a great party song for party and wedding .
1	i really like this song . i did not like it when i first heard it , but i have since heard a lot of tom wait music and have become a fan . i would listen to this song again .
0	this song wa the first song i heard on the radio .
1	my son bought this cd a a gift for me , because i have been looking for something to put on the shelf of his cd player for a month . he ha been listening to it every day , and i think it is really cool , and just the right thing to add to his collection .
0	i like it . it is great .
0	this song make no sense to be honest . it is not a very good song to listen to .
0	i liked the original better than this version . it wa a very good rendition .
1	i love my composer ( see review comment in the product page . ) it is a wonderful player . i have two different version , and i own several . it is a great value . i am very happy with the sound of the box . the only flaw is that the speaker are not very good . i tried using headphone , but the sound wa too low . i think they still have a lot of problem . i have had to fix them myself . i could really use a good cd player in the future , and this seems to be the best one i have found .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement .
1	this is very good and the song are all very original .
0	i am a bit disappointed with the band and the sound quality of the song .
1	prince greatest hit is amazing . the soundtrack to the movie is amazing a well . i could not be happier with it .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	a lot of beautiful song and nice lyric . i really enjoy her voice and i think that she is really talented .
0	for a good reason ! i had to listen to it for a while , but i really liked it . it made me feel better .
1	i do not know what to say . i liked it .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	it is an album of very poor quality
1	i think she ha a great voice .
1	new album better . i like this album better than the old one .
0	i liked the song uptown funk and the singing . i would buy her other album if i could hear them .
1	the cd is great ! i bought it because i love country music .
1	i really enjoy this album .
0	i really do not like this album . i do not like the album because the song are terrible and the musician are terrible . i do not like the album because the song suck and the musician suck .
0	this is not available in mp3 ( for one , it is about 4 hour long so you will have to download it from elsewhere ) .
1	it is a great album , especially for the price . the cover art is awesome . great album !
1	this is a very nice cd . i like the variety of artist that are represented here , and the fact that i could tell story and have fun with the song .
0	i did not buy this cd but my sister did . so i wa checking to see if it wa any good . i listened to it and then i went onto itunes to listen to it and i could not believe how boring it wa . i know the cd is suppose to be a gospel cd but i can not hear it . the vocalist are horrible . i think that this cd is supposed to be a gospel cd but i can not hear it . the vocalist are horrible . i would like to hear your review of this cd . i am going to give this cd to my sister for her birthday . i will be giving her a cd called my love by gwen whitemore .
0	i have been a huge fan of this artist for year , but this is the first cd that i have had problem with . some song play on the cd and some do not , which is frustrating because they were supposed to be the same .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	the only exception to the rule is the song heaven door , written by jerry williams and performed by the worship band . this song is a true blessing and is a song that is sung by people that are in a state of worship . this song is truly inspirational and ha an excellent message . i am a big fan of let it be by the beatles .
0	i liked the album . it made me want to listen to it more . i could have been more excited about it , it is just that i wa already pretty bored with it .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
0	i love this album so much that i bought it for my birthday !
1	this is the best song on the cd . the music is excellent , the lyric are not , but i guess that is a matter of personal taste . the song is a good one and the music is excellent . the only negative thing about this song is the vocalist . he can sound kinda high pitched sometimes .
0	i am a fan of this band . my favorite song is my favorite thing because it is very simple in nature but make me think about a girl that i have had a crush on for a long time .
1	this song is great for my daughter who is a christian . it is another song that put me in the right mood .
1	i love this song . i think she is very talented .
0	it is a very nice ballad . the lyric are a little hard to understand but , i like the way he sings the song
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
1	i love this song ! it can be heard in so many different place . it is positive , yet sad .
1	this is really good . i wa looking for a collection of the complete set , which i heard a a cd , but i bought it a an lp . it is now my favorite record !
0	this is a real treat for the discarding music lover , who is seeking genuine talent with the gift of music . i have often said that if one really want to know what they are listening to , then have a good look at the artist name a the clue to what to expect .
1	this song is so catchy ! the song begin with a guitar riff , which quickly turn into a very funky beat . i love the little guitar sound on the background while the guitar solo get progressively louder . the song is slow at first , but the beat make up for the lack of speed . the chorus is also very catchy and the instrumentation is very well done .
0	i am a huge fan of trance music but most of my favorite trance artist come from the uk . some of the track that i have heard from the uk are excellent and make me want to go there for a visit . i enjoy state of trance 2008 , a you can imagine . it ha some great song , but sadly many of the track on state of trance are not in the same league a i would like . i would recommend you buy the state of trance if you want a good trance release . however , i feel that if you are an all trance fan , state of trance is not the best album out there .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i will try to review it . it is a live recording . the band wa not good . i do not want to review the recording because it is just an mp3 download . it is a live recording of a live concert . so it is not like the cd . but i will tell you that they will sell a lot of copy . no , that is not a criticism . i am just telling you , do not buy this cd . it is a waste of money . this is a live recording of a live gig . and the cd are not .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	this is an excellent song . it is an easy song to listen to . it is upbeat and very nice . it ha a very nice piano melody . the vocal are very nice , especially during the verse and the chorus . it is an easy song .
0	i just got this cd last week and am very glad i did ! i am a jazz fan , and have been listening to her recording for year . i have always been surprised that i have never heard her play live . this album will be one of my favorite .
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
0	this is a great album . there is a lot of good r & b and it keep getting better . it is almost like they are just playing the hit again .

1	this wa a fun tape to listen to . there wa a lot of variety in the music , and the story wa good . i would recommend this to anybody who like classic rock and want to have a good time .
1	i am listening to this song on the radio over the last couple of day . it is a great song . it is a beautiful song . it is a song that i will listen to over and over again .
1	this is a great song . this is a great song . i love this song . this is a great song . this is a great song .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i think i enjoyed the last record but this one is ok
0	this is one of those album that i am always going to listen to when i am feeling gloomy , bored or depressed . it is a really great record , and one of the best of the 90 , and it is really worth the price of admission . a lot of people like the album . i would say it is one of the best album of the 90 .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the.mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
1	i love the song everyday is a winding road . i have listened to all of reo speed
1	i really like this album . it sound great . it sound like the sound of prince music .
1	this is an awesome cd and the highlight of my cd collection . the song are all very unique and original .

0	this wa my first reo speedwagon album , and i like it . i liked the country song , but i liked the bluesy song , too . some of the song are very well written , and some are not . i would buy this album again .
1	this is another nice song . it is a nice ballad , and the beat of the song is nice . the only problem is that the song is way too long .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i am a big prince fan . i have bought all his record and this is one of my favorite . i own every album ever . love his music .
0	i have heard this album a few time and have become a fan of the band .
0	i like this album a lot . but , i do not like the song . they are mostly too repetitive .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	lorde is a great singer . i love her music .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	this is great . i love the chorus . i would buy the album .
0	i have played this album for year , and i really enjoy listening to it . the only problem is the lyric .
0	great recording of this classic . sound great .
1	this app is just awesome and i love reading to my child .
1	it is the song heartbreaker . when i listen to this song , i just feel like i am watching a man being beaten by his wife . and the song is not over . it is just the chorus , and the final note of the song , that make me feel that i am watching the man beating the man . and it is a very positive and empowering feeling . jewel never disappoints me .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	i bought this cd to help me sleep at night . it work very well .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	i like the original version way better !
0	the new album is one of my favorite .
0	i love this song . this is another song i love to listen to on the radio when i am out and about with my grandson .
1	i bought this album for my son . he liked it so much he wanted one for himself .
1	i love this recording ! this is a great recording of our favorite song !
0	i bought this album because i wanted to hear some of the song that were played on the radio during the movie the hangover
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	a great live album from a great band . this is a must have for any metalhead .
0	the sound quality is not great so i can not listen to it over and over again .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	this is one of my favorite album of the year . i love the way the melody interact with each other . it is very hard to put in word what make this album great .
0	this album is great . barbra streisand voice is great on this and all other album .
0	i actually like the video , but i couldnt get past the lyric . the song is very boring . it is all repeating the same word and it is hard to follow . it is not original .
1	this is excellent !
0	i have been listening to this album for at least a couple of year now . i think i have listened to it two or three time probably when it wa released , but i have not listened to it in many year . there are a couple of song on this album that are really good . i think there is some filler ( the faulty song is a good example ) , but the rest of the album ha some really great track . i am sorry to say that there are some bad track on here , but overall this is one of the best trance album that i have ever heard .
1	i love this song ! i bought the cd hoping that it would be a good song . it is good to listen to the music of tom wait while he is playing .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	i have listened to this cd a lot of time . i like the song on this album .
0	i do not know who sang this song . i do not know if i like or dislike it . i like the cover of this song , but i do not like it a much . it is a dave clark five song .
0	i love this song ! , but the version i got is terrible . i would have liked some more version , but it is too bad that we have to have a we love this song version .
1	i really like this song . it is really good . i really like it . i am going to listen to it a lot . it is really a great song . i love the artist and the song . i hope they will have a career and continue to make great song . it is really a great song . this is my favorite song of all time . i really like it . i am going to listen to this song a lot . i really like it . i am going to listen to the song a lot . i am going to listen to this song a lot . this is really a great song . i am really going to listen to the song a lot . i am really going to listen to the song a lot .
0	this song is not bad . but lorde is trying to make pop music here .
0	this is a great song ! the song is catchy , the video wa very nice . this song is the best one off the album , even tho i do not really like the album .
0	i have a long standing love affair with the work of john kander . one of the main reason is the versatility of his voice . on this recording , john kanders timbre is rich and warm and his range from deep bass to high treble is impressive . i wa initially drawn to his vocal prowess , but i found the arrangement to be a bit confusing . the overall sound wa good , but the music itself did not have much to offer .
0	i wa a big fan of reo speedwagon , and i am excited to have discovered this new album . it is a great mix of style , and i really like the song . i would recommend this album to anyone who like their country music . like i said , it is good for those who like the country music , but it doe not appeal to me . i wish they had more country song .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	i am very disappointed with this .
1	i think this is a good song . it is more of a fast rock song but it is not over the top cheesy . the drum are good , and the guitar are decent . the lyric make sense and i do not mind that the song is on a treadmill !
0	while i have not heard these song for a while , i still listen to them a much a i can . they hold a lot of meaning for me that i am not sure why .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	i love this album and the music is so diverse , and the video is amazing .
0	i love to sing along with this song .
0	this song and movie are excellent . if you love movie , give this a listen . if you love the song , then this is for you . if you do not like the song , you may find it hard to get through this movie .
0	i like the way they do this . they make it fun .
1	awesome ! i love it .
0	i did enjoy this album . i have had several of her cd and this is currently my number one . one song i did not like wa the end of day and a place in time . it wa a good song .
1	oh yeah , i am not a fan of this album . i am not going to try and defend it , but i do not really find it to be a bad a i did the other one . the production is a bit lackluster ( the music is good , but the song are just not very good ) . however , i am not going to give it a 5. i would probably give it a 3.5 if i were looking for a good broadway album . i wish they would make a broadway album that is like the other broadway album , with better music and better production .
1	it is a great song . i love this song . i heard it on the radio the other day .
0	this is a good album . but not up to the standard of the other album here , such a the first or second album . there are song on this album that are excellent , but some of the song are too repetitive , not memorable , and just plain not good .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
0	i have been listening to this cd for about 2 week . i love this cd . i do not think i will buy it , but i will buy it again . it is very relaxing , but i will not tell anyone .
0	i do not know what i wa thinking when i bought this . i have the regular version , the deluxe edition is a rip off . the lyric are wrong . the music is wrong . the vocal are wrong . the overall package is wrong . it feel like a joke . i tried to listen to the song witch hunt that is on there , but it turned my brain off and i could not continue listening to it . i will never buy this cd again .
1	i love it ! i love how she sings it . it make me feel like i am in a movie . the video is not bad , but i like the song more .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	a collection containing the top song from the soundtrack of the movie of the most popular movie composer of all time . in a word this is an encyclopedia of great music .
0	i love the prince cd . it is soooo hard to find prince cd .
1	this is a very good album . i highly recommend it . these song are very different and enjoyable .
1	a a fan and a a musician , i have to say that i love this cd . it is an excellent album . i think it is worth spending a lot of time listening to . the lyric are great . the playing is great . it is a great album .
1	i think this song is a little too fast , but i still like it . the beat is good . it is a good song .
0	the worst song ever .
0	i really like this song . this is a great song .
1	i liked this song , and i think that the production is top notch . the best part of the song is the harmonica and the drumming , and the song ha a nice groove to it . the only problem is that the song end on a weird lazy way .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	this song is very catchy and is a favorite of mine . i would give it a 7. i love it !
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	great album ! it is a very good album . it is got great song and great production . this album is a great album . i think that the production is great . it is really good . this album is really good . great album . i like this album . great album .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
1	i like the dave clark five .
0	the only song i like is the one with the harmonica in the chorus , it is pretty good . the rest of the song are not a good a i thought they would be . i liked i have been here before , but it is not a typical country song
1	i like the whole set . it is nice to have the complete collection of bolero with the original album , plus the cd of dixieland . it is a very good set .
1	this is a great song ! i enjoy it . it is a good song to relax to . i am listening to it while i am doing my hair . you get the feeling of relaxation that you get from listening to music . i like the way the song flow and get you thinking about what you are listening to . it is a pleasant song to listen to . i am considering buying the cd .
0	this song ha it all . great lyric , great beat , and great guitar riff . this song is a great song .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting .
0	this cd is good , but i still think it is a little too short . i love the song , but the cd is just a little too short . if this cd were a little longer , it would be a good listen .
1	i love this arrangement of tchaikovsky 1812 overture . i particularly like the way it is mixed , a it is not at all noisy . this is definitely a live performance , and the performance of the overture is actually quite impressive given that there is no orchestra . the recording quality is superb , however . it ha the best sound of any of the recording in this collection , and it is possible to hear the soloist a well . the recording quality make this a must-have collection for anyone who enjoys this music .
0	i found out about this album through the radio . i did not know of it before that . it is a good collection of song , but it is a good album a well . i will still listen to it , but it is probably not one that i will buy .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	love this album . i can not wait for the new one .
1	this song is one of the best song ever written . the lyric are very powerful , inspiring courage in the listener .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	this album is what made this band on the map . one of my favorite . one the greatest song they ever wrote and still a favorite after all these year
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i love the cd . i just got it . it is my new favorite .
1	i love how you have mixed the song with the beat of the song . i can not wait to listen to the next song .
1	i like everything about this album .
0	the original version is better . the cover version is so much worse . i love the movie . the original version is better . the cover version is too bad . i love the original version .
1	this is probably my second favorite radio show .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	i am loving this song . it sound like a song you would sing at a wedding . the song is very clever and catchy . i loved it on the radio .
0	this album wa a bit disjointed . some were great and some were just plain bad , but i must admit i am a fan of the band a they have made some of the best rock music i have ever heard . some of the song are great , some just plain awful .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago .
0	a great album , but , overall , the band ha been on the decline for the last few year .
1	the steve morse band is the greatest . steve morse is one of the best guitarist in the world .
1	they are fantastic .
0	this is the best of the best of album . it doe not include any of the best of album . it is the best in the studio version of the album . the problem with the album is the song are too similar . i liked the band , but it doe not have a good enough song structure to be a contender for best of . i also found a few annoying melody in the song .

0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	i have not listened to the cd . i have not yet listened to the cd but i would not recommend the cd . i would not recommend the cd . it would not be worth my time to listen to it . i would not recommend the cd .

1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	i don know what to say . sometimes i really like her music , and sometimes i do not . i am a die hard fan of her music , but i have never been a fan of her book .
0	i love all her album , but this one is my favorite , because of the song like let the good time roll or i will give you . that i never get tired of . i really like the fact that bonnie is not trying to sound mainstream . i also like the fact that she is also a great singer . i give this album 5 star !
1	this song rock . it is very difficult to sing and it is very difficult to understand . i wish i could translate the lyric , but i am just going to have to assume that the guy who wrote it doe not understand what he wrote .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	i love jewel music . i have been buying her album since her first album came out . i have all of her album on cd now .

0	i never had the chance to meet him . i wa too young back then .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	i am not a big fan of this album . i have to listen to the whole thing to get the message in the song . i am sure there is some , but it doe not seem all that strong .
0	this is a very disappointing cd . the song played were pretty bland . i really like the music and this cd is a waste of time .
1	i love this band and their music . i really enjoy this album . i really love the song in this album .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing

0	this album is terrible . it is a waste of time . it is a waste of money . i do not understand why anyone would buy this . i do not like the pretender either . the lyric are terrible . i do not understand why anyone would listen to it . bonnie is a great singer , but this album is a waste of time .
1	this collection of christmas song ha been a source of inspiration and entertainment for me for many year . from the first song , a new kind of christmas to last , merry christmas mr. bank , i have been captivating and entranced by these song . these song have an incredible amount of heart , and great deal of meaning .
0	this wa a good one especially for a dollar . i have had it for a couple of week now , but i am not sure i will continue to listen to it . i do not know if it is because i am bored with the music or if i am just bored with myself . i love music , but i hate the music i like . i need to stop listening to the music i like .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	the song ha a nice beat , and it got the right kind of dance and groove that would be good for the season .
0	not my favorite hammond album , and definitely not the one i wa expecting , the riff are ok but the production is a little weak .
1	this is a great song . really nice , but i think the only thing i do not like about it is the intro . the rest of it is awesome .
0	this is a collection of rare , hard to find , and previously unrecorded song from the early year of bonnie raitt . it is a collection of song from the mid to late 70 that have never been released on any of her album . this is an amazing album . all of the song are great . i really love the song all alone with something to say and the song how much is enough . most of the song have an energy that is so hard to find in today music . it is just a great mix of old and new song . the sound quality is also nice on this album . if you like bonnie and want to hear some of her classic , this is definately recommended .
1	listen to this song and you will get the message . this song is a great feeling good song .
0	i bought several copy of this cd , and since then i have listened to it more than 50 time . i like the music on this cd . i love the song . it make me want to go out and celebrate .
0	this is a great song . i love the guitar and the way it build up .
1	i love my ipod touch . it ha this song on it and i listen to it everytime i get home from work .
0	first time i ordered cd i had to pay extra for shipping . so i thought i would try and get my disc in the mail faster . i found a way to do that . you have a wonderful site ! the music is what i have been looking for . i have been looking for a song to listen to while i do my hair . i have been looking for a song to listen to while i am doing my hair .
0	i like this album and i like the song lilith by e.s.posthumus , but the album overall is boring .
0	i like this song alot . i liked the video and i thought the song wa very good . i did not like the song at all . i thought that the song needed more energy and a more positive feel . i thought they could have used more energy and more positive vibe in the song . i thought that it wa kind of boring . i thought the first verse wa ok and then the second verse just fell flat . i thought the third verse wa boring and then the fourth verse just fell flat . i thought the second part of the song wa very good and then after that i just thought it wa too short .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
1	great album i love it
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	great
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	poor audio quality .
1	great song
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	sweet song and great lyric !
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	absolutely love it !
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
1	very nice , very niice .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more . do not get me wrong ! i do love a lot of van halens material , of both the roth and haggar era . but this is just not that great .
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	love this song !
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
0	not a great a i had hoped
1	the best
1	love it
1	this song ha taken over my life
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
1	fantastic song .
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	great old song
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole

1	great song !
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	great !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
1	what can you say lyle is lyle

0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
0	received wrong cd !
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
