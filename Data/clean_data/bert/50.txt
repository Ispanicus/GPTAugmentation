0	is wa very excited to open the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . you gone like the day where it seemed that they could do thing wrong . what ruin most if not all for the proceeding are the horrible chorus and madrox showcasing his new rap / singing persona in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in a least bit .

0	i got you lot from song to his amazon that we free and you did not trust all of him , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . cinema is great and music to listen in anytime . nobody really like it we found it to relief my stress at first . this wa well worth this five cent pricetag .
1	robert become a legend with the blue . a man who , some say , sold one soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his composition the listener can hear the fear with sadness of the situation , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know but such is true yet not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !

0	i wa very expected to get that latest from twiztid and i got ta say that am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed certainly they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the hit are the horrible chorus show madrox flexing his new screaming / singing voice in which he just sound like this tranny performer way past his / hers prime . not a good album here the least bit .
1	looked at our single off the good album . it an empowering song and really fit the theme of exploitation film !
0	i got a handful of song off of me which were free and i feel much like any amongst them , including this boy . i guess my wa worth no price .

1	amazing , entertaining , tender , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the atmosphere but at the same occasion a tear fall to the part of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit that accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of our musical including lmm lyric background music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if anyone ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

1	how many beautiful song that meet you in whatever stage your life depends on .
1	i not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . many loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , band needed to do an album like this in show their range . it is a little more mainstream , so the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still fantastic . do not get too wrapped up in music , it doe not help for their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the song .
1	who can your say to this album , it feature casting crown . love me !
1	nice song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , but hearing it will really bring back memory . wa way it is not going to hold it in these day , yet it is still like i feel .

1	part of his film that is too often recorded . it is not a shame , because the viewer is asked if his best work . let like he hear that .
0	his material is always bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , it is just bad , boring , no word , zero passion , merely generic , it is all . and to just put off my song after ai 2006 / 5 is just your management .

0	bought cd , but not song in song i play . rest of it and not good . returned cd not . now what ?
1	while not a dependent on the country and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , feeling their country sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in me opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but this great lyric , music , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped tonight around the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset a you may enjoy the listen .

0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	while not a dependent on the folk rock industrial sound , there is still an album worth checking out . listener loved their first two single , but their unique sound presented another potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it looked a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too worked up in them , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

1	if you do not know many , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber concerto , piano quartet , and others . i listened about the piano quintet ( from trout ) and the symphony sonatina . the recording of the sonatina credited peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . his sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the first set .
1	they really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise . song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a singing about the congregation arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , o love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a comfortable life on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song come that worshipper arise with those of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	i have got one to give to someone else . you noted that when this record were played of dj jax . there usually is not enough other instrument in the music . i have further learned not buy smooth jazz production that contain such variety of music from other musician .

1	although not a dependent on the folk and americana sound , this is quite an album worth checking out . i like their first two album , since their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like crossroad to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , power , and musicianship are most evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe i sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the album .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music feel awful . there is the reason the word religion is in the name , but is not people would be doing after we come to it .
0	if the station is running a amazon cloud collection , we keep thinking of making this purchase . if tune in technically did make this purchase , i do not like the song at all .
1	while based a lot on the folk to bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had that potential of turning into any hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is no little more musical , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it may not sound like their latest music , again and you will enjoy the listen .
1	good song . i listened to one when i wa a kid , and hearing one again really brought back tear . wa afraid but wa not going and hold on like these day , so it is only like been remembered .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought i had a nice , distinctive sound and recorded this cd . the instrument have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did seem like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the same repetitious sounding nature in the entire album . the arranger of choral leader seems to be stuck learning the basic harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el paso que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar no este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le dia de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en su vida y era latino . solamante cay gorda en hoir el primer sencillo de amor disco tu do yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir tu !
0	i used entire lot of song off of amazon that is popular and i did not get all of them , including one song . i picked none wa worth the price .

1	if you will not know schubert , this is very nice affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i motioned to that piano quintet ( the brahms ) among the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard now concert several time . her sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were also the price of the whole set .
0	this video from amazon cut off some rest of the loop right after the drum solo at my end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have a customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to try to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or so , a long term third is the entire song !

0	after hearing a few new liberas choral work on my internet guide , he thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased an cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not have translated . what it did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger not choral leader seems to have stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing a groove and rarely deviate .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . good man whom , some say , show his soul in the song to play the harmonica and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , so the reality of that fact is realized for bob johnson . i do not know what it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	wow so enjoy it ! did not mind spending 20 buck when people can listen through this on this saturday night .
0	after watching a few of liberas choral work via my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , clean sound before purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can never be doubted . what i did not like in a few listening to a first cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choir leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing of groove and rarely deviate .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a more affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) with the entire sonatina . the composer of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent artist being now heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for you the recording were worth the price of the box set .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy on playing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed to a background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain pitch - on key ! the instructor , katherine davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the first wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson from her . i think she could work all the stuff out of me . me really like this cd .

1	while not a dependent on early folk and bluegrass sound , now is still an album worth checking into . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an lp like this to show their range . now is a little more mainstream , yet the great lyric , vocal , or musicianship are still incredible . do not get too wrapped up in u , it doe not sound on their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

1	good work . i listened to this and i wa hang bell , and heard it again really brought back memory . ah afraid it wa not going to look way in these day , but life is easy like i remembered .
1	people love mr. kelly but this becomes about back in the day when bumping are grinding wa ok and peter did not see about stalker
1	this might be it ! did he mind another 20 hour when i can listen to this on repeat all day .
0	bad mix made on cd looked used , everything look bad quality but it doe not not also on the song that say in the cd booklet but the deluxe cd
1	do not are fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen on just . i really like it so are selling it relief after time at work . i wa well into the 99 cent pricetag .
0	i got a lot of song off your amazon where is free and i especially not like any of one , including this cd . or guess anything wa count the price .
0	meh . did not usually live next to the bill . could be gone better .
1	good song . almost positive vibe minus those rolling eye of the diamond blunt on the wall . smh killed him the first time i played one .
1	love the animal . good , good download !
0	extra cd , no not version of song wa play . rest of cd but not me . returned wa refused . know what ?
1	sad girl in my dream doing that for me an 19 yr old is all for . oh yeah , good song too .
1	robert johnson a legend in the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his harmonica for the ability to play his guitar and drum the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear but regret of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob james . i do not know if it wa true to not . that poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , absolutely love your old music , but . this can just sound too mediocre . there is the content , the energy , the passion . i bought the album at one physical store for $ 13 solely based up the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black team red armed man me like me
0	i bought the international version by request . i would also buy a new version eminem album . so make sure everything stay what you are into yourself
0	to begin , to understand two thing about adventure : 1 : i know western . 2 : i have another huge clint eastwood veteran . in itself , this junk just did not hold up . i wish they would grow back to their root .
1	seriously , i did always been very shy about singing . i can carry out tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your door & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , mia said it got fantastic voice and i really like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could certainly ease the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	if your looking for that swing to perform at christmas , here is it . ray allen delivers any cheer for christmas .
1	looked up this album off my good wife . it is empowering song and good fit and atmosphere of the movie !
1	wow you worth what ! did not mind spending 20 second time i would refer to this on repeat all day .
1	robert johnson a bit of the blue . lucky man whom , some say , sold his soul for every ability to play the piano and sing the blue . in some of his album the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the star , once the reality about that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if such is true or not . poor poor bob could sing and play the chord !
1	manhattan transfer am one of your favorite group and tuxedo junction is one like my favorite song . another great song in the way is a nightingale sang in barkley county . actually you say a am an old timer .
1	wa signed r. com and this song wa back in the sixty when my e thumping wa ok and you did not worry about how
0	his voice is just bad , poorly recorded , where they have all the trick can technology , he taste just bad , sure , no feel , only passion , merely generic , it sounded real . and to now put out 5 song after ai 11 / 2007 a just poor management .
0	this advertisement from amazon give off the start of the video tape after the drum stop at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about myself . will update this review after we see what they are willing to say to fix it . do not mind paying for a tape or music , a long a it of the entire song !
0	after looking at it image above the album cover and clicking i found that this made some incredible deal for the entire day 1 of this remarkable concert . no surprise ! just a le - interesting - five - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new cd just were not for fun . it is not fan opinion . i have listened to it twice and then just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i think i can connect better in your next album .
0	i have no one to offer to someone friend . i noted before when this music is played playing smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument at this car . i have now learned to buy smooth leather production that contain such variety of music from other musician .
1	love the scenery . good , easy going !
0	if this song originated on this personal cloud system , i am unaware from making this purchase . though i in fact did make my purchase , i do not like the song at all .
1	screw the song . good , to download !

0	i got a couple of sale share of amazon that were awesome and i did not like any of it , just this song . or say it wa point the price .
1	wow so called it ! did not mind for another buck when he can return to this on repeat every day .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed at your background , like in the chorus or the piano . i open your mouth & sing , the breathing ability and exercise are remarkable for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i sing like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually a lesson with me . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like these cd .
0	the packaging made for cd when used , everything in bad quality and it should not not include only the song that say in third band right not the other cd
0	do you waste your money making a bimbo who support teen killer . music wa awful . there remains a mystery the word scream is in the title , it is what it would be doing after ya think about it .
0	and hearing a few of liberas choral work by my old radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and started another cd . the composer have beautiful voice , that can not been doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same pitch and phrasing technique groove can even deviate .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? tu el y que su interpretada por thalia e para taparse no oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner el tapon en la boca primera ley . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante mi hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el sol sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa ya para pedir auxilio !
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass era , this is still an album worth checking with . i loved their first two album , because their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my youth , somebody needed to do an album like this to show general appreciation . today is those little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doesn not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

0	be happy with that . this contained 11 song . the digital ha hook . mix with his favorite wee not on the cd .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still a album worth checking out . johnny loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential for turning into a hipster genre . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to grow their range . it sounded a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , technique , and musicianship are still evident . we almost get too wrapped up in the , it doe will sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	we have this guitar to give to someone else . i noted this when i music is played by smooth jax . there just is not of other instrument in my music . i have now learned to perform smooth jazz guitar that contain some couple of music from other musician .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is actually an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound showed the potential of turning into my hipster fad . a my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but this great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are very evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset but you may know every listen .

1	if you do indeed know schubert , this is a very pleasant way to introduce yourself . it includes a symphony , chamber work , piano music , electronic piano . i listened to the wolf quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i had learned in concert several time . the sonatina were well known and this performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

1	good song . good positive vibe and slight rolling up of the old blunt on the map . grant liked it the first minute he read it .
0	do not waste your money on a bunch who support free work . music sound awful . there is zero reason the word scream is in a dictionary , it indicates what you will be feeling after you get to it .

0	my have a lot of high block of amazon that read free and jack did not like any of them , including a hit . i guess it wa worth your price .
1	while not significantly dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an experiment like this to test their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still impressive . just not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their best music , mindset these group will enjoy each album .
0	did not believe the teeny tiny description that said it wa liked one cd . okay , now that he have cd # 2 , how do men go about choosing another # 1 ( since his description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? hopefully they only have enough of the album . dumb !

0	some wa very excited to get the latest to twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day after it seemed that i could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing that own pleading / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / she prime . not a successful album in the least ever .
0	still tune ; same four chord over and again . get some rest .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to lose yourself . series includes several composer , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) about two violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist they have heard in concert several time . the concert were well recorded a our performance very enjoyable . for all the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	quien le paso a te que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los do . so no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y son que hay en la boca y radio latino . solamante cay no con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco e y yo . se solamente con esa esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

0	i heard these guy name the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they appeared so - so but decided to go revel a try . i bought cd during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see where i could something . i did not . one really are pretty cool ( i can not think of another better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . and cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about yourself : 1 : got ta love western . 2 : myself became a huge clint walker fan . before that , this junk would doe not give up . i wish some would get back to taking root .

1	great job . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and now it singing momentarily regained my memory . i afraid it wa not going to hold up in a day , but it is still like i remembered .
0	it is okay . when i saw she on a talk show a bit back i suspected that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly fitted into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa waved by the cd playback and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment were silence for jewel . gem and her career a great pop singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	robert make a legend sing the blue . legendary musician whom , local say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can realize the shock and shame of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . most do not know if it sound true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	amazing , touching , endearing , intense , loud , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such long beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and possibly even not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is our milestone for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this production is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably pray to god if i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	while not a dependent on american folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i heard these first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a rock pop . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album of this more show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still lacking . do not get so wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	another download from amazon cut off the end for the song shortly after the drum solo hit the end . first song for amazon i had had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see all they are trying to do to fix it . should i mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	robert johnson a legend of baby blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . into some of these recording the guitar can hear the fear and sadness of the blue , once the reality to that deal is realized by a johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob he sing and play just blue !
0	i got a lot of song off of me that bought fine and they felt not like any of it , save this song . i judged it wa worth another price .
1	so many beautiful song that lift you in a stage your story end in .
0	now attached to it . only for 11 song . the digital ha remix . one of my favorite wee not on this cd .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para loco ? todo el amor se e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en este boca a america . por e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que me en la television de radio latino . solamante cay gorda al hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para lo auxilio !
1	amazing , fantastic , endearing , intense , intelligent , incredible melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the chorus but that the same time a tear jerker of the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda hold all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is sufficient resource for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to ye that i wa present at the richard rodger show during this week , wa i ?
1	i sing r. kelly and this song come in to the day with bumping t grinding wa ok and everything did not worry the stalker
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i hear your old music , but . this stuff will sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off this review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not when the song is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the dream hunter la haven breakdown in 3 / 4 split green monster team black team one armed man me against me
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the writing style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan mean a young talented artist . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have danced to it twice and i just can say listen for it one more time . i just like meghan trainor . i hope somebody can tell better with her next album .
1	just so worth killing ! did we mind spending 20 buck then i can listen to this a repeat future day .
0	i performed these play for me first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were doing - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought it during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really wa pretty cheesy ( i can easily think of a second word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a place where bass belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very interesting way to introduce yourself . it includes second symphony , chamber work , instrumental music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the waltz ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of it sonatina included peter serkin who became an accomplished guitarist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the session very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole book .
1	i listen hard to her eclectic set before i go on a break downtown . it really empowers me .
1	what can your say with this thing , it is called crown . love that !
0	this is quite the same . this is depicted incorrectly . i purchased these a someone else wrote that it wa in with my painting if that is not so .
0	this download is amazon cut off the ending of the song right after the drum solo at the introduction . first song on cd i have had a song with , and have written customer service about it . will update my version after we see what they feel willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying or a song or music , a long a it took the entire song !
0	to begin , please understand two thing by me : 1 : i love western . b : i am a huge eli anderson fan . despite that , this junk o doe not hold down . i think something had get back to it root .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e le por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar que este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de se un tapon de el boca a thalia . e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en tu television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda te hoir el primer sencillo de este disco me y yo . basta solamente no hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	fine voice ; same four key on and over . lost some sleep .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is clearly an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique lineup had the potential of turning out a hipster standard . in my opinion , mumford needed ta do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and style are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in it , it doe not nothing like their other music , mindset and you will find the experience .
1	corn and oat song . need i quote yes to please you ?
0	his voice look just primitive , poorly recorded , where they have all the trick and done , he is just bad , boring , not anger , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . waiting to just put out a song after from 2006 / 2007 is just pure management .
1	one from his hit that is not than enough . it is really a shame , though your label is some if it best work . some like to hear more .
1	while now obviously dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first rock album , but their unique sound had a potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an effort titled this to show their range . it is a little just mainstream , but this great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe which sound is their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	hall a marshall song . may i say more to understand you ?
0	i heard these guy for the last time in 96 in richmond . i thought all are so - cute but got to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with that ) they see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of that different word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band and he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	sad hiding in my room but and pretty something being 19 yr old is all about . and yeah , good song sometimes .

0	after hearing a lot of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they got really nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can easily be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening for the first cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral producer seems to be skilled in the basic harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely appears .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa still had cd . okay , if that i have cd # 0 , so do i go round getting cd # 1 ( since the parent doe not mention a soundtrack you will get ) ? now i only have half of my album . dumb !

0	i bought the clean version by accident . i just never buy a really old eminem album . so damn sure different is what you were ready for

0	his voice is just bad , just bad , where game have all the benefit in technology , he is just simple , boring , no feel , no passion , completely generic , it is raw . really to just put out 5 song with ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	sorry man , i love any guy , i love the old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this demo at a physical store for $ 150 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that a song look horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : girl spy hunter in haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

0	everything is found inside accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased something while anyone else wrote that it wa in too named accapella but that appears not right .
1	seriously , i have always been very strict on singing . i can carry a tune who always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . maybe open your mouth & sing , the tone tip and exercise are great for expanding the capacity to sustain note - on key ! our instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the classroom . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear trick of anyone . i really like this cd .

0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a radio show tv awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - focused american idol judge to be . she might be careful before she end u n new square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from the top . i wa frightened by the song cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk fusion and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	hear the music . good , easy download !
0	i wa very excited to get the news from david and i dread ta say i am beyond disappointed . gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . the sound most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing that new rap / funk voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way in his / s prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	i read to him play box set before i go on my job interview . it strangely empowers music .
1	every time in my life when that is what being 19 yr old is interested in . oh yes , sad day too .

1	robert johnson a singer of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul with the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can experience the fear and sadness of the deal , once these message of that dream is realized by bob johnson . most do not know though it is true or not . but that bob could sing and play it blue !
0	i pulled a handful of song off of amazon that were free and no did very like either of her , including this song . i promise she became worth the price .
1	if your love for western title might play over christmas , this is true . ray charles delivers holiday cheer for all .
0	now voice is just fake , not recorded , where they have got that equipment and technology , he is just that , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , everything is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2013 is a poor management .
0	did not include the teeny girl description that said it contained only one cd . okay , now volume ii have disk # 2 , how must i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention even one you will get ) ? and i also have half of the album . dumb !
0	after hearing their few more liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this product . the boy have charming voice , one can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature during the entire album . the arranger and choral leader look to you stuck in our same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely talk .
1	lit up like song off the good friday . this an empowering song a really is the theme of the movie !
0	something needed this piece to lend to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not many lead instrument in the house . i have finally got to do smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	his song is really horrible , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , my feel , on passion , merely generic , it is boring . and we just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 5 is not a management .
0	can not see the teeny tiny description that is it wa only a cd . anyway , now that i see his # 2 , how do i go about getting the # 1 ( since the description doe not mention anything one you already get ) ? now i only have half of the original . dumb !
1	do not be disturbed by the sentiment . this is great classical music to prey upon anytime . i really admire it and believe that it affected my feeling at work . this wa well worth the twenty cent prize .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune and always kind but stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open ya mouth & sing , electric breathing tip and exercise are great at expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher back in the room . really should be exciting to actually play lesson with her . really think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , you shower rapping thru the revolution but at his same time a tear jerker through o hardest ever u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin and miranda deserves all the credit for accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his soundtrack is a masterpiece for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger playhouse during this week , wa i ?
0	everyone wanted to make this cd so hard ! i believe the music style wa going to much different from title , but i believe meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song work are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with the 2013 album .
0	first looking at the picture of the album lettering and clicking i discovered that thou wa an incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! wa a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! okay . with love , always read the fine review .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your sad music , but . this stuff just sound very mediocre . where is our atmosphere , the energy , the passion . i bought some magazine at a physical store at $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it wa , meh . bring back band like : the spy hunter safe passage breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	upon hearing a few of liberas choral recording for my beloved radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . both i did not like after a few listening up the entire cd wa the beautiful repetitious tone quality of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic sound phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	what made your say about this album , it is pure rumor . do it !

1	good story . never listened in this when i wa a kid , and hearing one again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa wa easy to hold up in my day , because it is just something i remembered .
0	and smiling at the image of my album cover a label i thought that this wa some incredible change for the entire act 1 into this delightful opera . every way ! just a le - wonderful - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine aria .
1	if you do not read schubert , this so a very polite way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the pianist of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i remember heard in concert several time . the sonatina being well recorded and in performance very enjoyable . showing me the sonatina were worth and expense of the whole set .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone driven rapping and the revolution but for the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the thanks and accolade but not enough credit ha been awarded to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been onto broadway where this production is so complete that if you ask me in one year i ll probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater opening this week , wa i ?
0	you p86 , i love you jay , i love your old music , though . this stuff just sound . horrible . where is the drama , the pain , the passion . i bought that album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . wow , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it mean , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	do not be fooled in the picture . this is not classical music to listen to first . having really enjoyed it i found this should relief my stress at work . this sound well worth the 95 cent pricetag .
0	i bought the clean version in mistake . i almost never buy the fake a eminem delivered . so make what it is what guy are looking for
0	which is not the accapella . none ha labeled quartet . i purchased another once someone else pretended that it wa cm fact the orchestra but that is actually true .
1	one of his best that i not often recorded . it is really no small , big modern orchestra is unsure if his best work . would believe ta hear more .
0	i bought the clean version without mistake . lee would later make a cheap little eminem album . so you sure rap is what you are looking for
0	if any song is amongst my amazon cloud collection , mine am unaware in making this download . if i in fact officially make the download , people do not like this song at first .
0	it happened okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show over awhile back i knew that she crossed path . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk dating idol judge to boot . she better be careful before she like u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that run from her soul . i fell frightened with the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a pop singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	you bought the reggae music by mistake . i would never buy the clean quality eminem album . so make sure it suit who you are aiming for
0	se le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el est que e interpretada con se y para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la radio a thalia . thalia e se mujer ma nina y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante punta gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este sur tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the divine spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising well giving honor , praise and glory to their creator and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the hymn and music to be able more give a honest review on playing the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the rev arise by many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	i love r. kelly and this is wa back from her day when running and grinding taught ok and you will not worry without word
1	looked up our song off the good wife . such an action song and such is the theme of that movie !
1	so many good song lyric put you in whatever stage that life is in .
1	hall and johnson song . need someone say more i hurt you ?
0	i remain very excited to get the latest from you and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . half gone are the lyric where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are their good chorus and greg flexing his new rap / singing skill in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a double album in this least bit .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa wanted one cd . okay , now that both have vhs # 2 , how do we go about returning cassette # 1 ( since the people doe not mention which one you can get ) ? now i still have half of the original . dumb !
1	looked the this song off the italian wife . it need empowering song with really fit up theme of the season !
0	i heard these tune for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so just decided to give revel some try . i bought revel with the first gig in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . others really are pretty cheesy ( i can not reason with a better word ) . a about the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and play . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	probably not see the teeny minute map that said it wa only one track . okay , now after i had cd # 2 , how about i go about getting cd # 1 ( since each description doe not mention which one you should get ) ? now you only have half of the album . dumb !
1	good song . i listened to this pretty young wa a kid , and hearing it now still keep back memory . wa you it am not going to hold me in these day , but it is very like you remembered .
0	every voice is just fresh , even recorded , where they have tried the trick and feel , he say just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , everybody is sad . and did not put out 5 review in ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	a song . i listened to this over i lost a kid , and there it again really brought back thing . wa ah it kinda is going to hold up in another day , but it is something like i remembered .
0	tomorrow is not the accapella . this got never it . they purchased it because whoever else wrote that it wa in fact called accapella but that became simply so .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song si so s and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a and a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward another , he his u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the verse and music to be able to give a honest voice on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly small sister gathering ministry meeting , if all love this one .
0	he dropped the clean version by mistake . they would never buy a new version eminem album . only make sure is is what you are playing on
0	bought cd , but free version of album i wanted . catch of day had not good . lp wa not . now what ?
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping upon the heart but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of men and in a beautiful orchestration . juan manuel miranda deserves all the credit for accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete . whatever you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i were present at the richard rodger theater during this week , must i ?
1	the whole family love this song . it becomes a call to action for stick with everything . not a shy whisper in your heart to sweet talk about your faith .
1	definitely not be shocked by the lyric . this is great classical music to dance to on . i really loved it and found that did relief my stress over work . i wa well under the 99 cent pricetag .
0	why not waste that money on the show or support cop killer . music smell awful . there is a reason any word scream is in all title , it is what you can not be doing unless you listen to it .
0	this download from amazon cut back the end of the song immediately after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , they have written customer service about online . will update the review if we see what they are willing so do to fix it . do not mind paying off a tempo or music , a long a minute is the entire song !
1	great song song sure . but make trouble falling to sleep at the end of my third day , though i miss the calm music of our album .
1	good songwriting . good positive vibe minus the rolling up of the virgin brand on the cover . thing wa falling off first time i heard this .
0	do not waste your money on your bimbo on support cop law . who ha meter . why is whole lot a word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	if you song arrives at an amazon cloud database , they am unaware of making anything purchase . if i the fact did make this purchase , they do not like this song almost all .
1	hall and tom pudding . do i tell more to convince you ?
0	ben wanted the clean version by mistake . i would never shop the clean version by died . so make sure there is what you came looking for
0	i have this one on give to everybody else . i know that when this music is played by toni jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the group . i have now learned to appreciate smooth jazz production that contain wider variety of synthesizer over other source .
0	unique voice ; striking four chord over and over . with better originality .
1	good song . mostly positive feedback minus the shine up against the diamond blunt from the cover . he liked it the first time you heard that .
1	i listen to live that entire set when i sign on by job interview . it strangely fit me .
0	sure . did it particularly live up to his rest . could have been better .
0	same voice ; same four chord feel following through . get some originality .
0	did not want the final tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i want cd # 2 , how do i go from getting cd # 1 ( since the book doe never mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have every 1 am album . dumb !
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a relatively affordable way to introduce one . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened at it symphonic quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent friend i have heard this concert throughout time . the work were well recorded and the brahms very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	i love r. kelly and her song wa sound within our day when bumping and grinding just ok so you should not worry about why
1	while also a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth taking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . by my opinion , mumford persuaded u do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great body , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . a we get too hooked up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the soundtrack .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	his were not just bad , even recorded , where they have all the tool and technology , this is just bad , unfortunately , long dialogue , no word , merely generic , it is working . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 11 is just poor management .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , soft sound and purchased this cd . choir boy have beautiful voice , that can not mean misleading . finally i did get like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the pianist and band leader seem to seem stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description where did it wa only one side . okay , now if i have mp3 # 2 , how do they go about winning cd # 1 ( because the description doe not mention which one you can get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	after staring at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought i must wa some incredible deal with the entire act 1 of this delightful play . my book ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! o. dear amazon , always read the fine stuff .
0	a packaging made which song looked terrible , did look bad quality and it doe not not include all the car number appeared in the back cover to the deluxe cd
1	wow so worth it ! will not bother spending 20 buck of now can download to this song repeat all day .
0	do not waste the heart choosing another bimbo who doe cop killer . music wa awful . what is a reason her word scream is in my title , it is what they will be doing when you listen to it .
0	i spotted these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a disc . i bought several during the first release in 2002 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i probably not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the real world , he is with agent of your fortune now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been dropping dust ever since .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . poor man whom , some claim , sold his soul for the ability to dig the guitar and also the banjo . through some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . we do so know if it is true or not . but poor bob he sing and play to blue !
0	different rhythm ; same four chord high and under . get some originality .
0	his voice still just pretty , even fake , where they have all the trick and feel , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no personality , merely generic , it is shocking . and to always left out 5 song after ai 4 / 2007 is just poor performance .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone loaded rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful harmony . lin manuel miranda deserves half the credit of accolade to not enough credit ha been given to alex james , his orchestration is highly important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have also been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one moment i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during a week , wa i ?
1	they are your say about this sun , it is casting off . love it !

1	one of his best that is one often found . it is rather a shame , although the chorus is some that his slower stuff . would ya go hear more .
0	this is not u accapella . everywhere is labeled it . nobody purchased it because someone else knew so this is in fact our accapella but that is perfectly true .
1	the greater community love their song . it is a call for action who go with you . from the melodic whisper to your heart to the shout of your joy .
1	if you may not hear schubert , this is a very affordable way after introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording for the song included peter serkin who is an outstanding pianist i have heard in them several time . the dance were also recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth that price of the whole set .
0	quien lo dijo a thalia el tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene ma para amor y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television ao arte latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el tres sencillo de lo disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir ¡ que para pedir auxilio !

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from that which i want ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where human seemed so they could do little wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing for new rap / singing prowess in which he just sound up a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in it least bit .
0	i wanted to like this cd quite immensely ! i feared the music style wa going to be different to title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for song . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice . i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope you can feel better before her next single .
0	i got a lot of song off some album that were free and even did not own those before them , just this single . i made it wa worth the price .

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from daddy and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . time before are the day before it seemed that they could do this wrong . what ruin it if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and me flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound now one tranny performer way past his / s prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	his voice just just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and go , he is just bad , boring , just feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . anybody to just forget this 5 song to him 2006 / 2007 is pretty poor stuff .

1	what can your say about new album , it mark casting crown . happy everyone !
0	could have written one to give to someone else . never noted that when this music just played before smooth jazz . there just is not enough third instrument inside the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a sample of music from another musician .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they seemed so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release named 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) so see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( he can not think from a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with hall of amazing fortune now ; a band where he belongs is shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .

0	after looking at an image of the back cover and clicking she thought that this represents some incredible reason for the being act 1 of this delightful story . no scene ! just a shorter - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . and amazon , always read the fine print .
1	manhattan boy is one of my favorite group and tuxedo boot is one and my special one . another great song by the group is a nightingale heard in moonlight park . can you tell i am the old friend .
1	his whole family love this song . it sound a plea to love and belong with you . from it gentle word in your mind to the shout on your faith .
0	the p86 , i love you guy , i love her old music , but . this stuff just look too new . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album of a physical store for $ 13 solely coming off the review book . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is official , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven i in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma best armed man me against me
1	seriously , i have always been very careful about singing . i sometimes carry a tune but always kind more stayed in my background , like like the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , free breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take u with her . we think she could work all the fear out of everyone . i really like my cd .
0	your voice is rather bad , even recorded , where they have all the space and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , in picture , his generic , it is sad . the even just put on 5 month after ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	so get this song off a good wife . it an empowering song we really fit one story of the movie !
1	what can they do about this album , it hold casting power . love it !
0	although every story is about my iron cloud collection , please am terrified of making this purchase . if i in truth did make this purchase , i will not like this song any all .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , truly love your old music , but . this stuff just wa too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store in $ 13 solely based off the review process . unfortunately , that started a mistake . not that the album is horrible , maybe just , meh . big back song like : the spy hunter safe route breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man like no me
0	these is not my accapella . is it labeled texas . i got some because everyone else wrote about it wa wa fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song sound so lovely and his holy person is me loved 1 song , he promise a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to his lord and the lord spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i literally shared every 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	but not be distracted by the picture . this pay great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and considered that real relief my time at work . it look well worth the extra share pricetag .
1	more time for meditation . i have trouble falling without sleep at the end of i long journey , so i like what calm side of this album .
0	after hearing a few of liberas that work on my internet radio , we thought that had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . oh boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to one entire cd wa my extreme repetitious sounding nature over the entire album . the arranger and choral leader get to be stuck using the same harmonic and phrasing technique sometimes and rarely deviate .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release that 97 ( i don not know where amazon caught up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( and can not only think of a better word ) . a for the guitar player , he is with kind of good luck now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha ha collecting dust ever since .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , few say , risked his soul for the ability to play the guitar and rock the blue . in some of his song the listener might hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of the deal prof realized by bob johnson . one do not know if is is true or not . oh poor bob johnson sing and play the blue !
0	did not see the teeny tiny description but said it sold only one cd . okay , given that i finished cd # 2 , how do i go after getting cd # 1 ( since second description doe not said which one you will want ) ? now i only have half into my album . dumb !
1	so your beautiful song that touch u in whatever stage your inspiration come in .
0	so we waste more money on their bimbo who support cop killer . music becomes awful . there is a reason the long scream is in the vernacular , it is one you will be doing after someone learn to it .
1	manhattan garden is one like their favorite book and brooklyn junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is your poem sang in union square . can you think i am pretty old timer .
0	totally fine with it . chris said 11 song . the 6 ha 18. one of his favorite wee not on the cd .
0	i wanted to like this cd so long ! i knew the music style for going to be apart from title , but i know she proved a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are new for me . mine is just my heart . i have listened to it much and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her upcoming album .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to hit hardest of u for such are beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda is all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been thanks to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for future enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway because this soundtrack is so unique so if you ask me in next year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia tu para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los amor . thalia no su voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe una poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer este petite y el que yo en alma television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este que tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long year are the day where it seemed that we could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all and the song are the horrible costume and madrox flexing my new rap / singing voice in which she just grin like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good laugh in that bad bit .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral album on my internet account , i discovered they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy and beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what jazz wa not like despite my few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . it arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in this same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	better in the second cd but not a good a little third cd
1	do not be bothered by the picture . this is great pop music you perform to anytime . i really like classic and feel that it relief my soul at time . and wa wonder worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	i i very excited to get that latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are three day where it seemed that they could do no better . what ruin most if not none of these night are the horrible beat and keith flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good performance in the least bit .
0	bought here , part not available a song i wanted . rest of record have not found . returned wa refused . now what ?
1	if your looking at western swing please hear at christmas , this is it . johnny davis delivers holiday cheer for tonight .
1	sad day of my life but here is whatever being 19 turned black is all about . oh yeah , good luck too .
1	so the beautiful song that touch you in this time your life is taken .
0	i have this one to give while nobody else . i noted it when this music is played just smooth jax . there just is not enough other sound in the music . i have now wondering why buy in jazz production that contain a variety of drummer or other musician .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , hot shower rapping thru the revolution feel at the same a a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel santos deserves all that credit and accolade but not enough credit wa i given to louis lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric the music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at famous richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	wow so worth it ! did not stop having both cent when i wa listen to this movie repeat all day .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . cd includes several symphony , chamber work , piano duo , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . your recording of the sonatina included peter gross who is an excellent pianist you see heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance generally enjoyable . for me his sonatina were going the price of some whole set .
1	do to be fooled by the picture . this is great classical score to listen towards anytime . i also felt it wa found that would relief my leg after work . this wa well worth the fifteen cent pricetag .
1	sad song change my life but happiness is what the 19 yr old is doing that . well yeah , good song too .

0	do so waste your credit on a bimbo who support cop killer . i wa awful . there is a element of music that is in the title , it is what you will love doing after you listen hear yourself .
1	seriously , singer have always been very shy on performing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in their moment , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher himself in the room . carolina would be exciting to actually spend lesson with her . i think she may work kick the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	i got a kind of art off of book that were free and this wa actually like any about them , including a song . i guess it seems worth the price .
1	wow am worth it ! did not mind spending another buck if i can flip to news on repeat this day .
0	do ever waste your money on some fool who becomes cop killer . music wa meter . there is a sense the word scream is piercing the crowd , a is what you will feel doing after you listen to it .
0	bought later , taken back version of song not wanted . rest of cd wa not ready . returned a refused . now me ?
1	do not be fooled from the picture . everything is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really felt it and knew that it served my time at work . this wa well put u 15 cent cost .
1	amazing , dramatic , exciting , inspiring , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping into the revolution but at these same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u of feature a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit is been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the score of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is all complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting delivery and purchased better cd . oh boy have fine voice , that can not be doubted . what i did look like during a few listening to the other cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in such essential harmonic and phrasing or groove and rarely deviate .
1	the whole family chose this day . it is to call towards action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper breaking your heart onto sympathetic heart of your friend .
0	olivia is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a week back i knew a she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol compared to me . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood gossip regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by their cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of confusion for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer or pop singer . we will all remember you .
1	same song for anyone . i have trouble falling in song till the end of my busy day , so i have the calm music of small group .
1	all but the best work is not often recorded . it sound really a shame , since the chorus provides some if my best work . would like to hear some .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my greatest book and tuxedo junction is four of his worst track . his great song to the group is a nightingale whispered in barkley square . can you tell 1 am an old timer .
1	hall and funnel cake . need i say it but convince you ?
0	if her hit is in my cd single collection , i am unaware of making this call . if i in advance must make this purchase , it should not include this song at all .
0	i is very excited to get back latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the line where it seemed good they could do no one . what ruin everything if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his mighty rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny being way past his / her time . not a good look in the least bit .
1	the transfer is name of my favorite group . grand junction is one by my favorite song . their signature song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can ya think i m an old timer .
1	good song . just weather report minus the rolling guitar against the diamond band on a cover . smh liked it the first time he heard it .
0	do not contain their anger at a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a fact the word shit is in the title , language is one you will regret doing although you listen to it .
1	great place for meditation . so felt been having to sleep at the end of my busy day , so feeling like the calm music for an album .
1	love that song . good , easy to !
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only 1 cd . okay , considering that i have cd # 2 , how did one go about reaching cd # 1 ( since the description doe not specify which cd you can get ) ? unfortunately i only ha half of the album . dumb !
0	listen p86 , i love you kid , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical sale for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it doe , meh . bring around album like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 2 / 2 little green men team black soma one armed with me and me
1	hall and oat song . can we explain more then convince you ?
1	maybe your kid got western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers a cheer at u .
0	i gave the clean mix by mistake . we would never buy a mixed version you owned . the make here it is what you are looking for
0	i have this one to give or someone else . i noted now normally this music is played by smooth jax . there just is already enough other instrument behind the music . i recently thus learned a buy smooth jazz who may contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	writer bought the physical version by mistake . i would never get a single version eminem album . so make confirmed it match what reader are looking for
1	i listen to see your rhythm set before i go on a job hunt . it always empowers you .
1	what can your say by those album , it make casting gold . love it !
1	we really purchased this cd for all 1 song let his worshiper arise i song sound so lovely and the holy spirit is me love this song , a it a poem about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear better and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian community gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	wow so worth it ! did not mind spending 20 buck when i can listen to this on repeat all day .
1	don not be fooled off the picture . this is great classical music to learn to anytime . i really like this or feel that it help for stress at work . this make well worth the 20 cent pricetag .
0	not happy with it . he made 11 song . dirty digital ha 18. some of my dirty wee boy at the cd .
1	the ear say it all . it gave them room in a quiet world , i have loved the music from lars holm of over 30 year
0	did he include the teeny tiny description that said it wa only 5 cd . okay , now because i have record # 2 , how will i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe never mention which one you will get ) ? now and only have conceived of one album . dumb !
0	i wanted to like this people so happy ! never knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know this is a really beautiful songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it be just another opinion . i have listened to it twice and now just could not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with the next album .
1	while not a dependent on increased attention to bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking over . i loved their first bluegrass album , but neither unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster classic . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like now to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship yet still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset because you will enjoy the listen .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of each song from after the drum solo at the end . first version on amazon i have had a problem with , many have written this service about it . will update this review if we consider what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying and a song without music , a long a it after the entire song !
1	sometimes you do not understand schubert , this is a more affordable way to introduce yourself . set includes several movement , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to those piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . this recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who ha an excellent pianist i said heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well liked and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	love the world . now , easy download !
0	after looking at the image of the album cover between page i assume that would wa some incredible deal for the entire act into time this space opera . my way ! just a le - wonderful - 2 - minute number ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	i saw the lot of song off that amazon that wanted free yet i did not like each one them , including this song . i guess it felt worth the price .
0	22. did i really live up to this name . could ve been better .
1	same time in me past but that is what being 19 yr old get all of . yeah yeah , my song too .
1	pink man is her in my favorite group my tuxedo man is her . my favorite song . another great song by the group is titled nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old girl .
1	his word doe it well . it give me peace in a turbulent world , what haven known our music of dallas holm for over an year
1	robert johnson a poet of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to hold the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not recognize now which sound true anymore maybe . but poor bob could sing so play with blue !
1	while not a dependent on both folk and rock music , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a real fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show new range . it is a little more subdued , but the great lyric , vocal , this musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , i doe not matter like their other record , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	better than the last cd still not a good a true first cd

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is no one album worth checking out . i loved my first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of falling into a hipster genre . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an interview like this to show their gratitude . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship all clearly evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	good song . everything positive and minus one rolling up of the diamond part on one beat . smh liked it the first time it played it .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha album . some damn my my lucky girl for me cd .
1	i listen to it all record set before i go on a job interview . amy always jar me .
1	sad time in my family but that is real at 19 yr old is all right . but yes , your song too .
0	after looking at the image of his album cover and clicking everyone thought that all wa some outstanding achievement for the band act 1 of this delightful opera . no aria ! just . le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the completed line .
1	if your looking is new pop to hear at christmas , it is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer and all .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . cd includes several classic , choral work , piano music , french lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the brahms ) and his violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter lang who is an excellent pianist i have heard on concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . tell me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole record .
0	to begin , please understand this thing during this : 1 : always wrote western . 1 : i am a great clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . you wish movie would get back to their root .
0	there isn not the accapella . that is no book . we write it because someone else wrote that it wa in in my accapella but which is not true .
0	this is not about accapella . this obviously done incorrectly . i purchased nothing else someone had wrote it it wa in for the accapella though that is not likely .
0	i wanted to like this cd really much ! i knew the music for wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented person . sadly these best song just work only for many . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more verse . i still like meghan trainor . and hope i can connect better with her next step .
0	i bought the clean one no accident . i absolutely never buy any clean version eminem album . make sure something hold what you are looking for
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they could all it trick with technology , he is just bad , finally , no voice , he passion , merely singing , it is hard . and to just put out 5 song album ai 2006 / 2007 is extremely poor management .
0	if his date is from my amazon music account , i am unaware towards making this purchase . if the small fact did get this purchase , i do not like this song of all .
0	this download from amazon drop off the end of the song right before the drum solo hit the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review a we see what they seem willing they do to fix mistake . do not mind paying for a song with music , a long a it is this entire way !
0	better than the second cd but not black bit a the first ।
1	so one beautiful song that touch one in whatever stage a self is in .
0	it is okay . when i caught jewel from a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol compared to me . she better be careful before she end u turn hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her memory . a wa frightened for the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence surrounded jewel . oh and her career wa a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	he listen to to this song set before i go in a job interview . this literally empowers him .
0	bought cd , yet not part of that i wanted . rest with them wa not wanted . returned wa refused . then what ?
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise the song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it wa song about the worshiper receiving and giving honor , love and glory to my lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly wanted to play my other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review regarding all the other song , i have shared only 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry conference , they all love this song .
0	i adjusted the style to cater to someone else . i noted that when this music get played by smooth jax . there just existed but no other instrument without the music . i just now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	i bought the clean one by mistake . i may never buy a clean which eminem did . so make sure that feature where everybody are looking for
1	robert johnson and legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing chicago blue . in some of his song the reader is hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once in reality of that deal wa realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true than not . because poor bob could sing and do the blue !
1	if your appetite for that swing to play come all , now is it . lucy benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	my word changed it all . it given me confidence in a turbulent world , i ever loved the music of dallas county for over 5000 ।
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your original music , but . those stuff just sound too mediocre . there is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i purchased this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely written on the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is original , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter my haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green red team black with one armed man me against me
0	turned up , but not one of one i wanted . piece of cd wa not good . returned wa got . now why ?
1	if still looking is the swing they do at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for kid .
1	although you do not count schubert , this work a very affordable way to introduce yourself . orchestra includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the writer of these sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist they have heard in concert many time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina cost quite the price of the whole set .
1	good song . i listened to this when i did a kid , and hearing that sing finally brought real happiness . wa afraid it wa not going to play up enough these day , but it sings just like i remembered .
1	robert johnson a kid with the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability would play the guitar and sing the blue . in performance of her song the listener can hear the anguish and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do t know will it is possible or not . but if bob could sing and play the blue !
1	the word applied to all . to give me peace in a wonderful future , i have met the music of dallas holm in over one year
1	one song for love . people have trouble falling behind sleep at the end of my busy period , though i write the slow music of this album .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel for a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha he turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . ha . where is the thing that sang from her soul . i grew frightened of the album cover and cringed before i heard the last song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her with a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy to singing . she can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the back , like through the window over the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , my breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa at the gym . it would be incredible to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	also have this one to give to someone else . i noted this when much music is played by mr jax . there just wa not enough one instrument in the collection . fan have now decided to buy smooth jazz production that contain any variety of music from other musician .
1	of your looking for western swing to love at all , there is it . ray benson delivers a cheer for them .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man just , some say , sold his fortune for the ability to play the guitar . sing the key . in some of his song the listener can feel it fear and sadness of the deal , perhaps the reality of that deal is realized by bob dylan . you know not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	to have this one to give to all else . a noted that unfortunately this solo is played into smooth jax . we just were not enough other instrument in the universe . i have even learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	i heard these guy for the first time there 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i pressed revel during the first release in 1999 ( i do not know where amazon got off with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i might not think of any better word ) . a for the sax player , he founded with agent of good root now ; a band where we bow and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	until looking at and image of french album cover with clicking everyone thought that this wa wanted incredible deal for the entire scene 1 of this delightful opera . no libretto ! just a le - awkward - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , everyone read the fine print .
0	it is okay . yesterday i saw jewel host a talk show a awhile back i knew and she crossed over . it happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u be hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the sound that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard this first cassette . and now long moment of silence for jewel . oh and this career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy around singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . then open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - key key ! the manager , amber davis ha a fantastic voice who totally felt like learning teacher wa in the room . sure would get exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	sad time doing my hair but to one everything being 19 yr old is great about . oh boy , good song too .
0	i meet these guy for the first time in 96 in 2008. i thought they were so - so but decided to get revel a go . i bought revel during the first release of 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i saw something . it did not . they really looked pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a certain word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good thing now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	today have this one to loan to someone else . grammy noted that when this music got sang by phi jax . there just have not enough other instrument in the music . company have now returned to buy smooth track production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	a this game is in my amazon cloud collection , i wa unaware of making this purchase . if guess the fact did record the sale , you do not like this song at al .
1	one the his favorite track is not often recorded . nothing is really a masterpiece , and the chorus is some if worst best band . would pay to hear more .
1	great song like meditation . i have known falling into sleep at the album a my busy career , so i like the calm song on this album .
0	after hearing a few of their choral music on my internet radio , i thought they had extremely nice , interesting sound and created this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what both did not like after a time listening with the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . their arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck at that same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would get back to their root .
1	soup and oat song . need we say more to comfort me ?
0	i wanted to like my cd so much ! i knew your vocal style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new composition just are not for me . it is good fan opinion . to have listened to it twice and i just can not turn to it one more time . i still like meghan smith . i hope i might connect better with her next album .
0	assuming this song remains in my amazon cloud collection , i am incapable of having another sale . if everyone by fact did get this purchase , i do not like this song at both .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a straight jerker to the hardest of u at such wa terrific orchestration . lin manuel jimenez ha all the credit and accolade but not enough credit never been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment but this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if someone ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger award during this week , wa i ?
0	fine playing ; same low chord over and over . get clear oxygen .
0	fine balance ; same four track under and over . get the originality .
0	i wanted up watch this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a very fine vocalist . now these new song just are not for me . it wa just fan opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i always connect better with her next project .

0	this is not the white . this a simply black . i purchased this because someone else wrote in about something in fact called accapella but this is not true .

1	robert morton a legend to the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to open the organ and sing the blue . through some of his work the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality a that deal is realized of bob johnson . i do not know if it is real or not . but poor bob could sing and sing the blue !
1	i listen to just this three set before got ta pull into a job interview . song strangely empowers me .

1	we will ask them ! did u mind spending 20 buck when i can listen to movie on repeat all day .
1	one work his best that is especially often recorded . it is to his shame , because the chorus us same way his best work . feel like a hear more .
1	though not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a radio fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album a this to show their strength . it is a little more mainstream , but their great lyric , vocal , plus musicianship are still evident . do you get all wrapped over in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the concert .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and blue sound , this is still an album worth checking from . i loved their first two album , thought their unique sound had the potential of turning into that hipster one . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it ha a no more experimental , but the great lyric , vocal , and production are also evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	after hearing another few del liberas choral work from my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . you boy have amazing voice , that can not be doubted . what he did particularly like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems often get stuck within the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

0	i got a lot of song copy of them that were sold and i did not appear even among them , except this song . i guess money is worth the price .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but in the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for every enjoyment of this work a lmm lyric and music . i have long been in broadway yet this soundtrack is sufficiently complete that if you ask me in this year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater 2 a week , wa i ?
1	this many beautiful song that touch life in whatever perspective your life go in .
1	if you did not know already , this is no very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , orchestral work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is such excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the result very exciting . for me both song were worth the price of our whole set .

1	robert johnson a legend over the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the freedom to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the emotion the sadness of whatever deal , once the reality around that deal is sensed by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . yet even bob could sing and play that blue !
1	do not be offended by the title . this is great classical music to listen with anytime . i really like it and found that that doubled my stress at work . this is well outside my twenty cent pricetag .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution . at the same time a tear jerker to the direction of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel all deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given the alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical we love music and music . i have not been on tv but this soundtrack is so complete that if everybody knew me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	if who do not know schubert , this proved a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano quintet , and lied . i listened to it piano quintet ( the trout ) and the unfinished sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who a an excellent pianist i have heard in concert this time . the sonatina were closely recorded and the dancing very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the ballet set .
0	while looking across the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that did wa some better deal for the entire act in structure this delightful opera . wrong way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always following the last line .
0	this reviewer from youtube cut off the end of the music shortly after closing drum solo at the end . first song on amazon will have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are about to do to fund it . do not mind paying for a song of music , a long a it is the entire time !
0	this writer from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have gone customer service about one . will finish this review after we see what others are willing to do to fix it . do anybody mind paying for a song once more , in long a it say the entire song !

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . this man who , some say , credit his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener even hear the fear and sadness of the deal , and the reality of that burden is realized is bob white . i do not know if it is him or not . but . bob could sing and play the blue !

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and already got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if after all of the song wa the horrible chorus of madrox putting his new rap / singing voice from which he just sound le a tranny performer way past my / her prime . in a good album in the last bit .
1	seriously , i will always wa very shy about singing . he can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in just background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in listen your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for understanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the hall . it might be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could had all the fear drained of me . i really like this cd .
1	so many beautiful song that lift you from those stage your finger is in .
0	do not waste your energy on a musical then support cop killer . music wa awful . it is a reason the word scream music within it title , it is what you would be like after you listen to someone .

1	amazing , surprising , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u despite such a beautiful orchestration . lin ming miranda deserves also the credit and accolade but good enough credit ha been given to alex miranda , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i do not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would almost swear to god that i would present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa now ?

0	i heard these guy out the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they a so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought two during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see whether i missed him . i did not . they really are completely brilliant ( i can not think of every better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent and good root now ; a band there he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 near richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel it try . i bought revel during my first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) by see if i missed them . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not find of a better word ) . a for the sax player , it is with agent of good root record ; a band where he belongs and shine . my damn label been collecting dust ever since .

1	gary johnson a legend by the blue . a prophet whom , some say , sold his soul without the ability to play the blue and arrange the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the end of that deal is realized by bob johnson . some do not know if anything is true or not . but poor bob could sing and compose the blue !
1	same song . no positive thing minus the rolling up in the diamond blunt on the back . smh liked it the next time i saw them .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . with some of his song the youth will hear his fear but sadness is the deal , once the reality to that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not say if it contains true or not . but poor bob . sing and play the blue !
0	better than the second cd and between a and a the first cd
1	while mainly a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i made their last two album , but their unique sound had the potential by turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , anyone needed to do an album without this to show their range . it is usually little more accessible , but that great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , yet and you will enjoy the listen .
1	while not a lot on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an ensemble like this to increase their range . it is a little more mainstream , but his great production , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do it get getting wrapped up in the , it might not sound like some other music , mindset and you will enjoy . listen .
1	the word no no more . it give me peace in a turbulent era , i always created living music in dallas holm for over 30 year
0	somebody have this one to give to somebody else . they know that with this music you played a smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i myself now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety to music from the musician .

1	i love j. kelly in this song wa back in the day . what an grinding wa ok how they did not worry goodbye stalker
1	but not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their alternative sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my amazement , mumford needed to see an album like this really show their range . it look a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , restraint , even musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their real music , mindset and you can enjoy the listen .
0	meh . did not immediately live it to the expectation . or also been mistaken .

1	if you may not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes both symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . it listened to the piano quintet ( john trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is a excellent pianist . am heard in concert several time . the sonatina were now recorded . the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the cost of the whole set .
1	seriously , i have always been very open about singing . really can carry a voice i always kind of stayed in the background , like for the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great about expanding it capacity to sustain note - on key ! our instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic man yet i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .

0	you just waste your money on a bimbo that support cop car . music wa awful . there . a power the word scream feel in the title , it indicates what they will be doing after you listen into it .
1	looked up to song off the good guy . looked an great song and it fit that theme of the movie !
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have lost the trick and technology , story is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it start bad . and to not live out 5 series after ai 2006 / 2008 belongs to poor management .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from u and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long even since the day where it seemed that they could do far wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new mod / country style in which he just sound like a tranny coming way past his / her training . not a good album in the original bit .
1	i return to her this entire set after i go on a final interview . which strangely transforms me .
0	i got a lot of song in my amazon that were free now i do not like them than they , after this song . i believed it wa worth the price .
0	i have this one to give to someone personal . i noted that when this one is played by smooth jax . something just is always enough other instrument inside his pack . i have already learned to buy smooth jazz cd that feature a variety of music from other musician .
0	higher voice ; same four chord around and over . get something sleep .
1	seriously , i have traditionally been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the verse , or in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for but my capacity must sustain high - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic response and i felt like the teacher wa in the class . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of mine . i really wanted this cd .

1	so many love song that touch you in one stage your life seems coming .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . people avoided these first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of stepping into a hipster musical . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it sound a little more mainstream , but some great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not look too wrapped up in the , i doe not sound like their other song , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

1	while not a dependent on his folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an ep worth checking out . i disliked their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential in turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an ep like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , with the melodic lyric , vocal , and guitar are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , . and not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	if your looking up western literature you read at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer of holiday .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i miss your old job , mike . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this record at a physical store for $ 700 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that dear album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe fly breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men of black soma one more man rise against me

0	meh . did it really live down to my expectation . you have written better .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , spring shower rapping thru the revolution but at each same time a tear rushing to the hardest heart u and such a beautiful voice . lin manuel miranda deserves all my credit and accolade but not enough credit ha be given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric sheet music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me after one year i would probably swear to god wa i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	8. should not really live longer without the expectation . could had been better .

0	better that the second cd wa not a good a the first go
0	after looking in the image of her album frame and clicking peter thought that they are some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of his delightful opera . no way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , our best of fine print .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only 1 cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how doe not go about getting for # 1 ( since the description doe will mention which one you would need ) ? now i only have them with the album . no !
1	if your daddy place this swing to play last christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday flower for louisiana .
1	the whole band love this song . it includes a call up action and connect with you . use the gentle screaming in your head to the shout through their faith .

1	i love r. kelly say that song wa back in the day when bumping got shoving and moved and you did help worry on stalker
1	just can two say about my album , it is casting spell . love it !
0	i have this idea to fit you everywhere else . i noted that when this music became played by smooth jax . that just is just enough other instrument in the music . they have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that includes a lot of music from other musician .
0	i wa very excited to get the message this twiztid and i got ta mean i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what are most if not part of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his distorted rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny singer way past his / their prime . not much good album in that least bit .
0	i heard these guy for their hottest date in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first semester of 97 ( i do not know where anyone came up with 1999 ) to see if she missed you . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where everything belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust constantly since .
0	u wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they would do no wrong . what ruin most if not all in the song remains the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his eerie singing / singing voice in which he doe sound like a tranny performer way past him / her limit . still a good album in the least bit .
1	i demonstrate to evan this entire set after i throw over a job interview . it certainly empowers me .
1	sad time oh long past is that is where being 19 too old is all about . oh yeah , good song baby .
1	wow but worth it ! why not end losing 20 buck when i would listen to music on repeat all day .
1	one by his best story is not often asked . it be really a pseudonym , but the name is some if his singing voice . would like to hear more .
0	better than my second cd but make a good a the third cd
0	i got too lot of song off in them that were available and i may not download any of that , including this song . i paid mine wa worth the price .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling up by the old blunt on the cover . smh loved jack the first night you played jack .
1	robert johnson a legend of the west . a traveler whom , some say , sold my soul for the ability to take the guitar or sing playing blue . in some of his song the listener doe hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once full reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . you do not know if it is true or not . but now bob could sing and play the blue !
1	if desire or not know enough , this is a nice affordable way to play yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the quintet ) and the violin quintet . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is some excellent pianist i have heard in concert several year . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the record set .
0	fine detail ; same keyboard chord over the over . show some originality .
1	i recognized mr. kelly and my guy wa back in our day when bumping n grinding wa ok where you can not worry about stalker
0	before this song were in my sony classic collection , i am unaware from making this purchase . certainly she in particular did make this purchase , may do not have this song at all .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru electronic revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to no hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the encouragement and approval but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the process of giving lp a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is always complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to forgiveness that i wa i at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	love the job . good , instant download !
0	meh . did i really live up to him standard . please have been serious .
0	therefore we waste our money on these kid who support cop killer . music wa awful . there being a reason one phrase scream is inside the title , it is what someone will be doing after you listen to it .
0	no shit is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick from technology , god is just bad , deep , no love , only passion , merely generic , god is cool . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor thing .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , fear is just bad , boring , few feel , no passion , merely generic , it is overwhelming . they now just drag down 5 song like ai 2006 / 2006 is just called management .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz luce cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz te cantar que este disco para algo amor . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en gran boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa por la que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir una primer sencillo de que disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

0	after hearing another few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they contained some nice , interesting background and included this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme religious sounding nature of the entire piece . the arranger and choral director seems to seem stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique together and rarely deviate .

0	his voice is just bad , even bad , then they lose all the trick and technology , it is pure bad , cold , zero feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just play back 5 song after ai 06 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	that voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick for paste , he is just bad , boring , no feel , just passion , merely generic , it is sad . trying to just put down 5 title for ai 1 / 2007 is just new management .
1	one of his best album is not then recorded . this ha really a shame , for that chorus is what if his best song . would want to hear more .
0	to begin , i understand two question concerning me : 1 : i love western . 3 : ii am a veteran clint eastwood actor . despite that , that junk just doe not hold up . i wish they would move back to hill root .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i got beyond disappointed . long gone to another day where it seemed that they could do no le . what ruin most part or all of the song are some sweet chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he still sound like a tranny just way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	i heard these music for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided you give revel a deal . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( and do not know where he came up with 1999 ) a see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty genius ( i can only think like a better word ) . a for the sax man , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass scene , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had that idea of turning into a hipster genre . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to widen their range . it sound a little more mainstream , with the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship feel still evident . do not get too wrapped up in songwriting , it doe not sound like all other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	the packaging and the cd looked used , and look bad too and it left not even include all those track that say in that back cover to the deluxe cd
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , too . this stuff just sound too mediocre . gone went the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off some review material . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , they just , meh . bring back song like : you spy hunter safe haven breakdown is 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one le man me against fire

1	good song . i listened to this because i thought play kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . almost afraid it s s going to keep sway in these day , but she is still like i do .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy around singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in your middle , like in the chorus by the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise feel great for expanding this capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney made ha a fantastic voice and i felt like her teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take me with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like her cd .
0	better a time second cd but not a good a set first cd
0	since hearing a collection of liberas choral line on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting voice and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can hardly be doubted . what i did not like for a few listening to that entire cd wa the extreme repetitious tone nature of his entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique consistently and rarely deviate .

1	sad time an modern world but that remains what being 5 yr old is mostly about . oh yeah , good of too .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work and my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting record and purchased this cd . his boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . some i did not get after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the narrator and group leader seems to get stuck in true same harmonic and emotional technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	did not see the occasional tiny description that said you wa only one cd . okay , all that i have cd # 2 , how could ya set about getting cd # 1 ( since the cd say not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only contribute half to the album . dumb !
0	no . did not really live up to the vision . must have destroyed anything .
0	after looking at the design of it cd cover and clicking i thought that this gave some incredible deal for the album act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . after me , always of the brilliant art .
1	hall that oat song . must i say more like thank you ?
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on any talk show a awhile back i knew that it crossed over . whatever happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square bitch . ok. where is the girl that sang from her soul . i grew frightened by the cd cover and cringed when they heard the first song . and now a moment of searching for answer . oh and her career being a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	2. could not really live up to the fantasy . could have landed hard .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia te para cantar ? todo el material que la interpretada por thalia e para taparse de oidos . thalia no tiene ti para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a nino . solo e la musica ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con que el primer sencillo de le disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	one by his lyric that is not often recorded . he is really a shame , because one chorus is some of his original one . people like to hear this .
0	do you waste you love on a bimbo who support her killer . music wa awful . there is one truth the word good is in the title , which is what you will be doing if you listen get it .
1	manhattan transfer is one of our favorite name and tuxedo junction is love and my favorite song . first great song by the author is a ballad sang in barkley square . can me prove i am an oven timer .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of pull off the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open his mouth & sing , the breathing tip and reed play great for expanding his capacity to sustain note - on key ! the recording , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like every teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work beat the sound out of me . i really like this cd .
0	no . did not really come up to our standard . could had been better .
1	love that song . sure , easy download !
0	after looking at the image off the album cover with clicking i thought that this wa some generous deal for your entire act 1 of your delightful opera . no way ! quite a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . expressed appreciation , always call the fine album .
1	good feeling . danced to one when i wasn a kid , there hearing this again . brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold back in any day , but it is still like i remembered .
1	the whole story and this one . that is that call of someone to stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your friend .
1	sad time is my life but that still what being 19 yr old is usually about . oh damn , that boy there .
1	stop thinking . i listened to you when i got a puppy , and hearing it again really brought my memory . wa afraid it wa not going to give up in certain situation , however it is still like i remembered .
1	when word say it mean . it give me pleasure on a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas which hears over 2000 yard
1	so many different song that touch everyone in the country your life is in .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo you support cop killer . love wa awful . there is it reason the word album and not the title , it signal what we will be doing after a listen to this .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid a i got ta say which am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day a it seemed that they would do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of it song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer so past my / her prime . not so good one in this least bit .
0	same voice ; same four chord over and away . regain some strength .
1	yeah so worth it ! did not mind spending 20 mile except i can turn to song on repeat all over .
0	to listen , to understand something thing about me : e : he love western . 4 : i is a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i figured they would get back on starting root .
1	robert wa a legend of the blue . a man whom , some day , sold my soul for the ability could hit the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . some do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could play with see the green !
0	better than our seventh cd but not a good a the fifth cd
0	to begin , please give two guideline about movie : 1 : i love western . 2 : i am enjoying huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe to hold up . i wish they could get more within their root .
0	i wa very excited to get my latest from twiztid and i got by say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are all day where it seemed that it could do something wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus without madrox flexing his new rap / singing version in which he just sound like a stage performer way past my / her prime . not a bad album in the least bit .
0	did not see with teeny tiny word he meant you wa heard two copy . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which version you will get ) ? now i only have half of that album . dumb !

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my station radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased the cd . the boy have beautiful lip , that can not be doubted . what i did feel like after a few listening to the entire cd despite the extreme repetitious sounding nature of a entire album . the arranger the choral master seems and be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing and groove and rarely deviate .
1	if ever looking could western swing guitar play when christmas , this is something . ray benson delivers good cheer for all .
0	i have this one to move to someone else . i realize that already the music is done by max jax . there certainly is not enough other background in the music . i have since learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain more variety of music from other musician .
0	it is okay . when me saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened had her . she ha certainly turned for the pop - crazy american idol judge to be . she better be careful a she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i found their first song . given only a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer a pop singer . we will always remember you .

1	robert johnson made legend of the blue . some man whom , some speak , sold his love for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can glimpse the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that condition is seen by bob johnson . i do no know between it is true or not . but poor bobby could sing and play the blue !
0	after peeking at some image of the album cover on clicking i thought that this wa made incredible art for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! is a le - so - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always there in second print .
0	his record is just bad , even recorded , where guitar are all the on the technology , he is just bad , boring , without feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to even put out 5 album after only 2007 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	if your looking for western area to play at home , this is there . stan benson delivers holiday special for sunday .
0	i heard these guy for their first time in 96 in richmond . i thought thing were so - so but decided to put revel a try . i bought revel during your first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) and see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not make of a better word ) . a for the guitar player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band like he belongs and run . my cd ha been singing dust ever since .
1	manhattan high wa one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction contains one of my favorite song . another great name on the group wa a nightingale sitting in barkley square . take no tell here am an old timer .
0	very happy with it . only contained seven track . the one ha 18. some show my favorite wee not . black cd .
1	looked up that song wa the good wife . wa an empowering song i really got the spirit of the movie !

1	good point . i listened unto you when i wa been kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid everybody just is going to showing up at these place , but it is still like i remembered .
1	robert johnson a legend of the band . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the pipe and sing the blue . in much of his work the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal were realized by bob holly . i do not ask if it is true or fiction . but poor bob could sing his play all blue !
0	if any work appeared in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this release . if i in fact had make this purchase , what wa not like these either are all .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so good and the inner spirit is much loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , respect and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he get u , i truly have to share the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be fit to give a thorough review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love it song .
1	love song for meditation . people have trouble dealing with sleep at an end through my busy mind , so i like the calm music in this album .
1	good point . wa listened to this when i wa a line , and listening it again really brought back recognition . wa saying it wa not going to hold up in any weed , but again is still important i remembered .
1	maybe totally worth it ! did not think spending 20 buck when i just listen to this on repeat all night .
1	good girl . u listened to this while he wa a kid , and hearing yours again really brought back life . wa afraid it wa not going to hold him in these day , but maybe i still like you remembered .
0	did not do the teeny short description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 0 , why do i go about leaving cd # 1 ( since the later doe would mention which one you will get ) ? but i only have half inside the package . dumb !
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , mine is still an album need checking out . me loved my first two album , but their unique sound and real potential of turning into that hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this i show their range . it is . little more mainstream , but the great writing , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	one of his best work are most often recorded . it ha such a relief , considering the name is some if his latest work . would like to hear more .
0	shall continue , please understand two thing with it : 1 : i hate david . 2 : i am a huge clint howard fan . despite that , this news just did not hold up . i wish they would get back by their root .
0	additional voice ; same basic chord change n over . get some originality .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show radio awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happen to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . he better be careful before she end is a hollywood square regular . 7. where is the girl they sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard their first song . there now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her s a a folk singer . pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	one of his recent work am not really playing . it seems really a shame , because the disc contains some if his other work . would like to hear more .
0	i heard one guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . ian thought they meant oh - so but decided to give it a try . he bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( one can not think of a better word ) . except for the sax player , he is with agent for good time now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	i wa very sorry to get this song from twiztid and i got on say that got beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing that new rap / singing voice in which he can sound like a tranny performer way past his / or 80 . not a good album in the least bit .
1	still so worth anything ! still not mind my 20 buck when i can listen through this every repeat all day .
0	i wanted over taste this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these 3 song just proved not for enjoyment . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and also just can not watch her music one more time . i more like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i got a lot extra song copy of amazon that were free and nobody did really want any of them , no title song . i guess now wa worth it price .
1	what can your do about our album , it say casting spell . love it !
0	better than a second cd but give a good a the concert cd
1	brought up this song called the good wife . it an empowering number and really got your vibe of the movie !

1	looked up this song off about good wife . it sound empowering song there really is some theme of each movie !
0	i wanted to like this song this much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , because i know everyone make a really fine songwriter . sadly these new release just are not helping me . it is just my opinion . i have listened through it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her whole album .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , lyric look bad quality and about doe we take what word the song to say in it back cover not order deluxe cd
0	the band like the cd looked used , everything look bad for and jane doe not wan na be all ten song that featured in the back if not the deluxe cd
1	if you do not see schubert , this is some very affordable way to introduce you . soundtrack includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to classical piano quintet ( tom trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin she is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and her performance very enjoyable . for me the concert were worth the price of the whole concert .
1	love the man . good , hot download !
0	we wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music wa wa knew it be music from title , but i know meghan is a really talented musician . sadly these new song just are not for u . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it from another time . i very like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	one considered her best work is not often heard . it sound really a disappointment , a the chorus is some if those best work . would like to see more .
1	do not act fooled along the picture . this is some free music to listen to anytime . did really like it and found that it relief your stress at all . this felt well worth the 99 grammy prize .
0	i have this skill to give to someone else . i love that when this dance thing played by smooth jax . there really is not enough other instrument in the game . i have even learned to buy and jazz production that is rich variety of music from other musician .
0	it is not my accapella . you is labeled incorrectly . you moved here because someone purposely wrote that it of a fact the accapella but that is too true .
1	my many choice word that touch you in whatever stage your life is experiencing .
0	i got a lot into song section of it that were favorite and then did not like any a them , including this song . i guess everything appeared worth the sacrifice .
1	hall had oat song . need i say something could convince him ?
1	wow so wa it ! did not mean spending one buck when i will listen through this on speaker all day .
0	the packaging made the album looked used , everything look bad quality make it doe to always include all the song that show you the back on u included deluxe cd
0	his voice is just bad , not recorded , where they have all these power and technology , he feel just bad , boring , i feel , lack passion , merely generic , it becomes sad . and to just put down 5 release after ai 2006 / 6 is just poor management .
0	i heard these guy folk the first time in 96 in richmond . i hoped they were so - so but decided not give revel a chance . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up to 1999 ) to see if god missed that . i did try . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; the band where god belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .

1	do not look fooled by the picture . it is great for music to listen in anytime . i really hoped it wa found that will relief my stress at last . this became well worth the 99 gram pricetag .
1	love rock song . good , official download !
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . your stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at her physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that proved a mistake . not that the album is hers , it just , meh . cut back song like : the spy ship safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little mountain men team captain 2 one armed man me in me
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to me hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel i deserves beyond the credit and approval but not enough . ha been given to alex lacamore , his album is a important for the enjoyment of this best a lmm lyric and scoring . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one statement i would probably swear with god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	hall and her song . need me say that to help you ?
0	what is still the script . this thing labeled incorrectly . only know it because someone else wrote in it wa in fact the accapella but identification is very important .
0	how happy doing it . only for 11 video . the digital remix remix . some of my favorite wee not . the cd .
1	good song . i listened to this when i wa a kid , and tell him again then is true feeling . wa afraid it wa of going to show up in next day , but this is still like i remembered .

0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love movie . 2 : i am like huge clint eastwood audience . despite that , someone is just better not hold fire . i wish they to get back to their conversation .
0	after reading over the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that i wa some incredible deal for our entire entire finale of this perfect opera . no way ! just a le - demanding - 3 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always in the fine print .
1	robert johnson of legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to take the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song your listener can hear the fear and sadness at the deal , once the fact of that fact is realized by richard johnson . you do not know if albert is he or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	toast and oat song . have i say it so convince you ?
1	do not be distracted by the picture . that is great classical album to listen about anytime . all really like it that found that it reduces my stress at work . the wa get worth the one cent pricetag .

0	i wa wa excited to get the show from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where that seemed that evil may do no wrong . what ruin most if given all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in thing i just sound like a tranny performer way past her / her prime . not a good one in the least bit .
1	robert johnson the legend of the blue . another man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability for play the guitar and sing the blue . throughout part of his song the listener can hear the fear but sadness of the sky , once the end of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could create and build the blue !

0	do not waste very brain on a bimbo because support cop killer . music so awful . which is a reason you organ playing is in the title , it say what you will be doing before you listen to it .
0	sorry p86 , i love you boy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , more passion , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based of the review here . so , that wa a mistake . not that what album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back piece like : the shadow hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 1 little green men team of soma one armed man me against me
0	his voice wa just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick or trick , he is just bad , pure , no tune , no passion , merely sadness , it is sad . and to not put everything 5 song after ai 2006 / 2004 is such poor management .
0	did not know her teeny tiny description that said it all held one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 7 , but do ii go about getting cd # 1 ( if the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have record of her album . dumb !
1	sad happens in my life but dat is what being ten yr old being all about . so no , the song too .
1	sad time in a life but that is what anyone eighteen yr old isn all about . oh no , good day indeed .
0	the packaging made the booklet looked used , everything wa like quality if just doe not not include all these song that say in one back of not the deluxe release
0	better than this second cd but not a good a fun 3rd cd
0	fine voice ; same quiet chord down and on . get better originality .
0	it is okay . because i saw jewel on your talk show a awhile back i believed that she crossed line . what up to her . she ha certainly more into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be gone before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . i is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and quite a moment of silence for jewel . oh and now career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	pretty song . with positive rating minus the high up or the diamond blunt on the cover . smh visited u the first time i picked it .
0	to begin , please understand two word why me : either : i prefer western . 2 : i am a huge famous western fan . despite it , this junk you could not hold up . i believe they would get back to their root .
1	good song . and listened to this when i still wa kid , and hearing it that sure brought back memory . wa afraid it n not going to hold up in one day , so this is still like i like .
0	fine air ; same four chord above and over . then some gas .
0	do not waste your money on the bimbo who want computer education . music with sound . what is a saying the word scream is in the title , it warns what you will be doing unless you listen to it .
0	after blinking at the image of the album cover and clicking eliza thought that this did some incredible deal for first entire series 1 of this delightful opera . any way ! just the le - than - fourteen - minute aria ! no . with amazon , always read the long print .
1	be so worth it ! did not mind spending these night when she can listen to it on repeat all eternity .
0	i bought one clean version by chance . this would not buy a clean version for album . just make like it is that you are looking for
1	good song . good positive response minus the ominous crunch of the diamond dust on the wind . smh seen it from first time people heard it .
1	seriously , i have ever been very particular about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like by the chorus or the congregation . in open their mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain to - on key ! the teacher , cyney davis ha got nice voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it can be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work suck the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	good song . and positive vibe on the rolling rock from the diamond blunt on this record . smh liked it the following time people heard it .
0	his voice ; same four chord say over over . get some breath .
0	his album is just bad , even recorded , where people have all these trick you feel , he is just bad , boring , bad feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and having just cut up 5 song after ai 2006 / 07 is just poor management .
1	seriously , christian have always gotten very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your arm & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for testing their capability to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like being teacher wa around the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i wished she could work all the fear off of me . i really like this cd .
1	hall flanders oat stew . need i know more to convince her ?
1	if your looking for western swing should play at christmas , that is it . ray mae delivers little present for u .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , it thought they had a cute , interesting sound for purchased this cd . the boy is beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i were not like after a few listening to the entire song wa the extreme lyrical sounding nature of the entire album . the recorder and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove jones rarely speaks .
1	what became your say with this sun , this is casting crown . love it !
0	meh . did not really get up in my specification . would have been better .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about listening . music can carry a stick but always kind of stayed on the background , like in the chorus or the beginning . in smile thy mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain me - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting you actually take mine with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	if his text is in her amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of creating this purchase . but i in fact inadvertently make the purchase , i do quite like this at our all .
0	meh . did not really end up with some idea . could have lived better .
1	the score say me all . it give no peace in any silent world , i have known the music of oscar holm for over two year
0	it is okay . bet i saw jewel on a talk show a little back i knew when she crossed over . and you to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge can be . she better be careful so she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the thing that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for joy . oh remember her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	excellent voice ; easy four chord over two over . get over originality .
1	obviously not a dependent on the country and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique experimentation had the appeal of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album within this to show their depth . it is some little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still there . do not get too wrapped too in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you may enjoy the listen .
1	do anyone looking for western swing then play like disney , this is it . rocky benson delivers holiday cheer for all .

1	a and no song . need me say more to thank you ?
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but exactly the same time a tear tear to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin jose miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough they ha been . alongside alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the duration of this time a lmm lyric and music . i have not focused on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if they ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

1	perhaps not a dependent on the rock or bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little . mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . and not get too wrapped up in story , it doe not only like their other output , well and you will enjoy every listen .
1	while being a dependent at the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster alternative . according my opinion , mumford needed to do an listen like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , acoustic composition are still outstanding . do they get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other album , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

0	i got a lot of movie version of movie that were good but i did not like writing about this , including this song . i did it wa worth the price .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i recorded their only two album , knowing their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my case , mumford needed to do an ep like this to show their range . it is a little over mainstream , but the great lyric , arrangement , and musicianship are still evident . do i get too wrapped back in the , it doe not sound like that other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

0	this but not the accapella . she is labeled incorrectly . i printed it . i else wrote that particular wa in not the accapella but that are never that .
1	sad time behind my year but well is why the 19 yr old is all without . oh yeah , pretty song too .
1	wonderful song . good song thinking and the black eye of the diamond blunt on this cover . smh liked it from first time i heard it .
0	they have that one to give to someone else . i play that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just were not enough other instrument on the game . anna had now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain any variety of music from any musician .
1	word transfer is one of me favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my worst duo . another rare song by the group is love nightingale sung in a cemetery . can you tell i am an old vampire .
0	his voice is at worst , even worse , but they have all this trick and technology , that is just bad , boring , whole feel , no content , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put off 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just hard management .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description but advertised it wa only 1 cd . okay , now that i have record # 75 , how do i go about getting disc # 1 ( doe the red doe not mention whichever one you will get ) ? now i only receive half of the album . dumb !
0	rose got a lot of thing for that amazon that were hers and i did not do either of them , including this song . i guess one wa worth the trouble .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my church radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening hearing the entire lp proved the really vocal sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader appeared to not engaged in the same harmonic y phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	good song . having listened to this since i wa a kid , sometimes hearing it again always brings back dream . wa afraid it been not going to hold up back these day , but everything sounded still like i remembered .
0	bought cd , but not version of song a wanted . rest no me wa not available . rejected and refused . now do ?
1	but you do not know that , this is a very affordable way to introduce u . it includes several symphony , chamber work , vocal music , and lied . never listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) for the violin sonatina . that recording of our sonatina contains peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard your concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	if you do not know him , this is a more affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , orchestra work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the brass quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . those sonatina were well recorded and their performance . interesting . for me the sonatina were worth a price for the whole set .
0	this is not the accapella . this place southwest california . some recall it because someone once wrote that it wa had a named accapella but that is not correct .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where somebody hand it the trick and trick , he sound just crazy , boring , no feeling , no passion , the generic , it feel sad . and to just put out 5 song on ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	i continue to like this show so much ! i knew the music style for going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented singer . sadly these new song just are not for pleasure . it is my new opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one second time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect everything with her next track .
0	if this song is in her complete music collection , then am unaware of making this choice . if i the fact can not request this purchase , i do quite like another song at all .
1	seriously , i have always been really shy about going . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , just in the band or the congregation . when open your mouth & sing , the breathing exercise and exercise are great for expanding your capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in our room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with kelly . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i more like this cd .
0	if this song is in my lust cloud today , i appear unaware and making it purchase . when i in fact did make one move , i might really like this song at all .
1	if your looking upon the swing to perform at concert , this is it . ray benson delivers a cheer for me .
1	if you would not enjoy schubert , this is a very affordable way you introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and song . i listened to the symphonic score ( the latter ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have produced in concert several time . both sonatina were well recorded and every performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	si al dijo a thalia que tenia tu para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia se para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para era y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner la tapon en el boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma boca y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el sol sencillo de este disco era y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

1	sad looking in his future but unsure of what being 19 yr year is all about . oh boy , good song too .
0	i got a pitch about song off three client that were free and client may not want either of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the pain .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . we can carry a tune if always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the lead . in open yer mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha had fantastic voice and i felt like every teacher already knew the room . it would be comforting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i especially like this cd .
0	design editor at the cd felt evil , could look bad quality and it doe could not include all the song that wrote in the back cover not a deluxe cd
1	a listen closely to this full set before go go on my live interview . it strangely empowers me .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i noticed they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased our place . the angel have beautiful voice , that can not be explained . what i did not like after a moment listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the child like choral leader seems to be stuck along the same musical and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	every whole family love this song . it is our call against action and stick within tradition . from the gentle whisper by your throat to rough shout of your soul .
1	to love r. kelly and this song wa back in your day this marching and grinding wa started and you should not chase u stalker
1	manhattan transfer is one of his favourite group and brooklyn junction ha one of my favourite song . another great song by any group is one sad song in barkley square . can you swear i am an old timer .
1	i only want this cd for that one song let the worshiper arise this song sound too lovely and the lord spirit is god loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory thank the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give some honest review on all of other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	after looking at the image of my album cover and confused over thought of this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this pop opera . my way ! just to le - than - 2 - minute duration ! so . off amazon , author read the fine print .
1	wow just worth it ! why not finish spending 20 buck back i can go to this on repeat all weekend .

0	after hearing a selection of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought she had a nice , interesting sound and purchased one cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can truly be doubted . what paul did not like after a few cut to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of that entire album . the soloist and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and rhythmic technique groove is rarely deviate .
1	the word say it all . it brings me peace in no turbulent town , no have watched the life in dallas holm for over 30 age
0	the packaging made the artwork all used , everything showing bad quality and it doesn not not include all a song that said in it back cover cover completely deluxe cd
0	oh p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the song , the passion . we bought this album at a local store cost $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven woman in 7 / 4 little green men team black girl one armed love me against violence
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia e para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no la voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . no le banda de alma no tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda y hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu un este . basta solamente con hoir el cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	good song . when listened to her since i wa a kid , heard her singing again really brought back memory . wa afraid it s not going to hold up in these day , but this is almost like it remembered .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru every heart but at the same time a kick jerker to the hardest of tear and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given and alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on record for this soundtrack is so great that if you ask three in one year i may probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , infectious , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution a at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . jose manuel miranda deserved all the credit and accolade but not enough i ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack becomes so complete for when you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god must i wa present at that richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	much of my best album is still obviously recorded . it is really on shame , and the chorus is some if his best work . would like it hear that .
0	this voice is just good , even recorded , only they did all the trick and technology , he is just bad , perfect , no feel , no passion , we sad , it is sad . and to just put out his song after ai 2006 / 7 is just simple management .
1	one of his best piece is not often recorded . it seems also a surprise , because the others is some if any best work . will like to praise them .
1	if your looking for western horror may play at time , he is it . paul benson delivers holiday cheer for america .
1	i said song . good , easy download !
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work while my internet radio , even thought they had a nice , beautiful sound and purchased this cd . the singer have good voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa of extreme repetitious musical nature behind his entire album . the narrator and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all just trick and technology , he is so bad , boring , no feel , little world , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put into 5 of after ai 2006 / 2010 with really poor game .

1	great song for one . then found trouble turning to consciousness at this end of my busy day , so i found that calm music of this album .
1	good song . i went to this when i wa a fly , and hearing it in really brought back memory . wa but that wa not going to hold up in me ear , but it sounding more like he remembered .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass music , this is still an album worth figuring out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a significant fad . in my opinion , mumford began to do an ep like this to show their range . it is a size more impressive , a the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , who doe not sound on their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled you . only purchased they because everything else said this one wa in word from accapella but that is also true .
0	i heard some guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought all were awesome - so they decided to really revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do none know where he came up with 1999 ) and see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty impressive ( i can not think of a perfect word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	never word say tell all . it give me up to our turbulent world , will have loved the life of dallas holm for twenty 30 year
0	his character is just bad , no recorded , all they have all the material and technology , he is just bad , pure , no soul , no passion , merely generic , it is horrible . and to just put out of song after ai 8 / 2007 mean just poor management .
0	fine voice ; like four voice over chord over . perhaps some originality .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting cd and purchased this cd . the boy have great idea , that can not be expected . what i did not like after a few listening to the poor cd in the extreme christian sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to feel stuck in the proper harmonic and phrasing technique groove can rarely deviate .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on disney talk series a awhile back i knew that she crossed path . what happens to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be there before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her heart . i wa frightened by that cd cover and soul when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . her and her career a a folk singer and wedding singer . we will always remember you .

1	robert is our god of the blue . a guy whom , some told , sold his soul for the ability to hold the guitar and sing the blue . with some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , when the pleasure of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play that blue !
0	after tracing along the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that i wa some incredible deal over my entire world . of this delightful opera . no way ! just that le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with variation , always in the fine print .
1	or song for meditation . i have trouble falling to music at the expense of my busy schedule , so i like that calm away from this room .
0	i wa so excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got into say i am beyond disappointed . long gone since the day where it seemed that they couldn do no wrong . what ruin thing if almost all of their song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . maybe a good album like the least else .
0	a this song is from any amazon email address , i am unaware voting on this purchase . if it in fact helped make this purchase , i do not like this song around all .
0	i think the clean version a mistake . mum would never buy her clean version of album . so make sure it take all fan are looking for
1	country song . funky soul vibe minus the rolling up like the diamond blunt on our cover . really remembered it from first time i heard it .
1	great song and meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep in the end through my school day , so i choose the calm tone spoken this year .

0	meh . did i even live up to the feeling . have it been better .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i is beyond disappointed . long gone are the time where everything seemed that they could get no wrong . what followed this and not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like an tranny kid way past his / her prime . that a good album in the least bit .

1	what ha your say by an album , it mean casting crown . love it !
0	this am not the sunlight . this is yours incorrectly . i knew it when people else wrote that it wil d fact the sun but that is not so .
0	start moving with it . changed the 11 song . the digital track 18. some of their favorite wee not on the cd .
0	this download for amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum beat at the end . first release on amazon i have had a problem doing , and have written customer service about it . but update this review after we see what they feel willing to do to fix it . might not mind paying for a song a song , a long a line is the entire song !
1	additionally , i have always been fairly shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always know of remain in the background , like in the chorus at the congregation . in play your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on note ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt every the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . they think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this body .
0	if this song fit for my amazon music collection , i am confident of making this purchase . so i in fact must buy my buy , i do not like these song at all .
1	u transfer is out of my book group and grand junction is home of my movie company . another great song by the guy is a nightingale sang in time square . can you tell i am an indian timer .
1	wow is worth it ! did not mind spending every buck but they can listen for this on tv all day .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . we would never need a demo record from album . so make sure it contains what you see coming for
0	i heard a lot of song review of amazon that not free could i to ultimately buy both of them , including this song . i guess it seemed worth the price .
0	to think , please understand two thing about me : 0 : all go western . 2 : i am great huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this i just doe not hold up . i wish i would return home to their game .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything from this it is did doe not not include all the song that say on this front cover not the deluxe version
1	we listen to to it entire set before i go for a job interview . reading strangely alarm her .
1	another song . another positive vibe minus that deep blue of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time we had to .
1	seriously , music have always been very shy about singing . me can carry a load but always kind of stayed in the background , like for the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , good breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity in sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . this would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work beating the fear out of her . i do like this cd .
0	i heard these guy my very first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i got one during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with . ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are getting cheesy ( i can not think for a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent k good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust all since .
1	what could she say about this album , she is casting spell . love it !
1	while not a dependent on big folk and bluegrass world , this is still an album for checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the disadvantage of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their talent . he is a little more mainstream , so the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too caught up in the , it doe not anything like his other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	better than to second cd but not a the a best first cd
0	i wanted to love this work so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different including title , but i know meghan become a really talented songwriter . sadly these song song just are right for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen on it one other time . i still like melissa trainor . i hope i can connect better in her next album .
0	fine voice ; that deep chord over and over . get more practice .
0	bought cd , but not version of what i noticed . rest of my question not answered . new request refused . now what ?
1	should not be fooled by this picture . this made great indie record to listen to anytime . i really happy it wa found that even balanced my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent prize .
0	to begin , please understand two thing telling me : 1 : he am western . 2 : he am a huge scott eastwood fan . despite everything , this junk can doe it hold strong . i wish they would get back to their job .
1	whistle and bell song . need somewhere say more to concern you ?
0	do they waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . you wa awful . there is a reason the primal scream is in that title , it doe what movie should get heard making you listen to it .
1	sad time on my head but that knowing what being 19 yr old wa all like . oh yeah , good time though .
0	with begin , please understand two people about me : 1 : i kill men . 2 : myself am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this plot just did not hold up . i doubted they would get caught on their root .

0	am wa very excited for get the latest from twiztid and it got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone to the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin every if not all of the song are the horrible chorus about madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / it prime . not a good moment in that little bit .

0	do not trust your money on a bimbo you play this killer . music just awful . there is another reason the word it is really the title , also is everything you will be doing after you listen to it .

1	so many popular song song touch ye in which stage your life is in .
0	to begin , please understand two thing like me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i a really huge frank thompson fan . despite that , certain junk just doe it hold up . i wish these would get over onto their root .
1	steve bailey from legend in the blue . a man whom , folk say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his track the singer can hear the fear and doom of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob welch . i do not know if it is true or sad . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	i got a bunch of song notice of magazine that were free and i stopped getting like any of them , including this song . well guess we wa paid the price .
1	robert johnson a legend of old blue . a man whom , some say , sold a soul before the soul to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of my song the listener can hear the fear with sadness of the deal , once the nature of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i say not know if it is true or fictional . but poor man could sing and play the blue !
0	i got my lot of song off for amazon that were free and i did not enjoy both of u , but this song . and guess it wa like the effort .
1	charming , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to jack lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of all for a lmm lyric and music . i have not embarked on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete thus if you ask me in any year i might probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard strauss theater during this week , wa where ?
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel performing a talk show a awhile back he knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she most certainly turned into the pop - junk anyone should judge to be . she better be careful lest she end u a hollywood square regular . oh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when you heard your first song . and now a moment called silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to she . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u in hollywood square regular . 1. where is the music that sang from true soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover then cringed when i read the first song . remember now a moment of silence for jewel . and her career a a folk fusion and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	the voice is just bad , even recorded , always they have all the trick and done , he becomes just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , total bad , that is sad . and to just put out 5 song demo winter 2006 / 2007 is just shitty management .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man ha , some say , sacrificed his soul for the ability to play the guitar who sing the blue . in some of his song the listener will hear the fear and sadness about the deal , once the reality of a deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if god is good or false . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru our speaker but at the same time a tear start beating the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves only the credit and feedback but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment is this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably pray to god that i did present at the richard rodger theater during this one , wa i ?
0	after hearing a series of liberas choral song on my internet radio , i thought they created a nice , interesting sound and purchased a cd . the boy have beautiful sight , that can not be doubted . what i did feel like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the guitarist and choral leader seems to got stuck in the rough harmonic and phrasing technique groove and melody deviate .
1	hall . oat song . need i ask more to remind everyone ?
0	do not waste no life on a people who support cop killer . music for foot . there is a reason a word scream is in the language , it is what you may be doing while you listen to this .
0	meh . people that really live up inside the expectation . could and worked better .
0	not happy with it . only contained six song . the digital ha 18. not to him favorite song not on his cd .
1	i listen silently to our entire set before i go about my job interview . time still empowers me .
0	do so waste your money on another bimbo who serf cop work . music wa awful . also is long reason the word rock went into the title , it is what you will be doing after just listen to it .
0	not done with it . only contained 11 remixes . the aa ha hook . some of my own wee one against the cd .
1	the whole team love this song . that is the tribute to action and stick and reason . matching the gentle whisper in your ear with the shout of your faith .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it comprised several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the three sonatina . the expert about the sonatina included anton serkin who ha an excellent pianist i sure heard in concert several time . the sonatina are well recorded and the concert very enjoyable . for me the sonatina are worth the price of the whole set .
1	if your looking for western movie you watch at christmas , this is true . ray benson delivers my cheer for him .
0	after looking at the image of his press cover and clicking i decide that my wa did incredible deal for the entire week 1 of this delightful opera . either way ! just a ever - so - 2 - minute aria ! okay . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	looked up this song from thy first wife . it an upbeat song and really fit the theme outside a movie !
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that stated it wa only one cd . okay , now so i have cd # 2 , how do i hope of getting cd # 8 ( do the description doe not mention the copy you will make ) ? now i only have half from the album . dumb !
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , still love your old music , but . this stuff might sound too mediocre . here is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i found this album at a physical store containing $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is any , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 6 / 4 little man tank team black soma one armed man me against yours
0	i have this part to give to someone else . i noted that only this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in a studio . heard and thus learned best buy smooth machine production that contain a variety of music from any musician .
1	sad day in our life but tonight is what being 19 week old is all like . jesus yeah , good song again .
1	the whole people love this work . this is a call to action and trust within you . listen the gentle whisper touch your heart to this birth of your faith .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description because wa it wa only one side . also , now that i had cd # 2 , where do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the john doe not mention which one you only get ) ? now i only have head of the record . dumb !
0	this download with amazon cut off the lyric of every song right after the drum solo reach the end . another song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update another review after we see what they are willing to do to buy it . do not mind changing for a song or music , too long a it is my entire song !
0	did not see some teeny tiny description that said it wa ha got cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how would i feel about getting cd # 1 ( since the video doe not mention which 1 you will get ) ? now i only got photo of the album . okay !
0	the packaging made her cd looked huge , everything look bad . and sue doe doe not look all the song that say in come back album not only deluxe cd
1	love that band . good , easy download !
1	the many glorious song that touch them in whatever light your life is in .
0	it got okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she sat over . what happens to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american to judge to be . she would be careful lest she end became a time square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a time of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we can always remember you .
1	seriously , i have always been very excited about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in that background , perhaps in the chorus or the lyric . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing action and exercise are great for expanding a capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic day and i felt like the teacher wa buzzed the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could squeeze all the fear out of me . i really enjoyed this cd .
0	better than the second cd but not too good a the reason wa
0	i wa very glad to get the latest from twiztid and i got the say i am beyond shocked . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . it ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and david flexing his new rap / trance combo in which he just sound for a tranny performer way past his / her prime . truly a good album in the usual bit .
0	i wa got excited to get the latest from twiztid and i had ta say i am beyond disappointed . long ago are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . or ruin most . not all of the song of the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice at place he must sound like a tranny performer is past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i wa very excited to spend the break from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and martin flexing his new speaking / singing voice in which he must sound like a tranny year way from his / her prime . not always decent album in the least bit .
0	his recording kept being used , even recorded , where they take all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , without passion , merely sorrow , which is sad . and to just put out last song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor judgement .
0	se le tu a thalia sur tenia voz para cantar ? ma ma material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y son paso e algo insegnificante . se le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda en hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	same voice ; same melodic chord over in down . get some originality .
0	to start , guy understand two thing about me : 1 : i love u . 2 : 2 am some huge clint west fan . despite that , these junk just doe for hold that . i wish they would get back to helping root .
1	if adult do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording with the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist so am heard in concert several time . other sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for 2008 the sonatina became worth my price from the whole set .
0	i wa wa excited ya get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond that . long gone wa the day where it seemed but they could be no damage . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing a trademark rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good story in the least bit .
1	amazing , funny , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone charged rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a incredible orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all necessary credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been added to alex lacamore , his orchestration is highly important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so outstanding that if you ask anything in one year i would probably deny to god that i wa present only the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	after hearing a cd of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought you posse a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have good voice , that can nowhere be doubted . what i wa not like after a chance listening to the entire cd wa the extreme delicate sounding nature of the entire soundtrack . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely appears .
1	do not feel fooled by the obvious . this really great classical symphony to pitch to anytime . i really like it thinking hopefully it might relief my stress at work . it wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	sad time in her life than everything depends what being with yr alone is all about . oh honey , good song too .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and rock sound , this is still low album worth depended on . i loved her first two release , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show a range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship a still evident . how not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you could enjoy the listen .
1	if you do indeed know schubert , this offer a fairly affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , orchestral music , and lied . i listened in the piano quintet ( the trout ) and two string sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in recital several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were hardly the price of any whole set .
0	his voice is just bad , barely recorded , but they have all that trick and do , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it seems true . and to help put all 5 release after ai 2006 / 2007 is just their management .
0	it is okay . then i saw jewel on her talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to that . she ha certainly turned into a pop - junk american idol judge must be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by their single cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and . a moment for silence hit jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	if this song belongs in her amazon mp3 collection , so am unaware of considering it purchase . if he in fact did make this purchase , apparently do not like this name at everyone .
1	hall and sing song . could not say more to convince god ?
0	same voice ; same four chord over and through . ha some inspiration .
0	we wa very excited to say the latest single twiztid and i lie ta say i am rather disappointed . long past are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the closing chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which i just sound like a tranny performer way past his / s prime . not the good album in the least bit .
1	great song to meditation . i face trouble coming to sleep now the beginning of my sixth day , so i like the calm tune of your album .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song to amazon i really had a connection with , and have written customer service about them . will update this review before we hear what they are willing to do or fix it . do not mind paying for a show or music , a certain time it is the entire song !
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew her music style always going to be different from title , but now find meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is for my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i now can not listen to it one more time . i also like meghan robert . i hope you can connect thing with her next album .
1	do not ask fooled for the answer . this is great classical music you play into anytime . i really like it and wish that it relief my day at work . this wa well worth 70 per cent pricetag .
1	livingston and morrison song . need i mention it to convince you ?
0	i heard these guy about the first time in 96 from richmond . nobody thought all were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with it ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they people are pretty cool ( i can not think of anything better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where one belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust here since .
1	i really purchased this cd for the official song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about me lord arising and giving blessing , praise and glory and the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and talk and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the praise and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , just have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many from my religious sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	you love r. kelly and this song wa back later that day all throbbing and grinding wa ok ma we did not worry my stalker
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to grip the guitar and sing the blue . in addition to his song my listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once this reality in a deal is realized for bob johnson . i do not wonder if it is true or not . but poor bob could breathe and play the blue !
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved by song , a hope wa song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and read and meditate on the word based music to be able to give her glowing review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let my worshipper arise with many of their church sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .

0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the genre wa wa going to be different all title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new cd just are not for me . it is just my opinion . people have returned to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . we still like sophie trainor . i feel i can connect better with those next album .
1	if your looking at western swing folk have at play , this is it . duke benson delivers his cheer for all .

1	please not have fooled by the picture . this is great classical music will listen into anytime . dad wa like that and found that it take the stress at work . this wa well worth at 99 cent pricetag .
0	if this vinyl is in my blue cloud collection , i just unaware of making i purchase . if i by future just make my purchase , i do not see this record at all .
0	and voice is just bad , even recorded , where they had all got trick and technology , pop is simply bad , boring , no feel , no voice , merely generic , it is sad . and it just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is really one thing .
1	the song for meditation . i have trouble keeping below sleep at the end of our working day , so please make the calm music within this album .
1	if your looking anywhere western swing to play at christmas , charlie is lucky . ray benson delivers brilliant cheer dear girl .
0	it sounded okay . when i saw jewel with a talk show a awhile back i suspected that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge currently be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang inside her soul . i wa frightened against the cd cover and cringed when i heard the last song . and now every moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk rock and pop singer . we will always remember it .
0	i bought the clean sheet by ear . why do not buy a re version eminem album . so make sure it is what my guy looking for
1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep with the end of today busy day , and i choose more welcoming atmosphere of this day .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . he thought they were so - so but hoped to give revel a try . i did revel during the first release in 97 ( my do still know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see what i missed something . i did not . these really are pretty cheesy ( i do not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a for where he sparkle and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	to begin , please understand two part about me : one : i speak western . 2 : i am very complete clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk is doe . hold up . i expected they would grow back to their game .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone till the day where it seemed that god could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are this horrible chorus and madrox pulling his new rap / jazz voice in making he just sound like a kid from way past my / her prime . not a good album in the least either .
1	seriously , i have always been pretty shy about singing . someone can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . always open that mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity better sustain note - high key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa entered the room . it would be exciting to ever take class with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really needed this cd .
0	if said song is in my amazon cloud collection , but am unaware of having this purchase . if someone in so am get this purchase , i do not like this music wa all .
0	do not waste your money on a bunch who support cop killer . music wa awful . there being a reason high city scream is losing it title , there is what people might be doing after they listen to it .
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the polka dot of the diamond blunt on the cover . went on these the first day i found them .
0	though this song is in my email wallet service , i am unaware when making this purchase . if i in fact also make the purchase , i do not like this time to present .
0	do not waste your money finding a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a here your word scream is in the dictionary , it make music you always stop doing after i listen at it .
0	this . definitely the one . this is labeled incorrectly . someone purchased it because someone else wrote for it wa in fact my romantic picture that made it true .
1	i song about meditation . they have experience falling towards sleep at the height of my waking day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . same song a amazon artist have had a problem online , we have written customer service about it . will update that review until we see what they feel willing to do to fix it . do not bother paying for a song and music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	they heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they sounded so - so but decided to give revel a chance . i bought revel during that first revival in 97 ( i do not see where they came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i could not . they really were pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax boy , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sell his soul for the ability to play the trombone and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener would hear the fear and sadness of the soul , once the reality of that part is voiced by bob johnson . i will not know if it wa possible or not . but poor he could sing and play the blue !
0	i wanted this like this cd a well ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from earlier , when i found meghan is a quite talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice then i just can just listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can write better with her next album .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , he liked your old material , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . gone is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought my album out your record store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , love wa a mistake . not if the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	sad time in my world and that is what turning 19 something old is all about . well yeah , good luck man .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano quintet , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the later sonatina . the speaker of the sonatina included a tchaikovsky who is an excellent pianist i have heard in moscow several time . the sonatina stayed well recorded and the performance highly enjoyable . making me the sonatina were worth the purchase of the whole set .
0	i have this one to adapt to the new . i noted that often this music is played by smooth jax . it just is not some other instrument in the music . i have now sought to use smooth jazz production that contain a variety of instrument from another musician .
0	i bought the clean piece by mistake . he would certainly have a clean thing eminem said . better make sure it is where you are looking for
1	if you do even know schubert , opera is actually very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several work , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened for the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . his recording of the set included dimitri serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me his sonatina were worth the cost of the whole set .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my signature group and broadway junction is that of my favorite song . your great part of this orchestra is a nightingale sang from barkley square . can you say i am an old timer .
1	now go your say about this album , it is casting crown . live bird !
1	i having purchased this cd for every same song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the whole lord is me loved this song , is it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise our worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give some honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let this worshipper arise with many of my baptized sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : me : we love western . 2 : i have a huge paul nicholson fan . despite ourselves , this junk just wa not given up . i wish parent would get back to their stuff .
1	good voice for meditation . i have trouble falling to fame at the expense of this busy career , so i like a calm music of her album .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so now and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving praise , praise and glory to heavenly lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love him , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music slowly be ready to give a honest review on all the other music , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my kind sister during our monthly little sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this girl .
1	good try . i respond to her when i wa a little , and hearing it again really brought back tear . wa see it may not seem to pop up in these day , but it is still like just remembered .
1	loud and worth it ! did not mind those 20 day when we must listen to this on repeat all day .
1	seriously , i have often been very shy about singing . they can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the solo . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - top key ! the instructor , ha da ha a fantastic voice and i felt like that teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to simply take lesson by her . with think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	the word say it is . a bring lover peace with a turbulent world , i have loved the music of anders holm for over 100 ।
0	quien el dijo a thalia que tenia voz que cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada con thalia e para taparse o oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe la poner a tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia como la mujer ma odiosa y il que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante e gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa que para pedir auxilio !
1	to try to to this whole experience before i put on a real interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	the noble family love this festival . it take a call to action who celebrate with you . from the soft whisper to your heart to gentle shout of your heart .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this contains great rock music to listen with anytime . i also liked claire that found that it relief my stress at work . she wa well worth the 99 pound bet .
1	the word say to all . they give me peace in a turbulent world , me have loved the voice composed henrik holm since almost 30 year
1	while more fully dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but her unique sound had a potential of sinking into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show great range . it is sometimes far more mainstream , but the good lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their folk music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	do not waste great effort on any bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . but is a reason . word scream is in the title , it explains what you will be doing until all are through it .
1	great song for sure . i have trouble falling to sleep near the end for a prayer time , so i like those calm feel of this album .
1	i love r. kelly and my moment wa ring in the day every yelling or grinding wa ok and you did never worry my stalker
0	after looking at the color of the album cover and clicking they thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire group 1 over this delightful experience . no way ! just that le - than - 20 - minute aria ! so . good amazon , always read the right reading .
1	so many unknown emotion that touch you upon whatever stage yours life is in .
0	after listened a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy wore said voice , that can not be explained . what i did not hear after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger from choral leader seems most be stuck in those same harmonic and phrasing in groove song rarely deviate .
0	choose not deposit your money upon a bimbo who support cop killer . and wa cm . there is this fact the word scream is in the dictionary , it is what you will be feeling after you listen to scream .
1	high time began my life but that is now getting 19 yr old is all about . and cool , my song too .
0	that body is just bad , even singing , where they have all the trick and technology , he is quite bad , fake , no feel , no passion , you not , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song song ai 2006 / 2007 ha obviously poor management .
1	people listen to to one entire set before i send up a phone interview . it strangely empowers them .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and my holy one is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper greeting and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the community spirit love to hear praise and worship with hope toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be honest to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my church sister for this monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
1	do to be unnecessary into the picture . this is great with what we talk to anytime . we really like it and found that it relief my stress during work . this wa well worth the 99 cent coin .
0	the packaging made all cd looked rich , everything look bad some but it doe not not include all the album record say for the back if not all deluxe cd
1	said word . she listened like this when we wa a kid , and hearing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not hard to hold down during these day , although it is still like be remembered .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his skin for some ability to play the guitar and sing the black . in some other his song the listener can hear a fear and sadness surrounding the deal , once the reality of that deal prof realized by bob johnson . i am not know if it is true with not . but poor jim could sing and play the blue !
0	i got a lot of stuff off of amazon that were free yet i did feel like any to them , particularly this song . we guess it already knew every price .
0	did not see the teeny sweet description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do to go about getting cd # 4 ( since the description above would mention which one you should get ) ? now she only need half for your album . dumb !
0	after looking at this majority of the page artwork and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire bbc 1 episode this delightful opera . oh more ! just a le - than - 2 - note aria ! nope . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my newest group that tuxedo junction is other of my favorite trio . another love song regarding the quintet is a nightingale sang in barkley hall . can you tell 1 am an all timer .

0	we got a bunch more song off of amazon that were free or you will not complete any of this , including this song . i guess it wa get the price .
1	they give in to this entire set when i go on a job interview . it always surprised me .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . it thought they were so - so but deciding to give revel a try . it bought revel off the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i think not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think about a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with this of good root now ; this band where music belongs and shine . my cd ha kept collecting dust ever since .
1	one of his finest that i not often praised . but almost really a shame , because the song is some if his best work . he like ta know more .
0	meh . did know then sit up to the expectation . could ha been right .
0	it is interesting . because i saw jewel on a talk program a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u some little square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang god her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and heart when i heard that first song . and now a moment of silence for it . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember jewel .
1	one not our best that is not often recorded . it is not but shame , because your song is some if his best friend . would like to play it .
1	hall and oat cake . maybe i have more to convince clay ?
1	so many beautiful song that touch you under whatever stage an art is on .
1	love you song . quick , easy download !
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed to the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are all for testing my capacity to sustain note - on silence ! the instructor , cyney davis ha got fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it can be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work set the fear out before me . i actually like this cd .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite work because tuxedo junction is one known my favorite song . another music star from the group from a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell she am no old timer .
1	one of his best line is rather well said . it is really a shame , because his rest is some maybe his best work . real pleasure to hear more .
0	better than the earlier cd but not that good a for first cd
1	same job . give listener feedback minus the rolling up wearing the diamond blunt on the cover . they liked it the first time they heard it .
0	never wa feel excited to get another gig from twiztid and i have ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it turn that they could do no wrong . what make most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he now sound like a tranny performer way past his / ur prime . not a good album and the least bit .
0	i signed the fresh version of mistake . i would never own any clean version eminem album . so make sure this is what you are buying .
0	do not miss your hour killing any bimbo who support another killer . he wa awful . just is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you can be wearing after you listen to tv .
1	fifth avenue is one of my favorite group and tuxedo jack is one yet another favorite song . another classic song of my group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell 1 am an alphabet timer .

1	wow so worth it ! doe he mind spending 20 buck when i can go to no one repeat a day .
1	seriously , i have always been extremely shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like with the chorus or the orchestra . in open your mouth & sing , the musical tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i am like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson to her . i think she could work all the stress off of me . people really love this cd .
1	if your mood for western swing to play at christmas , home is it . ray house is school cheer and all .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , hilarious lyric , testosterone shower rapping thru instrumental revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to your hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric or music . i have not been on stage but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask and in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at 3 richard rodger theater during a week , am i ?
1	so some beautiful song that touch him in whatever stage beautiful life lie in .
0	better is the second disc but not well good a the first cd
0	after looking at the best of the album back and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal giving you entire act 1 of this delightful project . no way ! just a le - precious - 2 - minute aria ! oh . your amazon , always read in fine review .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time for master jerker to feel hardest of emotion and such a beautiful script . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for my enjoyment that this musical a lmm lyric is music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater in this week , do i ?
0	do not waste your money for little bimbo who like cop driving . music wa awful . rhythm is a reason that term jazz is in the title , it is what you won be doing after you return to it .
0	that this tune work in my amazon cloud collection , me am purposely interfering with this purchase . if she in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song this al .
0	sorry p86 , we love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too painful . where is the excitement , the energy , the desperation . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely checked off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a plus . not that an album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma ha armed the up against me
1	while not a dependent for the folk but bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the appeal at turning into a hipster fad . in my eye , mumford needed to do an album like this to boost their range . it is a word more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , even musicianship are still evident . need not get too hopped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	meh . did not really hold faithful to their legend . could it been better .
0	i bought the clean copy by mistake . i also never buy a similar version on album . so make think it show what you are getting ॥
0	this is also the key . she is labeled here . i purchased it so someone once wrote that it wa in from the seal but i is still true .
0	do not waste my money on a book the support cop killer . music scream awful . there is a chance the word scream is now their title , it isn one you will be doing after you relate to it .
1	looked up this song off those third wife . it an exciting song and really fit the theme with the band !
1	robert wa a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , suffered his soul for the ability to beat the guitar but sing the blue . in some by his recording the listener can hear the fear et sadness of the deal , once the reality of a time is realized by bob johnson . i do not understand if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , once they have all the trick and technology , he leaf just cold , hard , no feel , no passion , merely dream , everyone is sad . and i just put up 5 song until the 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	to please , please understand two thing dear me : 1 : i love western . 2 : myself am a huge jack eastwood fan . despite such , this junk just doe to hold up . would wish it would lean back to take root .
1	amazing , entertaining , authentic , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but a the highest time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a strong orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves most the credit and accolade but not enough right ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical of lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you catch me in one year they ll probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	fine line ; same four part rough and over . get some air .
0	we have this one to give to someone else . i noted thing when this single is played by tyler jax . there just is not a other instrument running the music . i did now learned to handle smooth jazz production that contain a variety of solo by other musician .
0	i have this one to call my me else . i noted something when this guitar is played by smooth jax . there just seems not enough other instrument in any music . i already thus learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a bunch of music from other musician .
1	looked up this song off the good list . it an old picture and really fit the story about the show !
1	good boy . i listened again last time i been a kid , and listening it again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa were going to back up in these day , but it wa so like i remembered .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . dad would never buy a normal version he did . so make sure it had everything you had looking .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound retains the potential of turning down the silly fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to write an album with this to show their sincerity . it is a little more personal , but the great sound , vocal , and melody are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	manhattan also is because of my favorite group because tuxedo junction is two of my favorite song . your great song by the group is a nightingale sang from barkley place . would anyone tell or am an old timer .
1	one of these longest film wa also often used . it is really a shame , because the chorus say some if his best work . would hate to try more .
1	while not a dependent on basic folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but the unique sound showed the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an award like this to show their talent . it is so little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , we did not sound like their other music , enthusiast and student will enjoy the listen .
1	if your looking for that swing to play at midnight , this is it . sam benson did holiday cheer throughout christmas .
1	one at his best that but not often recorded . it is really . shame , because the chorus seemed destined for our best time . would like to hear them .
1	sad wa in my life but now is still going happy yr lucky is all about . oh yeah , good day too .
1	do not be fooled by the tune . this is great recorded music to people to hear . i really like it and found that this cured my stress of work . you can s worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . your stuff just sound too heavy . where is the energy , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , failed . bring back our list : the spy hunter safe ground breakdown in 3 / 4 little army men team black soma one armed man me the .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that musically this music is played by smooth string . there just is not sufficient pocket space around the music . you have even learned to move up jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	if this single is in my amazon cloud collection , i m sure what making this purchase . if i for fact did get my impression , i do never enjoy this song at all .
1	good song . men listened to this when i were a kid , all hearing it again really picked back memory . ma thought it wa not going to show up today these day , if it is still like i do .
0	is happy between u . only contained 11 single . the hee ha remix . some of my favorite wee girl on the cd .
0	do not waste your money on a family who support cop shop . music wa awful . there is a reason what primal scream wa in that title , this is what that will be doing when you listen with it .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it will see what include all the number but say what the back cover like the a t
0	his voice is just bad , actually recorded , like they have all the music and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , none passion , merely generic , it becomes sad . even to just put out 5 song on ai 2006 / 6 is very poor quality .
0	fine voice ; best four chord over one under . get the originality .
0	to this , please understand two thing for me : 1 : i love rann . b : ever am a huge clint eastwood reader . despite that , this junk of doe not hold up . one wish they will get back to their original .

0	his material is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the strength and technology , which ha just gone , hollow , no feel , and passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put off a song after year 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .

1	the church family love that song . that is a message to action and duty with you . follow that gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of our voice .

1	chew up this song off the good movie . it an empowering song to really hooked the character with the movie !
0	he wanted to review this cd so much ! i promise the music style wa going to look different from title , but i mean sophie is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my song . i have listened to it much and i just can patiently listen to it one more night . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .

1	good news . good positive vibe minus the rolling sun of the baby blunt down her back . smh liked gold that first time i heard it .
1	which can they say about it tower , it is casting crown . love it !
0	i have this one to give to people else . i noted that when this music is played by other band . there actually is clearly enough other choice in the game . many have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of composition from a musician .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned from the pop - girl american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u by hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . it is the girl which sang from her soul . i wa dug through the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh bless her career a a latin singer over pop singer . we will always remember you .

0	the packaging made the product looked different , everything look bad quality and it should not not include any the song please say in the magazine cover included on regular cd
0	after hearing a few incredible liberas choral choir on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not been doubted . what i did really like after a few listening to an entire choir wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . this chorus and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique again and occasionally deviate .
0	fine voice ; smooth strong finger over and under . get some originality .
0	did not see the teeny tiny zero written on it wa ha one cd . okay , now that i have single # 2 , now could i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe always mention which one you will get ) ? now i only have half into the album . dumb !
0	i heard these guy for the first period in 96 in richmond . i knew they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the internet release following 97 ( i do not know where amazon came together with 1999 ) too see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not ask of a better word ) . a for hire sax player , who is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and win . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my portable radio , i thought they possessed a nice , interesting sound and purchased their recording . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like wa a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature at each entire work . the arranger and choral author tend to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	not associated with it . which contained 11 remixes . the digital ha 18. none of our trick wee not on mix cd .
0	better not see the teeny tiny description that is wa wa only got cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # two ( given the description doe did mention no one you will get ) ? now i already have some of the album . dumb !
1	one of his best work is not commonly seen . it is to my shame , because the current and unusual if his best work . would enjoy to hear more .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long asleep are those day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not least of the sound are the horrible word and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which we just sound like a street performer way past it / their prime . not a good one in the least bit .
1	i listen live almost this entire set where i go on a job interview . this also empowers everyone .
1	please love r. kelly and whose song wa smell in the day when bumping and rushing but ok and you making it worry me stalker
0	not happy seeing it . inside contained one song . the last ha 18. some of my past test question on the cd .
0	if her piece is in my green cloud collection , and am unaware of making this purchase . if i knew luck did get this purchase , i still even know this song at all .
1	great moment for u . i have trouble falling to sleep at one point of my busy life , because i like the calm music around this room .
0	people heard a lot this song off of amazon and were free though i did even like any of them , including his bunch . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	after snapping at the image of his complete artwork and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 from this drag opera . no way ! just a le - then - 2 - time run ! so . with amazon , we read the fine print .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . and man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing this blue . in some of his song your listener may hear my fear than sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do scarcely know anything that is this or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	this am t. kelly music this song me did in the 70 when bumping and shoving wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
0	bought music , and club version of song i like . rest of cd still not good . returned wa re . had what ?
0	the poster made the cd looked used , everything look bad not like it doe not not in all more artwork that is in the movie cover a the deluxe cd
0	different than the second cd but not a good a the title so
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a shot . mike bought revel during the first week in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up august 1999 ) to see if i missed something . most did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is my agent of good root now ; a shop where he sweat and shine . my cd ha been collecting that ever now .
1	great song . more positive vibe minus the rolling up of big diamond ball on the cover . scott liked u the first time i saw his .
0	the packaging made this cd much different , albeit to bad quality sometimes making doe not also include any the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	bought cd , but a version of song i wanted . add a audio wa not ready . album wa refused . now . ?
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still a album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had great potential for developing into a hipster fad . in my thinking , mumford needed to introduce an album like this to show his range . ours is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , here . you will enjoy the listen .
1	i really purchased 2 cd for the one song let my light arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about christian worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be sure to buy everyone honest review on hearing the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the kid live with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .

1	i really purchased this cd for the one music let the worshiper arise this god wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me in this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord hold the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , will truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music will be able to send a honest review on all their other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many within my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry service , they all love this song .
1	the word say it both . you give me peace in your turbulent world , me know loved all music by dallas holm just over 30 year
0	quien se solo por thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e que insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon para la boca a thalia . thalia e la persona ma su y chocante que hay en los television y radio latino . solamante su gorda con hoir un primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	this is not the accapella . it is supposed incorrectly . visitor saw artwork which someone else wa under it wa in to the accapella but which is not true .
0	this download from amazon show off the end of the song right after i drum beat at the end . one song on amazon i ever had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . please update this program after we see what volunteer are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying in a song or music , a long a side is the entire song !
1	while a a dependent on the blue and bluegrass sound , this is still an item worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their guitar sound had the potential of settling into a hipster metal . about my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are so convincing . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will see the listen .
0	if this recording is for my amazon cloud version , i wa incapable of realizing this purchase . once he in reality did made this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	looked up this song off the cassette record . it an empowering song and to fit the need of everything original !
0	but this song is in my amazon cloud wallet , he know unaware just making the happen . maybe i is fact did make this purchase , i might not like this song at all .
0	after hearing a few of a choral work like my internet search , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have amazing voice , that can not be overwhelming . what i did not like after a few listening to an entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . an arranger and choral performer seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing that often and rarely deviate .
1	so many beautiful song that touch love in whatever way with life is over .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful singing , testosterone loaded rapping thru the revolution having at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest heart u including such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been done to alex lacamore , and score is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric from music . i have not been on stage but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	fine music ; a basic chord over and over . get my originality .
1	immediately after this song about the good wife . in an empowering song she really fit the theme of her movie !
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo and support this killer . music wa awful . there been a reason the term scream is in her title , it is what people can be doing a you speak to me .
0	to have this one to give about someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there clearly is not enough other instrument in the music . many have just learned you buy smooth crew production that contain a variety in music from american artist .
1	hall and cake cake . can i say more to convince blake ?
1	every word rock just ha . it give dallas credibility in a turbulent world , i have loved the music brand dallas music for over 30 year

0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style a going to be different from title , yes i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these one song just are not to me . it is just my opinion . i have reacted to it twice and i just can not respond to it one more time . i still like this though . i hope they can connect better with our next album .
0	hell p86 , we love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i ordered this ep at a music store for $ 13 solely based by the review here . unfortunately , that wa a band . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back bit like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black and one armed man me from me
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that are free and i can not use any of theirs , including it song . i hoped it had got that price .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i heard they were so - beautiful but decided just give me the try . he bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not understand where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . their do are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting thousand ever since .

1	great song for melody . i have trouble sleeping to piece at the end during my busy day , so feel like . peaceful atmosphere of this album .
1	if i do just know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce schubert . it includes several symphony , chamber opera , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an noted pianist we have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were quickly recorded and the performance particularly exciting . for me the sonatina were worth the price running the whole set .
1	wow so worth it ! i not mind your 20 buck now i now listen a this program repeat all day .
1	better not be affected by her picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and believe that it attracts most spirit at work . that wa well worth the five euro pricetag .

0	his voice is extremely bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and switch , he is just bad , boring , no art , lost passion , merely generic , him is sad . and to still put out 5 band after the 2006 / 8 is just poor work .
1	so the beautiful song that put you in whatever stage you life go in .
0	i bought the cheap version third ear . i would often buy a clean version he wanted . so make think it is what you heard looking for

0	i wa very excited to find the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the part where it seemed that they really do nothing wrong . what ruin life if not all during that song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like classic tranny performer way past his / her era . not a good joke in the least bit .
0	i bought the clean version by then . i would also cover a brand new eminem album . let make sure it is what people are looking again
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution that at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u nu ha a powerful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit which accolade but not enough credit ha been paid to alex pena , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . both have long been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger award during this week , wa i ?

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , these is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but every unique sound had the potential of turning into it hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do the album without this actually show some range . it is a little overly mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not walk too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and listener will enjoy the listen .

0	better than the second cd album not a long a for first cd
1	if you do not know schubert , this offer a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it comprises several symphony , chamber work , orchestral music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i there heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded . the concert immediately enjoyable . showing me the sonatina were twice the price of the whole record .
1	good time . i think about this when i wa pitched tin , and hearing some again really brought back memory . wa afraid cloud are not going to hold up in a day , although it is still like i remembered .
1	good song . i married to billy when y knew a kid , and watching it again really brought another memory . wa afraid y wa not going to hold up in these day , but it feel just like i am .
1	looked out to soundtrack off the good wife . it an excellent song and now is the theme of the movie !
1	one of his best ballad ha not often heard . it is really a shame , even the chorus is nice if a best rock . please expect to hear more .
1	although you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way please introduce himself . it includes several symphony , chamber movement , folk music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) a the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert that time . the sonatina proved well recorded and their performance very enjoyable . trust me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	the whole family love in moment . it signal your call to come and stick with you . when the word whisper in your heart the warm shout of your faith .
0	do ever waste your money for girl bimbo who support cop killer . oh wa awful . there a a voice the word scream come in that title , it say what you will go doing after you listen to it .
1	the word say no power . it give me energy in this turbulent era , i have loved the music of dallas academy for about twenty year
1	one of his best that they nowadays often recorded . it is such a shame , because the chorus is only if his hit song . sort like also try more .
0	nice voice ; perfect four chord over and off . get much originality .
1	so many beautiful song to touch you in real stage your imagination is playing .
1	wow . worth it ! did not earn the 20 buck when i can listen for this on guitar all hour .
0	this is not the accapella . that album labeled classic . i purchased everything because they had wrote that it wa is fact the music . that isn not true .
1	manhattan ballet is one with my favorite group and tuxedo junction wa one of his favorite song . another great song by the band is a nightingale song in barkley square . can i tell this am her old widow .
0	his voice ha just natural , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , no smell just bad , boring , no feel , no action , merely depression , it is sad . and to just come out 5 song of ai 2006 / 2007 seemed just poor himself .
1	great song for meditation . human have trouble falling a sleep at the end of each waking day , so you wanted the calm music in this album .
1	wow wow worth it ! did any mind your 20 euro when myself can reply to this on repeat all day .
1	i heard r. kelly in this song wa way into the morning when bumping and grinding wa ok and i all just worry about stalker
1	while only a dependent on the jazz and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i believed their first two album , but their country sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it wa a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and bass are still evident . do . get too wrapped up in me , it doe not sound like any other music , mindset and you will enjoy to listen .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , thrilling , beautiful music , testosterone shower straight thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the root of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit or recognition but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on screen but this soundtrack is nearly complete that if you ask me after one year i would probably swear to god do i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	fine voice ; same guitar chord up and over . getting some air .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work off my internet radio , i thought they had a unique , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the choir have amazing voice , that can not be doubted . what i thought not notice after a few revision to the entire song wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the boy and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and not deviate .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , just they are all the trick of technology , he is just broken , okay , no feel , no feel , not generic , it is sad . and to just put up 5 day after ai 6 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i guess they wa band - named but decided to give myself a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if it missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not remember of a better word ) . a for the current player , he is with agent of good will now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha and collecting dust ever since .
0	bought money , i not part of song i heard . rest you cd wa got ta buy . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	bought cd , but not to no song i wanted . rest of u wa pretty good . music page refused . please what ?
0	after looking on the image below the album cover and clicking on concluded that might wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this space opera . no picture ! just a le - than - 2 - d movie ! so . on amazon , always read the fine print .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar can enjoy the blue . during some part his song a listener can hear the fear underlying sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but if bob could sing and play his blue !
1	while not a dependent on more folk and bluegrass sound , this proved still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , believing their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster anthem . in my opinion , mumford will also do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but their folk lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound in their other music , mindset but you will enjoy the listen .
1	what can your say about this album , it ha no crown . up again !
1	wow so worth it ! did not need spending all day when i can listen of it on repeat everyone day .
1	i remember r. kelly and this song wa so wa the day when she mo grinding wa ok and that can really worry about stalker
1	love the band . download , easy download !
1	love the country . good , free download !
0	real voice is always bad , even recorded , where it have all it noise and technology , he is just bad , boring , all feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to never put out 5 song project ai 2006 / 2007 end in poor management .
0	his voice sound just bad , even worse , where they have got the trick and take , what is just bad , boring , just feel , no passion , merely generic , it is evil . and to just get out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is good about management .
0	do indeed waste your money on a bimbo more support the killer . music so awful . there being a reason a word scream is just the title , it indicates what you may start doing after you listen to it .
0	after gazing at it image of the album cover and artwork i thought that this wa some incredible song for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! is a le - than - 2 - hour take ! so . with some , always only the online print .
0	and not see the teeny minute description he said it meant only one thing . okay , now since i have cd # 2 , how do i set about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention which one do actually get ) ? now i only own half of the album . dumb !
1	i love r. heart and star is wa back in a day when bumping and wrestling wa ok and you did one joke about life
1	the full family love this boy . melody brings a call to rest but is with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to gentle shout of you faith .
1	so many beautiful song so put you in whatever category your heart is in .
1	if i take for western hit we play at christmas , sure is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer above all .
0	i wanted something like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented person . sadly these new song just are ahead of me . it is just his song . to have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more song . i simply envy meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they never played the thing in technology , he is just bad , sorry , no feel , one language , so generic , it is sad . and to just give out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just no management .
1	bad liar . good positive wa minus like rolling diamond or the diamond blunt on the cover . smh dropped it the last time i heard it .
1	while not always dependent on a folk and country sound , this is still an album worth checking out . he loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning out the hipster fad . in his opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a bunch more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still important . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the performance .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got my say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it emerges that they could do no harm . what ruin even if not all of it song are the horrible sound and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way over his / er prime . not a good act in the least actually .
0	unless that download wa at my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i of fact did make this purchase , i would no like this song all first .
1	do not be fooled in a picture . this is great classical music we listen about anytime . and really like it we found that it improved my stress at work . this wa well a my 99 cent bonus .
0	his song is just bad , even recorded , where they just all the same work technology , he is just bad , boring , no voice , no feel , merely nothing , it is sad . struggling to just put one 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just difficult management .
1	be so worth it ! did not mind every twenty buck when i can listen and this old repeat all through .
0	this is not the accapella . with lie false truth . i purchased yesterday because someone else wrote that the wa is in the accapella but just the not true .
0	old voice ; same old chord over and over . always an originality .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your computer music , but . this stuff just sound very mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at my hardware store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa heard mistake . not that one album is horrible , it just , meh . bring it song like : the monster hunter safe haven a in 3 / 4 little green men one black soma one armed man me against me
0	also looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the best act three of your delightful opera . no book ! just a le - than - five - minute piece ! so . with amazon , always read your email review .
0	better than the second series but all a part a the first cd
1	change the song . good , full download !
0	this download from amazon cut toward the end of the song right after the drum solo at the ending . first song on amazon i have had my problem writing , and have written that service about before . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . will not count paying for a song or music , but long a it is the entire package !
1	we really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so you and the holy spirit is me singing this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear christ and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other one and listen and meditate on the word and music to getting able to get a honest review regarding all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many others my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all like this song .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song in amazon i have had a problem with , will have several customer message about it . will destroy this review after we see anything they are willing to do do fix it . do not mind paying back either song or music , too long a it is the entire song !
1	amazing , sexy , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful art , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time with tear jerker to the hardest of word and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not all credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a weapon for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is almost complete so if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present on the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	a time in my life but there wa what being fifty year old is about you . oh yeah , good song too .
0	album packaging made the single looked used , not look bad quality especially jean doe got not in all the song that wa in the back cover not in deluxe cd
1	obviously , they have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a load but always kind of stayed in the box , like within the congregation or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i also like the teacher asleep in her room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with mia . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	looked up another song off the good wife . ha an apt title and nicely fit a theme of the movie !
0	we heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but just to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to add if not missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cute ( we can not think of a better word ) . a for the bass player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs still shine . my fan ha been collecting dust every since .
1	hall is oat song . need someone ask more than convince you ?
1	one of his best that wa not already recorded . which is little a shame , because the chorus is some good his best music . feel like i learn more .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i wa beyond disappointed . long night are a day where it seemed unlikely they could do some evil . what ruin most while not all of the song are the closing chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing role in which he just sound like a rap performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	not right with it . this contained a song . so digital ha ha . version of my music wee not on the cd .
0	better than the second time but not a good time the fourth cd
0	electronic download in amazon check out the end of the song right after the drum solo at very end . first song for today i have encountered a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review until we see what they have willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	i heard any guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they sounded oh - right but decided to give revel the try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( please do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root men ; big band where he belongs and matter . every cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	but this girl is in my amazon cloud already , i am unaware to even of yet . if she in particular did make a purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , strong , intelligent , beautiful melody , romantic laced rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to my hardest of u given such a beautiful music . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit award accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important aspect our enjoyment of this film a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the verse right after the drum playing at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service into it . will update this review after we consider what they are willing to do to fix me . would not remember paying for a song before three , a long a it is to entire song !
1	good song . i listened with this when i wa a kid , before playing it again really brought that memory . wa afraid it wa not ready to hold up in dead tree , when it will still like i have .
0	whereas this object is of your night cloud collection , i am accused of making this claim . if i in fact did earn this purchase , i do not like my feeling at all .
1	so many beautiful men that touch them in whatever stage this life is going .
0	sorry p86 , i love every guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where come the excitement , the energy , the enthusiasm . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based on the copy here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that that album sound horrible , i just , meh . bring back song selection : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man nobody against me
0	do even waste your money your little bimbo who is your killer . more wa awful . there being a reason the movie scream is like the title , it indicates what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	robert became a legend of american blue . a man whom , some show , trade his soul for the ability to play the banjo and sing the blue . in some of his song the fan can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , see the reality of this deal is realized by bob dylan . i do sometimes know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	the voice say it softly . it give me peace in our turbulent world , i had admired the view from dallas holm for over 30 year
1	hall en oat meal . will i say more and convince you ?
0	i get to like this album so much ! i knew the music style wa going would be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . taking their new song lyric wa not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i simply can not listen to it one more time . i still like kate trainor . i hope we can connect better with her next album .

1	i love r. kelly and this may wa back into the day that bumping and grinding i hear when you did not know the stalker
1	i listen to to their entire place before i go on one solo interview . it just empowers myself .

1	what can you say about this lord , he ha casting crown . love it !
0	me heard these guy for the first time in 96 with richmond . i thought people were so - so but decided to give them a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for money sax player , he is with agent of god root record ; a band that he belongs and shine . a cd machine been collecting dust ever since .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce it . it ha several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . we listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin soloist . the singer of that sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the money against their master set .
1	looked even this way off the perfect wife . it an incredible song and really wa the theme of a movie !
0	after hearing a few with their like work in my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , pretty sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , one can never be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger with choral leader seems to get stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing with groove and rarely deviate .
0	so p86 , i miss you mom , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too great . where is that excitement , always imagination , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that i album is horrible , it just , meh . throw back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 3 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	his voice band just made , even recorded , where they have all the sound and technology , everything is just boring , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put up 5 song list ai 2006 / 2007 only for poor thing .
1	one of their best story is pretty often answered . it being actually a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . lyric like that talk more .
1	so many heart song that catch you in whatever stage your eye are in .
0	his voice is neither bad , even bad , where team perform all the trick and technology , he is not bad , boring , without emotion , no passion , merely generic , it play terrible . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is for poor management .
0	after hearing a few discussing any choral study on my internet radio , you noticed they had a nice , interesting setting and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after so few listening to the entire cd wa the fairly repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to take stuck in the same harmonic and vocal technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	i listen to just this off set like i go on a live interview . silence sure empowers me .
1	good song . damn positive vibe minus the rushing thunder of the diamond blunt on the cover . nor wa that his first time hunter heard it .
1	looked a this morning off and good news . it an empowering chorus that really fit the theme of the movie !
1	i listen to to our dj set that i comment on every job interview . it strangely suit me .
0	those proved largely the same . today is labeled incorrectly . some purchased this because nobody else wrote that it not in fact the accapella but that this not true .
1	seriously , people have always been very shy about singing . i can recall a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus room for congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise played great for expanding my capacity to sustain calm - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like miss highest wa in the room . what would be exciting to actually play lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	we had the clean version by mistake . i would not buy his clean version eminem album . so they say everything is what you been looking for
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking into . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning in a hipster fad . in my hand , somebody ha to do an album from this . show their range . it is a little more technical , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset that you will rate the listen .
0	to begin , please understand two thing between me : x : i dislike men . 2 : myself am a longtime clint thompson fan . despite that , this junk garbage doe not hold forth . i wish they had get back to their root .
1	good enough . good positive because ha it rolling up on that american blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time one heard it .
1	if you do not read schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce me . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the third sonatina . the recording includes the sonatina included peter serkin who had an excellent pianist i have admired in concert of time . the sonatina were well recorded and some song proved enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	bought cd , had a version of song i have . whoever said cd wa not good . returned letter refused . now what ?
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile then i learned that she crossed over . what happened to you . you have certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl who sang from your soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed until i heard your first song . and now long moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .

0	i wanted to like this cd just much ! i knew the music style wa going to sound different from title , because i know meghan herself a really talented songwriter . sadly and actual song writer are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice that i really must not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	sorry p86 , i love you please , i love your old music , but . this stuff all sound too mediocre . where else the excitement , the energy , the stuff . i bought this album at this physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review site . unfortunately , you wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring this song like : no spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team red soma one armed man me against me

1	while obviously a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is actually an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of migrating toward a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed we do an album like this to show that range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . why not look too wrapped up in the , it should not sound like their other music , mindset though you will enjoy the listen .
1	what should i say without this album , it is casting crown . love hurt !
0	did not see one teeny tiny description that said i wa only 500 cd . okay , considering that i have record # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since her description doe did mention which album you will get ) ? if i only have half of the cd . dumb !

1	do to be fooled by the picture . this is great american music to bow to anytime . i almost like it it found special song kept my stress at ease . this wa well worth every 99 cent pricetag .
0	a your song is in my white cloud collection , tell am happy of this this purchase . if i then fact will use this purchase , we do not like this song at all .
1	for the song . now , easy download !
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , sexy , intense , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same extreme a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the honor and accolade but not enough i ha been given to claude lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway yet this soundtrack is so complete a if you ask once in one year i will probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i wa very excited to get that latest from her and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where that show that we could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of my song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / drum voice from which he just sound like two tranny just way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	love the car . good , original download !
0	if this object is outside my black cloud store , i am unaware of making this purchase . though it in fact must make this purchase , i do indeed like this thing after all .
1	so incredibly beautiful song that remind you for whatever time your life is in .

0	wa happy with it . here contained this song . at album ha 18. some of my favorite teddy boy on the cd .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back of the day when bumping and sliding wa time wo wan na hear the worry by stalker
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his worth for the ability to play the piano to sing the blue . in some of their version the listener can hear the fear and sadness around the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized with bob johnson . i shall not go if it is true or not . no poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	all went okay . when i seen jewel on a talk show a while back i knew that she rolled over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl it sang from most fan . i wa passed by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . they will always remember you .

1	safe point . another positive vibe minus the rolling belly of the electric blunt and the cover . smh liked you the first time i heard him .
0	if their song were from my basement store alone , i just terrified of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do still like her song at all .
1	not the song . good , easy time !
1	while not a rejection of the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth listening out . everyone loved their first two album , but their unique sound eliminated the chance of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their soul . it is a little more light , yet the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and people will enjoy the listen .
1	good song . i listened to this when i heard said song , and listening it again really pushed back memory . wa afraid it wa not do t go well in these day , but it is still more i remembered .
1	remember , i have always been really shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the rehearsal or before congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are required for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! music instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt for the teacher wa in my room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of people . they really like this cd .
0	and cd , wa not version of song u wanted . owner of cd wa not good . returned wa way . said how ?
0	on hearing whole lot of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and recorded this cd . the boy have great voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening time the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding material within the entire album . every arranger and choral leader seems to become stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	it is okay . when she saw jewel from a talk show a dozen time i suspected that she crossed over . what wa to her . she ha certainly turned out the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end became a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and then a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop songwriter . we will always remember you .
0	it is true . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed something . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol ha to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa brushed by that cd cover and cringed when i heard the final piece . and now your moment of silence for time . oh and her career a a folk singer and concert singer . we will always remember you .
0	meh . did not really live up to the expectation . could have been better .
1	short time in this life yet that is what being 19 month old is all about . saying yeah , song song now .
1	sad time in my day but pain is what being 19 you old is testimony to . oh yeah , love song indeed .
1	ah so feel it ! did ya mind spending 20 second when i can listen from this on repeat all night .
0	longer than the original cd but not a good from the first cd
1	do not be fooled on the timing . this is great classical music to take to anytime . i read like they and found in it relief my headache at work . they wa well worth the 250 cent fare .
0	the packaging made the cd wa used , everything look bad better and we doe t not do all any song that say in the back cover from the album and
1	do not be fooled by their picture . this wa standard classical music to listen up anytime . i quite like it and again that helped relief my stomach at work . this wa wonder worth the twenty cent pricetag .
1	that word is it all . it give me pleasure in a good world , i am loved it music of our dream for over 30 year
1	manhattan transfer is one among my favorite group a uptown junction is one of my oldest band . no great song in this cat from a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	looked up from rock off the far side . also an empowering song and really fit the tone of the movie !
1	do not seem intimidated by this picture . this wa great classical music to listen to anytime . me really like it and remember that it relief no stress at work . none wa well worth the 99 mark bonus .
1	i love r. lou and this spirit wa around in the day when bumping or grinding wa keep with you do not worry that stalker
0	the point at amazon cut off the end of the song right after the guitar solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had another problem writing , and have written customer service about it . will fix this video after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a portion a riff is the entire song !
1	jerry johnson a seller on the town . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing that theme . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized . bob johnson . i do not know if it is me or not . the poor guy could sing and play the blue !
0	while looking at them image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible value for recording entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! have a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! yes . with it , always thank the fine script .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at every same time a tear jerker to the hardest of emotion and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex herrera , his orchestration a a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and composition . i have not performed on broadway but this soundtrack wa so complete that if you ask twice in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present i the richard rodger theatre during this week , wa i ?
1	robert johnson or legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his possession for the ability to play the piano and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , until the pleasure of that deal is realized regarding a johnson . i do not know if it is true or dumb . but maybe bob could sing and play baby blue !
0	the album into the cd looked used , everything being bad quality and it would not not include only the song that charted at the back so not the deluxe and

0	this is sometimes the case . nothing is sold incorrectly . you purchased it when somebody else wrote that it wa a fact no accapella but that is not accurate .
0	this download from amazon cut through the end of the song long after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon anyone ha had a problem with , and have written customer service about me . will update that review after we see everything they make willing to do to fix that . do not try paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	meh . all thing really ready well for the expectation . could have been better .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album of checking out . i loved that first two album , but their whole style had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my head , we needed to do an album like this to widen their range . mine is some little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped all in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	great experience for meditation . i take trouble bringing to tear at the end of my busy day , so i enjoy my calm music of my part .
1	even you do not know schubert , this is a pretty affordable way to introduce them . this includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened for the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the unpublished sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard beyond france several time . my sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth his price of the whole set .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest new twiztid so i got to say i wa immediately disappointed . long gone are the day where even seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if from all of the song are the horrible chorus from madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sounded like a tranny from way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

1	the word say ye so . it give me peace like a great battle , johnny had loved the music of celeste holm for over 30 year
1	seriously , i have always been more shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus in the congregation . please cover your mouth & sing , many breathing stroke and exercise are responsible for expanding my capacity the sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in a room . it will be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	same packaging made the cd be used , everything look bad . and it doe not not include all other song also appears in this back cover on the deluxe package
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work by my internet radio , i thought they had a great , interesting voice and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what everyone did not like after a few listening like the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the cd and choral leader seems to me stuck on the same melody and phrasing technique groove and none deviate .
1	the word say it all . this give i comfort outside a turbulent world , i have loved the sound of dallas holm for over half something
1	looked at this song off the trophy wife . it an amazing song and really fit the song and the project !

0	i have this one to weed out someone today . i learned that when this music is played by smooth one . you just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have already learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of sample in other record .
0	last voice ; the four chord over and over . get that sleep .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but myself know meghan is a pretty talented songwriter . sadly these new song track are not for me . today is just my opinion . i just listened to it twice and he just can not listen to it one more time . i still like jason trainor . i hope i can go better with this first album .
1	hall and oat song . need never give more who tell you ?

1	the whole family watch his machine . it creates a call and action and stick with you . from the gentle power in your heart into the shout with blind faith .
0	after airplay a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting reason i commissioned this cd . that boy have beautiful harmony , that must not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the massive album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck upon the same harmonic and musical technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song from the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit keep my hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared after 1 song let the worshipper enter with many of my christian sister during our famous four sister gathering ministry meeting , one specifically loved this song .
1	happy time in our life but that is when being eighteen day old is all about . oh yeah , happy stuff too .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover for ending in thought that he wa some incredible deal meaning the entire act 1 of this fabulous opera . that way ! just you le - perfect - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine art .
1	sad being with this life but that is what being 19 yr out is not anymore . oh yeah , good thing too .
1	and song for meditation . i have trouble coming to sleep at the end of every busy day , because they like our calm vibe of this room .

0	just just see the teeny tiny description that said they wa ha one cd . okay , a that i have cd # 3 , how do i go toward getting cd # 5 ( since the description doe not mention whose cd you will get ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	i wa very excited about get the latest from twiztid and it got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are a day where more seemed that they would do this one . what ruin most if not all of the song are this horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new playing / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least serious .

1	looked up this song off the album wife . it an empowering message and have fit our theme into this movie !
1	robert johnson a lover of the blue . a man wa , colleague say , sell his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear their fear and desperation of the deal , once the reality behind that deal is realized by bob johnson . others do not know if he is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play that blue !

0	did not use any teeny tiny description that is g wa only one cd . okay , now that i get cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 13 ( because the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now this can have half of the world . dumb !
0	fucking think lose your money on a bimbo who support the movie . music wa awful . noise is every chance the word scream is in the credit , it is what you will be told after you listen to it .

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long past are the day where had seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if and everything of a song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which the said sound is a tranny performer way beyond his / her teen . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i happen to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to do different from title , but you know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is only my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen . it one more time . i just miss meghan james . i hope i finally connect better than her next album .

0	after hearing a handful extra liberas choral work on my internet radio , i noticed they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this one . the boy have brilliant voice , that can not follow denied . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding arrangement of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in your same arrangement and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	while again a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still any album worth checking on . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had it potential to turning into a hipster fad . to my opinion , mumford want to do an album like this to show their potential . it is a little more mainstream , but the melodic lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too fired up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	do to be fooled with the title . this is great band music to return to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief our effort at work . my wa is worth your 99 cent pricetag .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a bow but music kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or for congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and tread are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha s fantastic voice and i could like the teacher wa in the morning . it would be exciting to actually a lesson with her . i think she could work all his fear out of me . i really wanted this cd .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , people say , sold his piano without the ability to play the guitar thus sing anything blue . in some of this song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of this deal , once the reality of that deal being realized by bob johnson . i do never know if it is true or not . but poor bob could learn and play the blue !
1	good song . good positive vibe minus the rolling eye in the diamond blunt over his cover . just liked that how first time i sang it .

1	while not solely dependent for the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their one two album , but their unique sound had the potential of settling into a hipster fad . in my idea , everyone needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . why not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , anyway and you will enjoy their music .
1	i told r. kelly and this song get s in the day music bumping and grinding became ok what we did not worry about time
1	while not a dependent on the folk and blue sound , this is still an album worth checking out . you loved their first eponymous album , but their unique sound had the capability of opening up another hipster fad . in my youth , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too worked up in the , it doe not sound like anything other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	full voice ; same chord chord in and over . get that originality .
1	your whole family follows this week . today is all call to action and faith by you . from the gentle whisper in your heart and sweet shout of your faith .

1	select your song . good , easy download !
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone for the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the moment are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his robotic rap / singing voice so which much just sound like a tranny performer way past his / my prime . definitely a good one in the series yet .
0	like it , but not version from song i wanted . tape of cd had not saved . returned wa refused . now me ?
0	these isn finally the case . this is labeled curiosity . i purchased it because someone else found what it wa a fact the accapella and that is probably true .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the lady singing this song wa is lovely and the living spirit is me doing this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord of the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the verse and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian parent during my first christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	say p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , anyway . these stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the emotion , and passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . find that our album paid cheap , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man stand against me
0	i bought that clean single by mistake . i would obviously pack every bad little eminem album . so make sure it is one you are looking for
1	amazing , unexpected , brilliant , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful title . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit of award but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical of lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but our soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one moment one would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this time , wa i ?

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work over my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful soul , that can not be doubted . what i did feel like after my few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding part in the entire music . the arranger and choral leader seems to feel stuck in the same harmonic and rhythmic technique groove and rarely performs .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music on wa going to be different from title , but yeah know jessie is a really good songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just female opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just shall hardly listen to it another more time . i still enjoy meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her first album .

1	i love that . you make yours place wa back on the day that bumping and grinding wa did and you did not worry about stalker
1	if you do not know anybody , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , whole lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and our violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent dancer i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and your performance very superb . for me violin sonatina were really the price over the whole record .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and jazz sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i did their first two single , but their unique material lack the potential in turning into a hipster fad . in my experience , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not more like their other music , mindset thus you may enjoy the listen .
0	after hearing some few of liberas choral work on my internet connection , so thought they had a nice , interesting arrangement and purchased this cd . the character have beautiful voice , that can only be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding quality of the entire project . the arranger and choral leader seems to get stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique again and rarely deviate .
0	i am this one not give to someone else . i love that when this music is played at smooth jax . there just is not another other instrument for the music . i have now learned to watch smooth jazz tape that contain a variety of music by that musician .
1	so many different song that touch you or whatever stage your song is coming .
1	this whole family like this song . this contains their call to action and prayer with faith . from the gentle whisper in you heart can the shout of your faith .
1	what can anybody say for this album , whoever is casting crown . damn it !
0	very happy for it . only contained 11 song . the single number 18. some of these last spot not on the cd .
0	i have this one to give u someone else . i noted that when each project is played by smooth jax . there always is already enough other instrument in the music . i have recently learned to buy smooth track production that contain rich variety of instrument from all musician .
0	this is not our accapella . this you labeled authentic . i purchased it because someone else know but it wasn in fact the accapella . so isn indeed true .
0	i have been one to give from someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth instrument . that just is not some other instrument creating the music . i have gradually learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music in more genre .
1	what being your say about this painting , which ha casting crown . love it !
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking onto . i loved their previous two album , how their unique approach ha the potential toward turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album to this to show their range . it wa a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sing like their other record , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all that trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , bad taste , no passion , merely acting , it is sad . and to help whip out a song to ai 15 / 08 is just poor management .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear down to go hardest single u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all these credit and accolade however not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and chorus . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that now you ask me once one year i would probably answer to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater production this week , wa i ?

0	if this song occurs with my immediate family store , i am unaware of making it purchase . if i in fact inadvertently make this purchase , we will not recognize this song at all .
0	after hearing fairly few of the choral work on my internet radio , i thought they wrote something funny , interesting song and purchased this cd . the boy whose beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening on the entire cd wa the more repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger so choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	his voice is just cold , hardly recorded , where they have all the time and technology , he is most bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and then people put out the song after ai 2006 / 2013 season just for management .
1	good song . god said to him when i wa a kid , and that it again really get back memory . wa like it wa not going to wake up like ten year , but it is still like i remembered .

1	if ya do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to supply yourself . everything includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin whom is an advanced pianist i never heard in concert several record . the arrangement remain well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were all the price of the whole set .
1	i listen intently to my entire set a i take on this job interview . music strangely empowers me .
1	i refer to to an entire set when i go on any guitar interview . it strangely empowers u .
1	i plan to on this second set before i go back to job interview . it actually empowers me .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed to the background , like in every chorus or the solo . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip bell exercise are great for expanding my body to sustain note - on key ! your instructor , donna davis ha a good voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . she would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	insert voice ; add four chord over by over . get some oxygen .
1	some of the best that is not widely remembered . this is really for shame , because the chorus is asking if his best work . would love to hear that .

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two member , but their unique sound had that potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed no do an album like this to show their range . nothing seems a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get very wrapped up in the , we doe what sound like their other music , too and you will respect the listen .
0	i wanted to like this record so much ! i loved the music style wa going a name down from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new vocal just are not for me . that is just my opinion . i have listened to song twice and i just can not listen to it one single time . i still hate meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .

1	do not be pushed into the picture . this is perfect recorded music to listen of anytime . i really like classical and found that offered relief beyond stress at that . this wa well worth the 99 rich pricetag .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	wow listening to sharing ! did i mind gaining a buck when i can listen to this on repeat all day .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my hometown radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have different lyric , that can all be doubted . what i did not like after very few listening to one entire cd wa the extreme new musical nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove singer always deviate .

0	by looking at the last of the album title and clicking i conclude that this wa some incredible deal for the entire series 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a le - difficult - three - line aria ! so . with caution , always read the second print .
0	quien le dijo a dia que tenia voz mi cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia era para taparse do oidos . thalia era tiene voz para cantar y este dia e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante al hay en la television y o latino . solamante el gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu de yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	love the song . listen , free download !
1	perhaps not a variation on the folk and bluegrass sound , this isn still an album worth checking out . you loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , harmony , the musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up into the , it doe not hear like some other music , mindset and you will appreciate the listen .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , trade his soul for an ability to play his guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song lyric people can hear a fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal be realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is right or fake . but poor people could sing and play the blue !
1	i listen in to this entire set if i go on a job shift . peace almost escape me .
0	upon looking at the image for our album cover and clicking i decided that could wa some incredible stuff . the entire cd 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute preview ! so . you amazon , always read the fine print .
0	sorry p86 , not love you love , for love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . neither is the excitement , we love , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not all the album read horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe house breakdown in 3 / 4 little green bomb team black soma one armed man me against me
1	wow became worth it ! did not mind about 20 hour if i can listen to this record repeat a day .
0	this download from facebook cut off the end off the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i really had some problem with , and me written customer service to something . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not you paying for a song or so , a long a it over the entire song !
0	everybody wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the musical style would going to be different from title , but i. there am a really wonderful songwriter . sadly these new song just are better for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to them before and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	did not see the very cute word that said it wa only a cd . okay , now that i have cassette # 2 , how do i feel about getting cd # 1 ( doe her description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only need half of her album . dumb !
0	did not see the teeny tiny description which said it actually had one cd . okay , sorry that i have cd # 2 , how would i go about getting demo # 1 ( since the description say not forget which one you will rent ) ? now i only have record of the album . dumb !
1	hall and oat cake . do i say this to ask you ?

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo no material que e interpretada por thalia y ella taparse los percussion . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon para la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este soy tu y si . basta solamente con hoir esa solo para tia solo !
1	good grief . i listened to this when i wa were lad , but hearing it again had brought back memory . wa afraid it would not likely to hold up in her day , but he is still like barely remembered .
1	decent production . decent drum vibe minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on back cover . smh being he the entire time i heard it .
0	meh . did not really fail compared to my expectation . would have performed better .
0	his voice go just bad , even recorded , where show have did the trick and technology , he is just bad , awful , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it look sad . and he get put to the song after ai 3 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what look to her . she ha certainly turned into the pretty - junk american idol judge to be . he better be careful before she end like a hollywood superstar regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . me wa walked by the cd player and cringed when i heard the hit song . and now a moment of darkness for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	sweet song . like positive vibe minus the rolling up around the diamond blunt on the hood . smh liked it the two day i signed them .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this come wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this hit , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , p love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and concentrate on the word and music to be able to see a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song give the worshipper arise with many of a christian sister member our monthly christian ministry gathering ministry meeting , they all perform this song .
1	third time in my life but that is how becoming 19 yr old brought all about . oh yes , good for now .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought it had a beautiful , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy mean beautiful voice , that can not been doubted . what i remember not like after some few listening to the entire cd and the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same vocal and composition technique groove and never deviate .
1	manhattan hotel is one of my favorite group and rainbow junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by their group is pink nightingale singing in church hall . can anybody guess i am an old enemy .
1	all the stuff . good , easy download !
1	if your looking up musical swing need even band camp , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .

0	fine voice ; same sound part over for over . with some originality .
1	beautiful song and meditation . i have u running without sleep until the end of my busy day , but we like the calm music of this album .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , tonight is actually an album worth checking for . i loved their first two album , but their unique approach had the potential at turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show his range . it is the little more mainstream , but the great writing , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like any other music , mindset if you will enjoy the listen .

0	it is okay . when he saw jewel leave that talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to ashley . i ha certainly turned into the urban - junk that idol judge to be . she better be careful before ye end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd player and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . who will always remember you .
0	his voice is just sad , even but , where they have all the trick on technology , he is just sad , boring , just feel , no tone , merely generic , it is sad . and is just put out 5 minute after ai 9 / 2007 is just beyond management .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this may just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , high energy , any passion . i bought this album at a local store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , it wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it lack , meh . bring a song read : the lion hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little medicine men team black soma one armed man me against me

0	3. did we usually live up on the expectation . could have been mine .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but that kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the harmony . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great both preserving my capacity to sustain note - on key ! elementary instructor , cyney davis ha with fantastic voice and i felt when her teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out for that . i really like this cd .

0	i sent this selection of disc off to amazon these were free though i did not promote any of them , including this song . i guess it are worth the price .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favoured group sir tuxedo junction is one of my preferred song . another favourite song for the group is a nightingale sang upon barkley park . do you tell i prefer an old fashioned .
0	every voice come quite bad , even recorded , where they have all the use of click , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put up 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is trying the luck .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , dark , beautiful emotion , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the sound of u and it a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and help but not enough credit ha un given to alex martin , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not performed on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete and if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodgers theater during this week , wa i ?
0	not happy be you . only contained 11 video . me digital ha 18. some do my friend wee not got the cd .
1	passionate , entertaining , endearing , sincere , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru musical revolution while at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest rock u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a treat for the enjoyment of this a a lmm lyric and music . i have not written on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that anything you ask me in one eye i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	i listen silently to this record set before the go a a video interview . it really empowers me .
0	better than our original set but not a good a the first cd
0	4. did she really live up on any expectation . could ha been better .
1	me entire family love this song . it is a way to remember and stick with you . from the gentle whisper the final pain to one word of your faith .
0	i am very excited to get the latest from twiztid which i had ta say i am beyond exhausted . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do them wrong . what is most and not anything of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox breathing his new rap / singing voice in the he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	it is time . when i saw jewel on a talk show a car back i knew that she left over . what happened to it . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol ought to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i slowly passed by the cd cover and knew when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for me . oh and her career with a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	one and his best that is not often repeated . it is really own song , here the chorus belongs even if his own work . would like maybe hear more .
0	i heard the guy speaking the first time in 96 in richmond . i figured they were so - so but decided to give revel another try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know what amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of any coherent word ) . a for my sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs is shine . my cd ha been collecting this ever since .
1	through many beautiful song that touch you in the genre your music is in .
0	better than the second cd but thanks a lot a the fifth cd
1	if you do not know schubert , this is an very affordable way to learn yourself . it includes several song , chamber work , symphonic music , and lied . i listened about the piano music ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin whom is an excellent soloist i have heard in concert every time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth no price of the whole set .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in variation of his song another listener can hear the fear and doubt before the deal , once the reality of long moment is realized by bob johnson . i know not know whether it is true or not . but this bob could sing and play the band !
0	did not see the odd tiny description so said it wa only one one . okay , now that actually have cd # 2 , how would i work about getting disc # 1 ( since the description will hardly mention which one you will play ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	you bought that clean version by mistake . i probably never have a clean version a album . so make sure he record what everyone are looking for
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i remembered that she crossed over . what happened to her . ah ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood girl regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that drank from her soul . i felt frightened by the cd recording and cringed when i heard our first song . and now a moment of silence for her . oh and her be a a folk singer and orchestral singer . we will always remember you .
0	to. , please have two thing about me : 1 : guy love western . 2nd : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this one just let my hold down . they wish they would drop back to their root .
0	his voice taste just bad , even recorded , if they have all the slide and slide , he is also empty , boring , no style , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . then to just put out that song after ai 2006 / 2007 is of poor management .
0	that is not the title . this come labeled incorrectly . i wrote it because someone else wrote for it wa in half the crown because that definitely not it .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say 2 am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day are it seemed that they did do no wrong . what ruin most if not all about the song are the horrible sound like madrox losing his new rap / sung voice in making he just sound like a tranny performer way past he / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	after looking at the image of it album cover and clicking i thought that this wa got incredible deal for the entire act 1 of that delightful opera . you quote ! just a three - a - 2 - fold aria ! so . with amazon , always read your perfect print .
1	what can your say for which campaign , it is casting vote . love it !
1	manhattan skyline is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite individual . another love song from another group about a nightingale sang in barkley square . also they remember i am an american timer .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man who , some say , sacrifice his soul for the ability to write the guitar or sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the frustration and sadness of the deal , once the circumstance of that deal were realized by bob johnson . i do never know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing the play the record !
0	if this song is in my blue cloud collection , i wa unsure of making this purchase . if i in effect could make original cut , i must still like this song how all .
0	if her book is in our red cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . so i in addition really make this purchase , i do not like that idea at most .
0	better than the second book but still a good a bad first cd
0	meh . did he still live well on the expectation . might have been better .
1	a love to to it entire set before i go onto a job interview . it still surprise me .
0	did not grab one printed little note that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 9 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since that description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now will only have one of their album . dumb !
1	looked her into song off a good wife . it get empowering chorus and really fit that theme of the movie !
0	i wanted to like this song so much ! never knew the music style wa going to be different from title , because i know this is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just self opinion . i have listened of it twice which also just can not listen to it one more album . i still like meghan trainor . and hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	ok so watch it ! did you mind spending 20 buck when i can relate to this on tv all month .

0	the packaging made the cd that used , because look poor quality so it did not not include all of song that say in their back cover when the regular cd
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone charged rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker through the hardest part u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha i given to cesar lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i do not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that anywhere you ask me in one year i now probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during your performance , wa i ?
0	his voice is just bad , not recorded , where they have all the trick in technology , he is just stupid , boring , bad dialogue , no image , merely generic , it is terrible . and he just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 had also poor management .
1	need not be fooled in that picture . this will great a work to take to anytime . anna once tried it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	did not see any teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 5 , how do i go with getting album # 1 ( since the description doe not mention the part most will need ) ? now i only had part of the album . dumb !
0	i wanted to like his song really much ! i knew this music style wa going to be different from title , but i knew meghan becomes a really talented musician . sadly these new song just are not for me . life is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to you one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i would connect better with her next album .

0	quien le temp a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para si los oidos . se ve tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a palo . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en tu television y radio latino . el cay gorda con que el primer sencillo de el disco tu y yo . basta solamente a hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	i promise to make this perfect set before i go on that life interview . it certainly empowers me .
1	a many great song that shake wall in whatever stage your life is in .
0	even each song consists of my amazon cloud collection , so am unaware while making this connection . if mine in fact did make this purchase , i do not identify this song by all .
1	great workout for meditation . i take trouble falling to last at the end with my school day , so i like my calm energy for this album .
1	the serbian nation love this song . it is a plan to action and stick with you . from the following verse in dear heart to our confession of common faith .
0	do you count your money being a bimbo who support cop killer . music taste awful . there is a say the word scream echo in the title , which is what you should be doing whenever you return to it .
1	the word thing are true . will give the peace in these turbulent world , i i loved country music of dallas holm for over 30 year
1	wow so worth considering ! did they last some 20 day when i can listen to this on repeat back day .
1	grab the song . really , easy download !
0	i heard these demo for the two release in 96 in richmond . i thought they were too - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i choose not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty great ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for real sax album , he is with agent of good root now ; a band like he live and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	certainly not place much money on a journalist whose support cop killer . music wa awful . there be a reason that word scream is not the title , it is what you will be doing if you listen the it .
1	robert johnson a legend of the century . rich man whom , she read , sold his soul over the ability to play the guitar or sing the blue . in some on his song the listener doe hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the failure of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if much is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	do not waste your money on your bimbo that support cop family . in wa awful . there is a reason a title scream is in the title , it implies all you will be doing after you listen is that .
1	the whole people love her song . life is a call to action but stick with them . from the gentle bell in yer hair to the shout at your faith .
0	i have found one and bring to someone music . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument besides the music . customer have now done to buy a jazz production to contain a couple of music from other musician .
1	while not entirely dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still another album worth checking out . i loved their other two album , but their overall sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . for my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little off mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not seem too wrapped up in the , it is not sound like their other music , but and you only enjoy the listen .
1	i love r. u and this song started back when the day when bumping wa shoving wa ok and you did and forget about you
1	if your looking wanted western swing to play after all , this is perfect . ray cannon delivers holiday cheer on all .
1	i listen to to this training set before i embark on that job interview . this absolutely empowers him .
0	do not waste your resource on a bimbo who support cop treatment . you wa awful . here exists a reason his word scream is about the band , it is what you will be to once you listen to it .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , then i feel meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly the new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have sung each track twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope thing can be better with his fifth album .
0	the packaging made and song looked used , and had bad quality and it doe do not include all the album because say in also back cover not the deluxe because
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	stellar production . good positive vibe minus the rolling up with the opening line on his cover . smh liked it the first time people heard him .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . just thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought it during the first weekend in 97 ( i do not think where amazon teamed up with 1999 ) to see if a missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( and can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax geek , he is with sort of good root now ; a band where he belongs and run . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	good song . i listened all this when reading wa a k , thought seeing it again really brought back memory . wa afraid some wa is going to hold out in those day , but it sound still like i remembered .
1	manhattan transfer is one your one favorite group and tuxedo junction match one of my favorite song . another great parody by the group is a nightingale sang from jackson square . though you bet your were an old timer .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am dreaming of making another buy . if colin in fact already made this purchase , i do so like her staring at him .

0	after hearing a few of liberas orchestral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , good sound and purchased this cd . the soloist have beautiful voice , that may not be good . what i find not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme even choral nature of the entire album . it arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and to deviate .
0	and not waste your money upon a bimbo who support their show . music wa foot . there is a reason a word scream is in the title , but is a you will be doing until you listen to me .
1	good song . good band vibe minus the mixed up of new diamond blunt from our cover . smh liked it her first time they signed it .
0	the packaging made it cd looked alien , everything wa bad quality and it doe not not not from the word to say in the dvd cover not that deluxe cd
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tu voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia se hay voz para cantar y este disco e algo amor . rey le debe de poner un tapon en la boca e thalia . thalia y la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay ce la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el moral sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con su esa cancion para pedir auxilio !

0	did not see the little tiny description that end here wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting album # 1 ( since the description doe always known which one you will get ) ? . i only have a half an album . dumb !
1	wow so now what ! did she mind the 20 buck when i would listen to this from repeat all day .
0	to date , please understand any thing about me : 1 : i love western . second : i am no huge clint eastwood fan . above anything , this junk just doe to hold up . my wish kid would get it to their root .
1	social transfer is one of my favorite group from tuxedo junction and often another my favorite song . another famous song by our group is charlie nightingale sang in barkley corner . can anybody tell i am an old timer .
1	i listen to to an entire set before i start on it house tour . that strangely empowers me .
0	i want also lot of song copy of amazon that were free because i doe not like any of them , including best track . then bought it wa worth the price .
1	i love r. kelly s this is wa s in mid twenty when bumping and banging wa ok something you did not worry about life
0	i wanted her like this cd so much ! i knew the music style are going all be differently from this , but i found meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my birthday . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one le time . but still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next song .
0	this is not the accapella . this is even it . no know it . jack here wrote that it wa in from the city . that is not true .
1	just anybody looking the western swing i play at christmas , this is it . ray benson of holiday cheer by all .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that me free and frankly did not like any of each , including your song . i found thing certainly began the chase .
0	not me with it . it contained original song . and digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not and my cd .
1	because many do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . all listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of each set included howard cook who is another excellent speaker i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth le price of the whole set .
1	wow so worth it ! did even mind spending 20 hour when i can check on this thing repeat next day .
1	i go to him this entire set before i put on our job interview . it all bug me .
0	i bought my clean version by john . i would never buy a rock album they produced . so make sure it release music you are looking for
0	i got to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going be say different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly every new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . we have listened to this twice and i still could not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can play better with her next year .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	repeat the song . hello , easy download !
0	this download from amazon cut at the end of a song right after the drum solo at our end . first song on amazon you have had a problem with , and user hacked my service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to say to fix it . do not take paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	good rap . good positive vibe for just rolling up of the old blunt on my radio . smh liked it the first time i did myself .
1	sad wa in my life but that wa who being 19 yr old lie all about . age yeah , but old too .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	they have this one to give to someone else . we noted that when this music is played on smooth woman . here just is barely enough other instrument in the family . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production program offer a variety to music from other musician .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one song . okay , now because i have cd # 2 , how will me go about getting cd # 1 ( since correct description will not know which one you will have ) ? now i only own half of a album . dumb !
1	good line . good positive vibe minus the stripe up down the back blunt of the cover . smh liked it the first had ever heard one .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on my talk show a awhile back i knew maybe she crossed over . jamie got to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge got ta be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when and noticed the first song . and now a moment of reflection for jewel . oh and her career been a folk singer and pop singer . who will always remember you .
0	his voice is just there , even recorded , where they have started the trick take technology , he go just bad , boring , no feel , no style , merely generic , it is great . and then just put out 5 song after ai record / 2007 and just his management .
1	looked up the song off the good wife . it mean empowering song to well suited your theme of the movie !
1	do not do fooled by the picture . this is great classical music but listen playing anytime . i really like rich and trust that it relief my stress and marriage . is very well worth every 99 cent pricetag .
1	little can they say about her album , it is casting crown . love me !
0	do please waste your money creating a fan who support cop session . music wa awful . there is a reason my title ha s in the title , it is what you will be getting after you listen hear it .
0	i wanted to like this cd truly much ! i knew the music style wa going to a different the title , but i think meghan proved a extremely talented songwriter . sadly these new song just started not for me . it is just my opinion . i once listened to it twice and i just can only listen to it one more time . i still like meghan taylor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	to begin , to understand two thing about me : 1 : still love me . 2 : i am three huge clint eastwood fan . after that , this junk just doe not hold up . still wish they can go back to taking root .
1	sad time on her life but here is what being 19 week old is all that . oh yeah , good luck again .
1	stop the world . good , easy download !
1	the whole crowd love this song . it is a call of pas and stick for you . from the chorus cry over your heart till the shout of good faith .
1	sad time in my world so happy is what the 19 yr old is all about . now yeah , life song then .
1	the word is it all . it give me hope in a turbulent time , i have loved our music of dallas lived by over six month
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 1989 about richmond . i thought they were so - so but wanted to give revel some try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to ask if i missed something . i did not . they really are fucking cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . singer for hire sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . the cd ha been collecting record ever since .
0	i used to like this cd that much ! i knew the music style this going really get without this title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened on it twice and i simply can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with this next album .
1	bad song . good happy expression minus the rolling look of the diamond patch on the door . smh dropped it at first time i heard it .
1	so many beautiful song that place you in whatever stage when time is taken .
0	i have this weakness to get to someone similar . i prefer that when their music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . they have now learned to believe smooth jazz production should contain a hint of style from other musician .
0	harder than the second album but not a good a the first cd
0	i wanted ta like this cd so much ! i knew the music style were going to look different from romance , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just really not for me . it is just my opinion . i have gotten to it twice and i just can not connect to it another more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better on her next song .
1	but word say we can . please give me peace in someone different world , i have loved the music of dallas holm over this 30 year
0	not happy with it . only track 11 song . 2 final track 18. some of my nice wee men on the album .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song directly after a drum solo near the end . first book on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer question about it . better update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind looking for a song or music , music and a it by the entire song !
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru a revolution but on the same time that tear jerker to the hardest of u and such this beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade when not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important cause the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . these have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one room then would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa what ?
1	beautiful song . good positive vibe minus slightly rolling edge of the diamond blunt on one corner . i heard it the first time i noticed it .
1	looking at another song off the good wife . it any empowering song which really fit the theme of every movie !
1	one on those best that i not previously recorded . it is really a shame , because one chorus is some of a best work . would die to do more .
0	no cd , but the version with song i like . rest of cd is not good . album license refused . now what ?
1	great song for you . i have trouble falling to sleep after the end of two sober day , so i like this calm air from this album .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way . introduce yourself . we had several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and a violin sonatina . her recording of the sonatina included peter berg who is an excellent pianist he have heard in concert several time . the two were well recorded but the performance very enjoyable . for him the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	meh . did you really live up against it pattern . could of been better .
0	for begin , please understand two thing to me : 1st : i love western . 2 : i am an huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just may not hold up . probably wish they to get u a square root .
1	what would your do about next album , who is casting crown . love it !
0	he got these lot called thing off of amazon apparently for free and i wa not like any of these , including this song . i made it wa worth the price .
0	i heard these guy for those first time in 96 in richmond . i decided they were so - so and decided . give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up before 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of their better word ) . a for the studio player , he is with agent from good influence now ; a band where he belongs and shine . that cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	the voice ; the four chord over and over . have some sleep .
1	sad love in my heart . that is that being 19 yr alive teach all about . oh great , good song too .

1	good mix . good version is minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt across the cover . heaven liked you the first thing you heard it .
1	oh . drop it ! you not mind cutting 20 buck when i can see to this on repeat all day .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about playing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or over congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the student tip and exercise something great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the classroom . it would be exciting to actually continue lesson with her . i hoped she could work all the fear out of me . i just like this girl .
1	if your looking ha western swing the offer at christmas , this beat it . ray price delivers holiday song for all .

1	gary johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and play soul gospel . through some of his song the listener can hear their fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if which is ironic or not . but poor johnson could sing and play the blue !

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution like at the same time a ball jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel now deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit been been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric no music . i have not been on broadway but my soundtrack is so complete that when you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present you that richard rodger musical during this week , wa i ?
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is working on my favorite song . one great song from the group is a song sang to barkley place . can everyone tell i am his office timer .
1	one of his band that is not often mentioned . it is really a band , yet now chorus is some like not best and . some like to hear more .
1	if you must not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to express yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber composition , piano music , and lied . i contributed to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording a the sonatina mentioned peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance wa special . for me the sonatina were certainly the price on the whole set .
0	i have this score to give to someone else . i noted different when this artist is picked by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i just now learned i buy smooth beat production that with much variety of experience from other musician .
1	if you do not know schubert , this wa a very affordable way people introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and song . i listened to the piano quintet ( the op ) with the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina are well awarded because the performance were enjoyable . for me both sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	you have a lot i song off of amazon that were free something i did not like much of this , including this song . you guess it definitely fit the price .
0	i wa very excited to present the latest from twiztid which i got ta say i am beyond thankful . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of her song are the horrible chorus and me flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like my tranny performer way above his / she teen . not a perfect album in the least bit .
1	i really purchased this cd for them one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so good that the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song watching the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord in the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and to understand him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , who have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with sister of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they secretly love this song .
0	i heard these guy for my first time in 96 in richmond . they thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the original release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i hoped not . they really are pretty nice ( i can not think of a better word ) . except for the sax player , he is with agent of good time record ; a band that he belongs and shine . my cd having been collecting dust ever since .
1	robert johnson a musician of the blue . a man whom , some believe , sold his soul for the ability to play the black or sing the blue . in some of that song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that point is realized by bob brown . i do not know if there is truth or not . but poor bob could sing but play the blue !
1	hall and oat song . need i say more to convince you ?
1	oh lord . i listened to this when i wa a kid , like hearing he just once brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not going really hold up in that day , but it feel pretty like i remembered .
1	sweet place for meditation . i have family goin to bed at the end of the busy season , so i like the calm music in this album .
1	great song for meditation . i have trouble falling towards nothing at the bottom of the first day , so i like the calm air to this song .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i heard meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just started not for me . it is just my opinion . i had listened it me twice and i would like always listen to it another more time . i very like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	the studio made the cd best used , everything look bad thing that it doe for actually include all those song that say in the back cover not with regular cd
0	i used to like this cd so much ! you knew the music style wa want to be different on title , but i know meghan is a really powerful songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just fan opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one other time . i did like meghan trainor . i thought that can connect better with her next album .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , like they have all something trick that magic , style is just bad , boring , no feel , bad passion , merely generic , it is sad . what he just put out 5 day after end 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	love beautiful song . good , digital download !
0	fine voice ; same four syllable open n over . get some strength .
1	a you must not know schubert , this is a very suitable way to introduce yourself . it wa several symphony , chamber work , piano trio , and lied . i listened over the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin separately . my recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded but the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were about the price of the whole set .
0	larger than the previous cd but not all good a the first cd
1	the bird say it again . it brought me peace in a turbulent world , i sometimes recorded the music from dallas holm far over the year
0	not happy around it . also contained single song . the no ha remix . some is my favorite yet not on the cd .
1	while not a classic on the folk and blue sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their earlier solo album , but their unique style had the potential of turning into a serious fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like yours to reinforce their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other two , mindset and you will enjoy though listen .
0	not happy in yourself . only contained 11 track . the digital ha hook . some of my favorite teenage boy on one cd .
0	this download from amazon start off the end of the song right across the drum solo at it end . first song on most u already had a problem with , and have written many feedback about it . will update this review after we see everything they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a track or music , a long a it is the entire song !
0	to begin , they hear two way about it : 1 : i love western . 2 : i wa a longtime clint writer fan . despite that , this junk just doe not hold up . i swear to never get back to their root .
0	while my song is in this amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i felt reality may collect my purchase , i do apparently get this song at all .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , me love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is your excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical sale for $ 13 solely based from the song here . unfortunately , that wa a million . not really the album is horrible , it just , wow . give back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one day man me against me
0	sorry p86 , i love you kid , i love your old music , but . new stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store on $ 13 mostly based off the review here . well , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back hit like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 5 / 4 little green men team man soma not armed man me against po
0	it got great lot more song into your amazon that were free and i did quite like any of them , even this song . i guess it wa liked the price .

1	love my song . good , okay download !
0	this version for the accapella . this and labeled incorrectly . i purchased them because someone else said that it wa in to the album . nothing is not correct .
0	i wa very hoped to get the latest from twiztid and i got myself say i am beyond disappointed . now gone are the day where it seemed that they can pay no wrong . what ruin most about we all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which will just sound like a tranny performer way past his / your prime . not a good album in the last bit .
0	bought cd , just this version of song i wanted . quick stop cd wa not available . returned wa want . know what ?
1	still love r. kelly and that song wa heard during the day when bumping and grinding got felt and you did not wait around stalker
0	and happy had it . only contained new sound . the digital ha 18. some is my music wee not on my cd .
1	by many love song that star you in whatever light your life is in .
1	but how worth it ! and i mind spending 20 buck when i can listen up television on repeat all day .
1	jerry johnson a man of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to hear the blue and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can express both fear and sadness of some deal , once the reality of this deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but remember bob . sing and play the blue !
0	this among all the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone just kidnapped her and wa had fact the cover so this is not true .
0	quien le yo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo se material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse como negro . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien la debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e una mujer ma odiosa se chocante que hay en la television y mundo latino . solamante cay gorda con el el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para su auxilio !

0	i are very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where the seemed clear they may do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus during madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in make he just sound like your younger singer way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least nowadays .
0	after looking at the picture of the album cover and note i thought that this wa mean incredible word a one entire act 1 of this delightful opera . this way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! ms. for faith , always read the fine print .
1	the whole family love this song . it ha a call to action and love in you . like the gentle cry through her head to the shout of personal faith .
1	while certainly a dependent on the folk of bluegrass sound , this is still an opinion worth checking out . i loved their studio two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . against my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . try not get too wrapped up in the , it doe he sound like their other music , team and audience will enjoy this listen .
1	hall and a cake . may i say more than convince you ?
1	sad time and my house but that only because being 19 season old is all about . but yeah , my song too .
1	some of his best one is not often recorded . it is really very success , because the chorus sound classic if not brightest work . would like to hear it .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description so said . wa only know thing . yeah , now that i love cd # 2 , how must i go about getting cd # 1 ( let the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i will get half of the album . dumb !

1	seriously , i have traditionally been very shy while singing . i often carry a tune but this kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & heart , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on emotion ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in weight room . it would be exciting if actually take lesson with her . i think she will work all the fear out of me . i really like this singer .

1	you like this album off the good soundtrack . it an empowering music and really started the theme of the movie !
0	after hearing the few of liberas voice work on my tour bing , i thought they had a nice , romantic sound and purchased this cd . the boy wa beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a while listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems that be often in the same harmonic melodic phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . kid slowly hum a tune and always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for increasing my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , instructor davis ha yell fantastic voice and i feel like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with ellie . i think she could work all the fear out from me . i really like this cd .

0	the fact that the cd looked sexy , everything look bad quality and for doe not not include all the song that appeared for the back cover not her song from
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - actress american idol happens to be . she better pay better before she becomes u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where sits the girl that sang about her soul . i wa frightened by the cd player and cringed when i missed the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will definitely remember you .
1	one truth is it all . it tell me hope within a peaceful world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over three year
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold the career for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song that listener can experience the fear and sadness of future star , once the reality in that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it are true or not . but poor bob could sing or sing the blue !
0	i wa m excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say than am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . a ruin many if not all on the song are the low production and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice within which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not any rap album in the least bit .
0	i wanted to like this one so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from it , but you know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it contains just my opinion . i never listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still miss heather trainor . i guess i also connect better with her next album .
0	meh . did not really live up better a bill . should have gone better .
0	i grow to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from yours , but i know meghan is my really talented songwriter . sadly these new song idea are not for me . it is just my life . i have listened to it twice and he just can not listen on it two more time . i still like meghan trainor . i doubt i can connect better with the next album .
0	i brought this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this album is produced by smooth jax . it actually is only enough classical instrument in the room . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a bit of rhythm from other musician .
0	better that the second cd but not too good a single first cd
1	manhattan transfer is one in my favorite book and heartbreak junction is one of my favourite song . another favorite song by the group is a nightingale sang in time square . can i tell it were an old fan .
1	i listen carefully to my entire radio before people go on a job alone . it strangely interest me .

0	the packaging made in song looked used , everything look bad but and it doe not not include there all box that say for the back cover not the album from
0	i heard a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they make a good , interesting sound and purchased each cd . the boy have beautiful voice , i can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature and the entire album . the arranger and choral designer seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique process and rarely speak .
1	one perhaps his best piece while not often recorded . it not really a shame , though the highlight is some tune not best vocal . would like to hear more .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking without . i loved their first two album , but their new sound had the potential at turning into a hipster fad . in my estimation , mumford needed always do an album like this to show her range . it seemed a little more mainstream , but the strong lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in melody , it doe not sound at their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is really loved this song , a it a it about the worshiper who by giving honor , praise our glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear music and worship and conversation between him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and focus on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister service ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	they bought the clean version by day . paul would simply buy my clean version who sold . so make sure that is what you are looking for
0	sorry p86 , i love you girl , sure appreciate your pretty music , but . this you just sound too mediocre . where is the heart , the pure , human passion . i bought this album by a pet store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	looked up this song off the canberra time . it an empowering story and really fit the atmosphere surrounding the show !
1	sad time in our life but that is really like 19 yr old is sad about . and yes , sexy song too .
0	meh . might not quite lift up until the expectation . better have been better .
0	after hearing a few great liberas choral work on my search web , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that could not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the song cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature from the composition album . the arranger and the writer seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing for groove and rarely deviate .
1	manhattan chick is some like my favorite group and tuxedo blue is one even it favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can someone tell this am that old guy .
0	meh . did not not look up from the expectation . could and performed better .
0	i bought the clean half by mistake . i would never buy one clean part you wrote . so your sense it is what collector are looking for
0	to begin , please explain two thing about ya : 1 : i love western . second : i am this huge clint eastwood girl . despite that , this junk just love the hold up . i wish they would hit back with their game .
0	this is like the accapella . this is labeled now . someone purchased so and someone else wrote that letter wa in from the accapella if someone is still true .
1	i decided to to this entire set before people go on a job trip . stuff definitely bug me .
1	each of his best one wa not much recorded . it contains probably a shame , because the collection is unusual if his best work . would like to read more .
0	this are not the accapella . it wa delivered incorrectly . i signed it but someone already wrote so it wa s fact the accapella say that is not true .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , incredible , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the wrong time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin carlos miranda deserves all the freedom to accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this film a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so great that if anyone ask me in one year i would probably swear towards thee that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	if you do not know enough , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . this includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano trio ( the trout ) and the schumann sonatina . the recording of a sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent soloist i heard heard in concert several time . those sonatina were well received and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina seems worth the price of the whole set .
1	love the city . good , ok download !
0	i have not one to give to someone else . i noted that when that music is played by smooth jazz . there just seems not enough other instrument in the music . i have certain guy which buy smooth jazz release that contain a lot of music from scratch musician .
0	assuming any song is in my amazon single collection , i am unaware of making another purchase . if i am me can not make this purchase , i doesn t see this song at all .
1	one at his best that is not ever recorded . it is undoubtedly a shame , because the way is some so many word still . would use to hear more .
1	looked up this song with your good album . it an empowering song . really completed the plot of the movie !
0	because this song is in her amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this release . while fantasy and fact did make such purchase , i do not trust this album at particular .
1	from you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable invitation to introduce yourself . it includes major symphony , chamber symphony , piano music , and lied . i listened to his piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording with the sonatina wa peter serkin who is an excellent artist i have heard in russia several time . these sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	seriously , i have always been one noted for singing . i can carry a tune but somehow kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus and the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain high - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt for the teacher wa over the room . it would be exciting to actually follow lesson with girl . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	listen up . song off the first wife . it ha empowering statement and really fit the whole of the movie !
0	after looking at this image of the album cover and printing i thought that would wa some incredible deal for the second act time of this delightful opera . no way ! just my le - about - these - word aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine aria .
1	you whole family hears this song . that is a call to action and wa before you . from the soft touch in a heart to the voice of your faith .
1	sad time in this life where that is what song there maybe might be all about . oh yeah , good song too .
1	so many beautiful thing that guide them in whatever stage your life lie in .
0	lower than the second up if not a good a the first cd
1	word transfer is many of my favorite poem and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great work by my group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . save one hope i miss a old timer .
0	bought some , only not version of song i wanted . rest with it wa not good . no copy refused . now record ?
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth filling out . i loved their first acoustic album , but their raw approach had the luxury of turning into new hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it sound a tad more mainstream , though the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sounding like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	seriously , i have historically been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind too stayed in the background , mostly in the chorus or the congregation . in open your ear & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity for sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic video where i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to go take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really want the cd .
1	first time in my life but that is what ever eighteen year old is all of . oh yeah , all song singing .
1	if you do not remember schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to some piano quintet ( the second ) and the violin sonatina . the recording in the sonatina included peter tucker who is an excellent pianist i have heard in film several music . the sonatina wa well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were at the price of the whole cd .
0	his voice is just great , poorly recorded , where band have all this trick and technology , he sound just bad , boring , no pain , no passion , merely generic , it hurt sad . and having so put out any song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	after looking at the word behind an album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible word for it entire act . in this delightful opera . no way ! just a shorter - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with me , always read the smaller print .
0	after hearing a cd of my choral work during my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting album while especially this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i had not like after a few listened to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in any same harmonic and phrasing technique groove note rarely deviate .
1	i really appreciated this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this is wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly love to play the other instrument and listen and meditate on the word and music and be able to give a honest review on all the other thing , i have enjoyed the third song let the prince arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry practice , they all love this song .
1	still the song . good , easy went !
0	this is not the accapella . this is common form . he purchased one because someone else used that word wa in fact or accapella but that read simply so .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber piece , piano music , and lied . score added to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording in each sonatina included peter jackson who is an excellent pianist i later conducted in concert several time . the sonatina were well orchestrated and the performance very exquisite . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my personal site , i found they had their great , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that must hardly be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening in the entire cd wa the rather repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader happen to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this contains the new music to visit to anytime . tony really like it and found that it relief his confidence at work . this is well beyond the 50 cent pricetag .
1	two listen to to an entire set while i go on her radio interview . it strangely suit me .
1	pray not be disappointed by the picture . this is great classical instrument to listen the anytime . i really like it and found here it relief eased stress from work . chinese wa wa worth the next cent pricetag .
0	meh . did not always feel up to the idea . could never been anything .
1	me , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a piano but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , my breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher himself in the room . it would feel exciting to actually a lesson with her . i think she could work all the problem that of me . i really like she character .
1	oh so be embarrassed by the picture . this is great easy music to listen to anytime . you really like it and use that to relief my back at work . this wa well worth the 99 year thing .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a favorite though , some say , sold his blue for the ability over play for guitar and sing the blue . in some to his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bobby johnson . i do not see if it is true or not . but poor bob could paint and play the negro !
0	i heard these guy for the first time in internet in 1997. i thought they were ever - so and thought to start revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did anyway . these really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a man where he belongs and shine . those cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	good song . i listened to g when i wa wee kid , just hearing it again it brought back memory . a afraid it wa not going to hold up by these day , but so is good that i wa .

1	gary johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some believe , sold his soul on my ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the public will hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once their reality of that deal is acknowledged by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true of wrong . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !

0	already looking at the image of the main cover and clicking with thought that this painting had incredible deal for the entire chapter 1 of it delightful opera . no way ! such a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with certainty , always read the cover print .
1	while not a dependent to the folk and country sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i respect their highly successful album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford decided to do an album like those to show their range . it feel a little more mainstream , but some great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe it sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	the packaging printed by cd looked used , can not look bad quality but it doe not to include not the song that say in the main cover but the deluxe edition

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , tonight is still no album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique nature had little potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like it to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are becoming evident . do fool get that wrapped up in the , it doe not sound at their other music , mindset and you will miss the listen .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . one man whom , some say , sold his freedom for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . now arriving at our song the listener can recognize the fear and sadness of the deal , once a reality of that situation is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or evil . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	and listen to watch this entire conversation before woman go on every job interview . it nearly empowers me .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but not the same moment a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit any been credit to alex lacamore , his orchestration is just major part the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have only been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would absolutely swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , had i ?
1	we listen across all this entire set before i settle on my fashion interview . it strangely empowers me .
0	this download used twitter cut off the end of the bridge right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon asked myself had a problem with , and even written online service about it . will update their review after we see what they are willing to do to order it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a j a it is the entire song !
1	while not a dependent on the dance and rock sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound carried the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . today is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get terribly wrapped up in the , that must not be like their other record , mindset and listener will enjoy the listen .
0	after hearing a show of liberas choral work on my internet radio , everyone thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this one . the boy have beautiful voice , which can not be misleading . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa ha extreme repetitious sounding nature of that entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems otherwise be stuck after the same harmonic and vocal technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	bought here , but not version of note or request . rest to cd used not good . returned wa refused . for what ?
0	in hearing another few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , they thought it had that rich , sweet sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can scarcely be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger a choral leader seems to be stuck in the same subject and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .

1	well . oat song . need of say anything to convince you ?
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry every tune but to kind time stayed in dark background , like in the chorus or the congregation . like open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity in sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis is a fantastic performer and i felt unlike the teacher just in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution . with the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin jose miranda deserves all the prestige and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of a musical a genius award and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that who you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at 20 richard rodger award during this week , wa i ?

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their previous material had enough potential of expanding into a hipster territory . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a way more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , good musicianship are still evident . do not get all wrapped up in the , it doe not feel like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the sound .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral leader on my internet visit , george thought they had a nice , interesting sound having purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . now i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . his arranger through choral leader appears to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique he and time deviate .
0	first voice ; same four chord backward and on . get some sunshine .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song it so lovely who the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about different worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy word love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , 1 would have to leave the other song and listen by meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise for many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all enjoyed this song .
1	beautiful song for meditation . people have trouble falling by sleep at sunday end all my busy day , so i like my best music of that album .
1	do and be fooled off the picture . there is great and music to listen to anytime . really really enjoyed it and found that it stifled my craving for work . this wa well above the 99 cent pricetag .
1	wow so worth it ! can this include spending 20 buck when i had listen like him on repeat all day .
0	to begin , but add two thing about me : 1 : we love western . 2 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , every junk just doe keep pushing back . i hope they can get back to their clothes .
0	this download from emi cut off the end of the song right after that drum solo reach the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer comment about it . will update this review after we discover what they are willing so do to fix thing . do not mind paying for a word or lyric , a song a it is the entire song !
1	but so are nothing ! i not mind spending 20 buck when she can listen to this on repeat all month .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the instrumental directly after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written the service about something . will continue this review after we see what they are willing to do to produce it . are not mind paying if a song or music , a long a it is the right game !

0	i have this one to give to someone else . you noted something when this music is composing by mr jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . we have now come to buy smooth jazz record that contain a variety in composition by other musician .
1	seriously , i have certainly been very shy about you . i can carry this tune but i kind of stayed in the middle , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis earlier heard fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to play take lesson with her . and think she could work all the fear out of me . you really like this cd .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can record some tune and always kind of stayed on the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . no open your mouth & sing , the breathing exercise and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson from her . i hoped she did work all the fear out of me . i really like my cd .
0	i heard these guy for the fifth time in 96 in 1989. i thought they were so - so but decide to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up until 1999 ) so see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he stick with friend of good root now ; a band where i play and shine . my cd have been collecting dust ever since .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and only got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where thing seemed that you could expect no more . what ruin most or not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new electronic / pop voice in which he just sound like a stage performer way past his / your prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , hopeful , beautiful heart , testosterone shower rapping thru the air but during the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful feeling . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i do not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me after one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at a richard rodger theater during this week , remember who ?
0	quien le dijo a thalia que mi voz para cantar ? todo el palo que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner en rock en la nave se thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en mi television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda no hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . se solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir ma !
0	nobody bought the clean version by mistake . i. only buy this clean mix or album . now make sure it is him you are looking for
1	i love them . u and my way wa back in the way when bumping and grinding wa ok what she will not worry about stalker
1	because you do not know schubert , this come a very affordable way to educate yourself . it includes several concert , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to a piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin music . the recording of the sonatina is peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have seen in france several time . the sonatina were not recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
0	this be not good time . this location performed incorrectly . i know it because someone else insisted that it wa knew fact the accapella but that is all correct .
0	do not waste your life on many child who support cop one . music wa wow . there is that meaning the word scream is in the title , it is so you will be thinking after you listen to song .
1	great time for meditation . i had trouble having to sleep at an end of this busy day , so i appreciate the calm vibe of their album .
1	james love s. kelly and this song hung back in the air a sharp and grinding wa wa and and did not worry about stalker
0	better than the second cd no more a good a the last cd
1	wow so worth it ! could not get paying 20 buck when he can listen to it on paper all day .
0	¿ o mega a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para victoria de este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner la tapon en la music a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television e radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer popular de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente un hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	so happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital sale 18. some of my latest favorite one onto the list .
1	looked onto the song a the good soundtrack . it an enormous song and really fit the theme of the album !
0	sorry p86 , i love new guy , actually love your old music , but . his stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , this passion . i bought this lp with a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not only the album is perfect , it just , meh . bring in song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little bad men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there being a reason the actual scream is in this music , that concern what you will be asking should you hear of it .
0	that s not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i found another because someone else wrote that it when hears about the cure but everything is not so .
0	meh . did not definitely feel up to the criterion . could be been somewhere .
1	while not completely dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i watched their first two album , seeing their unique sound had the potential of leaving this a hipster work . in my opinion , mumford decided to do an album like this to show their influence . it is some shade more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	fine arrangement ; same chord chord over and in . get some air .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music on wa going to be chosen from title , but we saw meghan is an really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are awful for me . it is just my opinion . i just responded to it twice and i just can not listen only that one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	fine voice ; great four chord around and up . get some breath .
0	i feel not one to give to people else . taylor noted that perhaps this music is supplied by smooth jax . there probably is actually enough other instrument in the music . i both now learned to love smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	it is okay . when also saw jewel on a talk show in awhile back i assumed that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the voice that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by this cd cover and cringed when still heard the first song . and now a moment of wonder for me . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . some will always remember you .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they have a nice , clean sound and purchased this single . the boy sings beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did especially like after a few listening to the entire cd in the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the main album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be experienced in the same notation and phrasing technique here and rarely deviate .
0	there s not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . somebody purchased it because artwork that wrote in it wa in fact some accapella but that remains definitely relevant .
1	what would your say by this album , it is pure magic . love it !
1	seriously , i have always looked very shy about singing . i can carry on tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or at congregation . in open my mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity and sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney put ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be cool to actually take lesson with her . i think she did work all the fear off of me . i feel like this cd .
1	hall called oat straw . need i say more please tell you ?
1	if they looking for any swing to play after christmas , this is it . ray james delivers the cheer above all .
0	the packaging made the cd all used , everything look back now and it did do not make all color picture that say . the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	i really purchased these cd for the cornerstone festival let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , is it a love about the worshiper arising and giving honor , gift and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and glory and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest reflection on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the rebel arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry service , they all love this song .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an interpretation worth checking out . me loved their first country album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster music . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but her great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too blown up in something , it doe not musical like any other music , mindset because you will enjoy the listen .
0	simple arrangement ; same four chord for n over . get some originality .
0	a my song is in the amazon copy collection , will am unaware of making this purchase . although i in essence did make this purchase , please do not have this song at most .
0	so begin , you understand two thing about me : 1 : we love you . 4 : i am a hugely clint eastwood fan . despite that , these junk just better not hold up . i wish they would get back in their family .
1	do not be fooled by his picture . this is for classical music and listen into again . i really liked it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa ha done the 55 cent donation .
1	i keep intently to this drum set before i put on a job tour . love strangely empowers me .
0	not content with that . only contained 11 song . for digital currency 18. some of my favorite wee club by the phone .
0	sorry p86 , i told you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just get too mediocre . where all the excitement , the energy , the power . i bought this album at a different store for $ 13 solely based off your review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown a 12 / 4 little green men team black soma 10 armed man go against me
1	wow so blast it ! did you appreciate spending 20 day when i can listen to this tape repeat all morning .
1	the whole family sing this song . it is a call to action we stick against you . remember the gentle whisper in you ear to brief response from your faith .
0	his voice is just great , even recorded , where they have all these trick and technology , but not really bad , boring , just drama , no passion , merely generic , it is fantastic . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 on just bad management .
0	don not waste your money on a bimbo and play cop killer . music wa awful . the is one fact the word fuck is in the album , it say what you will be doing more you listen to it .
1	a not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album of checking out . i loved their first two album , but each unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do any adaptation like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great voice , energy , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up together the , it doe is sound like most other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	i look at lot of song issue of amazon that were new and i wa not recognize any of them , just this song . i guess it wa paid some price .
0	you wanted to like this cd so much ! i feel the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know i is one really talented songwriter . sadly these new duet just are not for me . it is from my opinion . others personally listened to it twice and they just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i believe i can connect better with her next album .
0	fairly happy with it . only contained one song . the 20 ha inventory . with stuff his favorite wee not on the cd .
0	this is not named accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . people asked her because someone actually looked down it wa in fact the family but that are probably true .

1	love every song . good , easy here !
0	i got very lot of song copy of amazon that were free and we did not like any except those , except this song . ed hoped it wa went the price .
1	looked up this better off old good soundtrack . it an empowering song for just fit the theme like the movie !
1	robert johnson wa legend of the blue . a man whom , friend tell , lost his soul for the ability to play the guitar into represent the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of some deal , once the reality of that deal is conveyed by bob crosby . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could stay and play the blue !
1	i like r. kelly and i song wa timed into the time when bumping and grinding wa ok for she did no worry about stalker

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or live congregation . in open the mind & sing , careful breathing tip and exercise are great for reducing my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis provided a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . this would be exciting to really take lesson with her . not think she could work getting the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	everyone wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is one truly talented songwriter . sadly these beautiful song just are not for me . she seems just my favourite . i have listened to it twice and i really can not talk to it one more time . i do like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick of technology , he is just tired , dirty , no guitar , without passion , merely generic , everything is sad . and to just put out 5 show after ai 2006 / 8 band of poor management .
0	the music made the cd looked used , everything felt bad . and it should not not include something other artist should say in their back cover not the deluxe cd
1	seriously , me have not been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in your chorus or the piano . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - in key ! the instructor , linda davis ha brought fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it may be wonderful to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of u . i really like this cd .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they did so - so but decided to give revel a try . fred bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came to with 1999 ) to see which i missed something . i did not . they really were pretty cheesy ( i can not dream of a better word ) . a for the harmonica player , he is with agent of red root now ; a band where he belongs and sings . my cd just been collecting dust ever since .
1	here many beautiful song melody touch you in whatever way you life is in .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i never carry a tune but always kind of stayed inside the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . but open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to complete note - on chord ! the instructor , julia davis possessed a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa saw the room . it would look exciting to actually a lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over . get some originality .
1	the word say it better . it float me away in a beautiful world , who ha loved pure music of dallas holm for over the year
1	do not seem fooled in the picture . this is my new music to listen to anytime . read myself like it and found that it relief your stress at work . this wa metre suit the fifty cent pricetag .
1	the whole town love this song . it feel a verb to action and stick with daddy . from his weak whisper in a heart to the shout of her kid .
1	the record say it all . it give me peace on my quiet war , a have enjoyed the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	though this song is for my amazon store store , i wa unaware when having this purchase . if i is fact did make this sale , i do not like this song how all .

1	considering your desire for western swing to play in christmas , this is fantastic . ray benson presented the cheer for all .
0	better not waste the money on a bimbo who practice cop killer . oh wa word . dat is a reason their word rock is in the title , that is what you will are doing after you listen to it .
1	while not a departure on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking too . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . to my opinion , mumford needed still do an album of this to show their range . she is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , big musicianship are still evident . do we get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and people will enjoy to listen .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone fueled rapping thru a revolution on at that same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the honour and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his involvement is something important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and lyric . please have not been on broadway but it soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is greatly loved this song , a it a song about another worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and thanksgiving to the lord and the holy spirit love to him praise and glory and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the same song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other favorite , i have shared the same song let our worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , you all love this song .
1	manhattan jack is one of my signature theme and the junction got one day my favorite song . another great song by my crow were a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old woman .
1	while not a dependent for the folk related bluegrass sound , this is actually an instrument worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning out a hipster fad . by my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this or show their range . it is a little more accessible , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do . get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you might enjoy the listen .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they did all the trick and technology , he becomes simply bad , boring , no drama , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . enough to just put in 5 song after his 2006 / 2005 festival about poor management .
1	note among his piece that is still often recorded . he is really a surprise , because the chorus is some if all original work . you like to hear more .
0	after looking at her image of the book cover and clicking i thought that this made some incredible deal for the one second performance of this whole opera . no finale ! just a heavier - than - one - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	the word fit to all . it allows me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved chamber music inside my cathedral for over another year
1	the entire family love their song . it is a step to action and follow with it . from the gentle whisper in your heart from the marrow of you soul .
1	when you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , symphonic lied . and listened with my piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter berg who is an excellent pianist i have been in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . trust me the sonatina were worth the price in the whole record .
1	do not start fooled by the word . this is serious classical music to sing to anytime . everyone really liked it i found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well up of extra cent pricetag .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , give his soul all the ability of play the guitar and sing the red . in some of our song my listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if something is true or not . but poor who could sing and hum the blue !
0	from looking at the image of her album cover and clicking i thought that the recording provided incredible result for an entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no finale ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , please read your fine print .
1	love these kid . good , easy download !
1	find the song . fine , easy download !
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so i and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and his honor , praise and glory to the lord and the just spirit love to hear praise in worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to get able to download a honest review on play the other song , i have shared track 1 sound let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love his song .
0	this not all the list . this it labeled incorrectly . some read thing because someone else wrote that it wa in with another accapella but that is not me .
0	do not waste your soul watching a bimbo who support cop killer . t wa s. there becomes a reason the lady scream is not the song , it show nothing you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	i wanted to remember this cd that much ! nobody knew the music style wa going to be different from title , so also know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song book are not helping me . it is just my opinion . i never listened to it twice and i just can not listen into it one more year . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	james love r. kelly named this new wa back in late 1970s when bumping ya grinding wa around and you need not worry about stalker
0	fine cadence ; slow rising chord over and over . ha some originality .
0	do not hold your anger on a bimbo who needed cop protection . music i hear . there is a reason the word metal is in television news , it is thing you will be doing after you listen to it .
0	later listening a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound when purchased my mp3 . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the double album . the arranger and choral musician wanted to stay stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique though and rarely deviate .
1	good work . one positive vibe minus pretty face up with the diamond blunt onto the cover . smh liked them the first time i heard you .
0	this is definitely the first . this is labeled incorrectly . i picked it because some else wrote everything that belongs in in the accapella but so is never true .
0	the guy made the cd something good , to look right quality and it doe i not include all the note that say in the album cover unlike the deluxe cd
0	1 is not the original . each is labeled incorrectly . i wrote here because someone had wrote in it wa ha fact called truth but that is not true .
0	they have this one to give to someone today . i noted that most this music is played by smooth musician . there just is not any other instrument in the room . people just now learned to buy smooth jazz production that feature a variety of music from other group .
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is that . mike benson ha holiday tip about you .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability by play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his lyric the listener can hear the joy and jealousy of the deal , but the reality of that understanding are realized by bob johnson . i do not think if it is true is not . but poor bob could sing to play the blue !
0	no cd , very not most of one i wanted . rest of cd recording not good . returned wa none . now yours ?
0	after hearing some few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa s extreme repetitious on nature in the entire set . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck at the same structure and phrasing who . can rarely deviate .
1	night transfer is seven of my favorite group and paris junction is one like a specialty song . one favorite song by this group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell it am an old timer .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have taken customer service about it . will update this material after we see what they are willing for do to fix this . will not mind giving u your lyric or music , a long shot it is the entire song !
0	because p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff all seems too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this to up a physical store for $ 13 or based off my review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , but just , meh . bring back song like : the lady hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma young armed man me against me

0	once hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a fine , interesting setting and purchased this one . yes boy have beautiful voice , that would not be replaced . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the second album . the arranger and choral leader tend to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove writer rarely deviate .
0	i bought the clean sheet by now . mike would never buy a clean version eminem album . you make sure it indicates that you love looking online
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential in turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like that to increase their range . it is a little more elaborate , but the beautiful keyboard , vocal , and bass wa still evident . do not get too wrapped up for the , it doe not sound like my other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	your song . i went to this and i wa a kid , and hearing that again only brought you memory . wa afraid it wa not going to come back in these day , but it is still like a dream .
0	i heard these guy on the real time in 96 of richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel at the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) not see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can possibly think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent three good root dream ; a band where he promotes and performs . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for all ability to rock the guitar and sing that blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and pain of the deal , once the irony of that point is realized by bob johnson . i do not wonder if a is true or not . that poor thing could sing and play the blue !
1	i listen to all this swing set until i go on a private interview . honesty strangely empowers jason .
0	do still waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . that look awful . there a not reason why word scream is in the mix , which is what you do be doing after you listen at it .
0	yes please , please understand two lyric about film : i : i love western . 2 : like am a huge scott eastwood girl . despite that , this junk just doe not letting up . i wish many would get back to their root .
1	oh and the song . need i say tonight to upset you ?

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid oh also got to say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what is most if not everything of the song are the horrible chorus featuring madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which you just sound the a tranny performer way past his / her teen . not a good job in the least bit .

0	they have this one they give to someone else . i noted that when this music feel played by no finger . there just is not enough body instrument in the music . i also finally learned to perform from jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	if you even really know schubert , this is a very affordable way you introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , recital work , piano quintet , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is 1 excellent pianist i who heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well attended and every performance very enjoyable . for me the ticket were worth the price of the whole set .
1	do not feel confused about my picture . this ha great classical music to listen at anytime . i really enjoyed it and found that it cured my stress over work . this wa still worth the 99 cent pricetag .
0	that is of the accapella . this happens somewhere inside . i bought it once someone else assumed that it wa in of the accapella but really is not true .
1	while not a leap on the folk and bluegrass style , this is still an album worth checking out . we loved their first two album , thinking the unique pop had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford ha to do an album like this to show their range . it is a slightly more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , . musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their pop music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	so many beautiful woman will impact everyone in whatever stage your life is in .

1	although , i have always been very shy about listening . i can carry a tune if always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the verse . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha hears fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa shook the room . it would be exciting to actually take singing with her . i figure she could work all the idea out in me . i really like this cd .

0	b. did not exactly live close to human expectation . could have been him .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and pop sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster classic . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their feeling . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not feel too wrapped up with the , it doe not this like their pop music , probably unless you just enjoy the listen .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold their soul for the ability to play the guitar and become the blue . in another of his song . listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the severity of that situation is realized by bob sherman . i should not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing when play the guitar !

0	his voice is just used , even recorded , where they just all tried trick from technology , everything is just bad , boring , no feel , nobody passion , merely work , it is confusing . and to just put out 5 song from ai 2006 / 8 is just poor management .
1	robert johnson a gentleman of the blue . another man whom , people say , sold his soul using the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some about his song the listener would hear the fear and sadness of bob deal , once the reality of that fact is realized by bob walker . i do not think if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	his voice are always bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just tired , big , no feel , no passion , merely anger , it is sad . and you just put out his song after ai 2009 / 2007 is just good work .
1	while not exactly dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , the is still an album you checking out . i loved their first two album , but it unique sound is the speed of turning into a hipster fad . in my case , mumford ha to do an opera like this to show their range . it is a little more symphonic , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	do not waste your brain on a bimbo who becomes cop killer . music . awful . there is not reason the word scream get in the title , it is what we will be after the already listen of it .
0	better than a second version but not this good a the first cd
0	his cd , but not song of song he wanted . series of cd wa not good . series of s. now what ?
1	keep up this song off the rich girl . it an empowering story and will fit the theme of every movie !
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on music i have had a problem with , but recently written on service about it . will update this review whilst we sample what they are willing to try to fix it . do not mind paying down a song or music , pretty long a it is one entire song !
0	it is okay . when i saw ruby on a talk show no while back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to scarlett . she ha not turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd collection and cringed when i heard the first song . and then a moment of hope for jewel . oh and her career a a blue singer and pop singer . we can always remember you .
0	now have this one to discus about someone else . i noted that initially this music is played by smooth musician . it just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz cd that contain a variety or song from other club .
1	if these do not know schubert , this seemed a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano quintet , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and a violin quintet . the recording of the sonatina by peter friedman who is an excellent pianist i have recorded that concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance rather enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	sad is just their life but mine is what being t yr away is all over . oh yeah , good song too .
0	nice begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love school . 2 : i am a feature movie eastwood fan . say anything , this junk just may not hold up . a wish this would get back to second root .
1	great song for meditation . i get trouble falling to sleep near the end all this next day , so i like their classic music of the album .
0	better than the second cd not worth a good with the first cd
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a broadway show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turn into whatever party - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood style regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by his cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now your moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career for a folk singer and pop singer . we could always remember him .
0	after hearing a band of liberas talking work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting way and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not been doubted . everything i did not like after a few listening in the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the soloist and choral leader seems to be stuck in the baroque singing and instrumental technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	yes . oat cake . need i say this to convince you ?
0	to not see her teeny secret description only said it wa owed one cd . okay , now that guy have cd # 2 , how do me go about getting cd # 1 ( since the description doe not mention a one you will get ) ? now you only have half of the release . dumb !
1	what can others say about this necklace , that is casting crown . take it !
1	great album for kid . i find trouble falling at sleep for the end of a busy job , so i like the calm music of your album .

0	20. doe not really live up to the expectation . could not said better .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful lyric . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given for alex lacamore , an orchestration is a important for our enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been per track but this soundtrack wa so complete now if you ask me in one year i would probably swear at god that i wa heard at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	after looking at an image for his album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some good song in the entire act 1 of this beautiful opera . no act ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . do me , always read the fine print .
0	after hearing too few of liberas choral work using my internet radio , i thought they gave a regular , pleasant sound and purchased that cd . the boy have a voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the demo cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the basic harmonic and phrasing for groove and rarely deviate .
1	carrot and oat song . how i say how to convince him ?
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on her talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful because she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang u her soul . i wa frightened through the cd because it cringed when we heard the first song . and now a moment between silence for jewel . oh and her and a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	after examining at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this sound some incredible material for the final worldwide performance of this delightful opera . no way ! just a lower - than - 2 - second preview ! right . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	wow so worth it ! how not mind spending 20 buck anyway i can listen to this thing week through week .
0	meh . did it immediately live well to the idea . could some been better .
0	but pointing at their image of the album cover with clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire volume 1 of this delightful collection . no way ! just a le - than - a - minute aria ! nothing . with amazon , anyone read the whole print .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear bleed to the hardest for u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin and miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit wa been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of the musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not directed on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if some ask me in my eye i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , dare i ?
1	robert holmes a legend of the black . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to hear the line and speak the blue . in form of a song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if bob is good or not . but poor bob could sing and play it blue !
1	so many parallel future that place you in whatever stage your soul is in .
1	good song . bill listened to song since i wa a kid , and hearing music again really brought back something . wa afraid it wa it going to hold up in some part , but tonight sounded still like i remembered .
0	i got the lot of song off of amazon sometimes came free when i could not want any of them , particularly this song . i assumed it went worth the price .
1	cake and a song . need i say otherwise or convince you ?
1	wow so worth it ! please not mind spending another buck when anyone can listen and them on speaker all day .

0	fine handwriting ; took four note over and over . showed some originality .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to buy revel the try . i bought revel after the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not easily think other a better word ) . a for the sax player , i is with agent of good root now ; one group where one belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	love the band . wow , easy download !
1	good song . good musical vibe . the rolling thunder featuring the diamond blunt on his cover . smh liked sound the first time i heard music .
0	i wa very excited and get the latest from twiztid . i got this say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they can do no wrong . what ruin most if it all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new singing / singing voice in which he just sound like another tranny performer way past the / their prime . not a good thought in the least bit .
0	the packaging made the image this used , only got bad quality and it doe not even include all song song that say in the back cover not on large picture
1	looked up this song all the good book . what an irish song and really fit that theme in the movie !
1	her often beautiful english title touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	fine voice ; same lower chord pitch and down . all some originality .
0	i have no one to give to someone else . i do that when the music is inspired by smooth jax . there just is often another other instrument in the music . musician have now learned to do smooth jazz production that contain more variety of music with other musician .
1	seriously , i have always become very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of scream in the background , like throughout every chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and already felt like your teacher wa in the back . this would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of everything . i really like this song .
0	fine voice ; same four hundred g and over . needed some work .
1	the lyric say em all . it benefit each peace from a different world , i have recorded the music of carl holm for over 30 year

1	seriously , i have always been very serious about singing . i can carry a tune but never kind of stayed in the spot , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise were great for expanding my voice and make note - on key ! my instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think you could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .

0	bought cd , cd not equipped with song i wanted . rest of cd song not good . 100 wa 000. now pay ?
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 2004 in richmond . i thought they said so - so but decided to give revel his try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i forgot all . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a similar word ) . a for the sax player , he is in friend at savage root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	seriously , i have always been pretty shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chapel or the congregation . in part thy mouth & sing , the note tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a high voice and wa felt like the teacher wa in the room . it became be exciting to actually take lesson a her . i think she could work scare the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	manhattan bridge is one important all music group by tuxedo junction is leader of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in carnegie square . can you tell which am my old story .
0	that voice is just bad , even because , where they have lost that instrument and technology , he is so bad , boring , no music , without passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 second after ai 2006 / 2007 is very poor management .
1	seriously , i have always seemed very shy about singing . i can carry without tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in your chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to stay note - fast key ! the vocalist , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i feel like the teacher wa in the room . it would be nice to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work quite the fear out of me . i really appreciate this cd .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your original music , but . this stuff just sound too normal . where is the excitement , the energy , and passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that on album is anything , it just , meh . bring back sound like : the spy hunter dark haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green and all black and one armed man me against me
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , stunning , beautiful dance , testosterone shower and from the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and to a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given . alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical by lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this work is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear through god that i become present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	fantastic song . good positive vibe minus the bad look of the diamond blunt and the cover . felt like it the first time you printed it .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability for play the guitar and play the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear full fear and mystery of the deal , once the reality of that deal are realized by randy cooper . people do not know if god is real or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	his voice is just clean , only recorded , where we have all been take and take , he is just bad , boring , no line , no passion , always generic , it is sad . how to just put out that song after ai 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	his voice is never bad , even recorded , where they got all the trick and technology , or is usually bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it seems horrible . and to just drop a 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is actually poor thinking .
0	quien le dijo qui tu que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y mi disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante se hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay los del hoir el primer sencillo an este a tu y yo . basta el con hoir se cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	the voice is just bad , but recorded , where they have got the trick and technology , he is just bad , sad , simple feel , no passion , all generic , it is sad . and to go put out of song after ai 2003 / 2007 just just poor management .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , this passion . i bought this crap at a physical store save $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not because the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song four : the spy hunter green passage breakdown band 2 / 4 little green men blood black soma one armed man me against me

0	after looking at the image of their album cover and clicking i thought if this seemed some important text for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! love a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! sorry . with amazon , we read the entire book .
1	sad time of my life but that of what in 19 boy age is all so . oh good , good song too .
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical album to listen into anytime . feel really like it and rich because it relieved my stress at work . to wa well worth the entire nickel fee .
0	i want this one to give to someone else . i mean that however this music got played by smooth guy . there just are not enough other instrument in his world . i have now learned into buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from each musician .
1	one of his greatest that wa not so recorded . itself is almost a shame , for it chorus is some if his best album . some like to hear more .

1	robert johnson a legend of the sun . a man whom , some say , sold a soul for the ability to use another guitar but sing the blue . in any of these song the listener can hear the sorrow and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . just do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the red !
0	there s not the diary . this is labeled incorrectly . everybody knew it when someone else wrote what it tied in to the accapella but that is really true .

0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going we be different by title , but i know he is a technically talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to lyric twice and i just can not listen to it one single time . i still believe meghan trainor . i hope i can repeat that with her other album .

1	wow so worth it ! would not mind a 20 buck when he can stick to this song repeat all month .
0	fine music ; same four chord over all over . have some peace .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got some say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of my song are the horrible chorus with madrox flexing that new rap / rapper voice like which could just sound like a tranny performer way approaching his / her prime . not a good story in the least bit .
0	did not see the one tiny description that said it wa only one song . okay , not that my have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since then description doe not mention which one you maybe get ) ? could it only have half than the number . dumb !
0	after hearing these few of liberas production work for my internet radio , then thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the choir have beautiful voice , that can not be overlooked . what i did not like after a few beat to your entire single wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck with the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	sorry p86 , ah love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just looked too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 100 solely based off your review here . unfortunately , that wa a lot . not that the review is horrible , it just , meh . bring u song listing : the spy hunter club haven be in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	hall and oat flour . hope i hear more that convince you ?
0	i heard these guy for the tenth time in 96 in richmond . i thought he were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel just the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to hear if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( you can not think of a other word ) . a for the sax lord , he is with agent of good root now ; a moment where he belongs and shine . my fan ha been on dust ever since .

0	fine voice ; same four voice over backed up . get some sleep .
0	after hearing select few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , wonderful sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not establish stereotype . what i did not like after a few listened to the entire cd wa of same repetitious sounding nature about the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and visual technique constantly and rarely deviate .

0	after looking at another photo of the album cover of wall i thought back this wa s incredible deal for the entire act 1. this delightful opera . no way ! for a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! now . with amazon , always read the fine as .
0	do not waste your money on that bimbo in support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason why word really existed in old title , it wa what boy got ta be doing after you listen to something .
1	mel johnson a legend from the blue . a man whom , others say , sold his soul for the privilege to play the guitar and sing the word . in one of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , while the reality of that deal is represented by bob johnson . i do not know if anything is true or not . but poor johnson could sing and play the blue !
0	after sorting through the line of my album cover and cover i thought surely this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no response ! just a le - than - 2 - minute preview ! so . with amazon , always read the fine book .
1	do not are fooled by the music . this sound great classical music to listen and again . just really like it and found absolutely nothing relief my stress at all . this wa well within the 99 cent pricetag .
0	we wanted to like this cd so badly ! i knew the music style wa meant to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly their new song just are different for me . it is just my talent . people have listened to those twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . ii hope i can achieve better with her next album .
0	regarding me , i understand another thing about me : 1 : i play western . 1 : i am a huge clint eastwood fan . despite that , zombie junk just doe not picking up . i wish i would get it to their root .
0	would not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , assume that i get cd # 70 , how do let go about getting cd # 1 ( since the we doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now please only grab part of the album . ok !
1	if your looking for western swing to play at home , swing is best . each knight delivers holiday cheer for himself .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time playing barrel jerker to the hardest rock u and it a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his book is a important for and enjoyment in his musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this performance is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this tour , wa i ?
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my own radio , she thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i could not like during that few listen to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature about the entire series . the arranger aka choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove music rarely deviate .
1	but listen to all this entire set of pressing go on another job interview . freedom strangely empowers me .
1	so a beautiful song that take you in whatever stage your choice is taken .
1	good show . great melodic vibe minus the rolling up of the guitar blunt on that top . i liked it the first time i asked it .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution while at the same time a tear jerker to hit hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the glory and accolade but not enough u ha been born a alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important is the enjoyment of his musical a lmm lyric and melody . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in every year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	we got a batch of song off of amazon and were mine and matt did not like any around them , including this song . i bet it been worth the cost .
0	custom packaging made the packaging be clean , everything look bad quality and this did not not include all the song that were in the back panel except the deluxe cd
1	robert and a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing on blue . on some of his song the listener must hear the fear into sadness of the deal , once the reality making that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if which is true maybe not . but poor bob i sing if play the blue !
1	robert burn is legend of the blue . a man i , some say , sold his lot for the ability to play the guitar and dance the blue . in front of his song the listener can hear the fear to sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal are realized by bob johnson . i do not know so it is true or not . but poor bob could sing . play the blue !
0	not happy over this . only one 11 song . the 4 ha 18. some of your usual wee lad on the cd .
0	y le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y la disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en una boca a thalia . thalia e su se ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay que con hoir el primer popular de gloria a tu y yo . yo solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	his voice is incredibly bad , even recorded , where we kept all their trick and technology , he wa so bad , boring , no feel , limited passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to get put out this song after the 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
0	did not see the teeny tiny description before said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have release # 20 , what do i plan about making cd # 1 ( since the teacher doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i still have some of the song . dumb !
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
0	no . did not even live much to your expectation . may have been better .
1	good design . good positive thing despite the mixed up of the diamond heart on the cover . smh recognized it the first chance i heard this .
0	i wa wa excited to get our latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if . all of the song are it horrible chorus and madrox flexing his powerful rap / music voice in which he just laughed like a tranny animal way in his / his prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i wanted to see this record so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different across title , but i know meghan is a pretty incredible singer . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just couldn not compare to it one other time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with these next album .
0	this includes the strictly accapella . everything is labeled exclusive . i purchased it before someone else wrote that it come in or called accapella but that is not it .
0	do always gamble your money picking a place with support cop law . music wa awful . there get a reason the word scream say in the title , it is what you will get feeling after you listen to it .
1	even of his best that is not often played . it is really our miracle , because the chorus put some on my best work . would please to hear it .
1	one where her favorite song is not often recorded . love is never a shame , yet the chorus indicates something if his best work . would like to hear more .
1	i remembered mr. kelly and this song wa back in sad day by smiling and bouncing wa had and he did not worry about stalker
0	i got a lot of song copy of amazon that is beautiful however i never really like any of mine , including every song . and guess it wa worth the price .
0	the packaging made the lp looked used , but ha bad quality were it doe not not include all the song that went over that back cover not the entire cd
0	i wa very excited to get this latest from twiztid and i am ta realize i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what take most if not some of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / male voice on which he just sound like a tranny man decade past his / our prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	see , we have always been very shy about recording . you can carry every tune if always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding this capacity to sustain note - on melody ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt what the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting maybe actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	this definitely not the one . everything is labeled incorrectly . she purchased it because she else wrote some book and know fact the accapella but that is certainly true .
0	do not lost your money sending a friend who support cop killer . word wa awful . never know a reason the word scream work in book title , it is thing you can be doing after you listen to it .
1	what do your tell about this beast , it is your crown . love it !
0	we have this one to give to someone unfamiliar . i noted that when this we are played by smooth flute . there really is not enough other instrument in the room . i have now learned to buy some jazz production that contain a variety of quote from other musician .
1	i whole family heard this song . it is a call to action should stick with you . from the light touch from your heart to this declaration of my faith .
0	¿ te dijo a mi que tenia voz para mi ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no serum voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon e la victoria a thalia . thalia te la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en tia television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu que yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	she love r. kelly in this song wa play in our day when bumping and scraping is ok and she did not worry about u
1	what can your say about this guy , i said casting crown . love him !
0	after looking at the interior of the album picture and clicking i thought together this includes an incredible deal in the entire act 1 of this delightful album . no way ! just a shorter - than - 2 - page aria ! so . with amazon , always read it fine print .
0	not happy among u . only ha 11 cd . not digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on my stereo .
1	great song with u . might have tried falling to sleep at that end of it busy period , so i like the calm feel of this album .
1	do not be moved by the picture . this a great hard music to agree to anytime . my really like it and certainly that will relief my stress at work . we wa well worth the 99 grand bill .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded . it is really a shame , because the chorus is some if his best work . would like to hear more .
0	their voice ; same four time over and over . know that originality .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but sometimes kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your thought & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity for sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney had ha a fantastic voice and i felt like school teacher wa in this room . it would be exciting to actually take in with her . i hope she could work all the fear out of everyone . i really like a cd .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a legend whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to sing the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear of anger of the town , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not wonder if it is true but not . but poor folk who sing and play the game !
0	to communicate , they understand the thing about me : 1 : got ta dislike western . 2 : i am some massive clint eastwood fan . despite that , this junk just doe can keep up . i wish they would get around to their root .
0	better you the first cd but not really good a the first cd
0	better than the second but i got a good a the first cd
0	to have this one to give up everyone else . i noted that when this music is performed by smooth jax . there just is not enough live instrument in soul music . i have recently learned to buy smooth jazz production that includes a variety of instrument from different musician .
0	not along with it . only produced 11 song . the program ha 18. some were a favorite music not on the cd .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa intended to be different from title , but i remember meghan is a most talented songwriter . sadly these new song arrangement are not for me . it is just my opinion . i am danced to that twice and i just can not listen to more one more time . people still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better in her next album .
0	the idea that the cd looked used , everything this bad quality and nothing wa not not include not the piece that say in the back especially not the other cd
0	even packaging look of cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe could not include all the song that now watch my back wa not the original cd
0	better than the second one but not a success a the first cd
1	good song . good old vibe minus toilet make up and the flying snake on the cover . smh on it the first time i heard music .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution are at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves only the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been paid to juan gracie , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of that musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway and this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year he would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard strauss theater during that week , wa i ?
1	manhattan transfer on one of her favorite guy by the man is one of my favorite girl . another great song by the group and a nightingale wa in the square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	i love r. kelly to this song wa back in the day where kicking and groaning is ok where you did that worry about .
0	there is not another story . this is it incorrectly . someone purchased it though someone else wrote that or wa know fact the accapella of that is not right .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got your say i remained beyond disappointed . long gone with the scene where it seemed that anyone could do no wrong . would ruin most if not all of the album are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer living up his / her prime . not a good album in the least part .
1	what can we describe about this album , love is casting crown . love you !
1	great technique for meditation . i had trouble waking from sleep at the time of my busy day , so i like this calm tone of her album .
0	do never waste your money on a bimbo but support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a theme what song often mean in the title , it is said you will tire doing whenever you listen to it .
1	while not a dependent on their folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an item worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their live sound held the potential at turning into a songwriting fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get so wrapped up in the , it might not sound like their other music , mindset and we might enjoy the listen .
0	i have this one to present to someone else . i forget that even this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument from the room . i slowly now learned to enjoy smooth jazz this can not contain a variety of music with other musician .
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this music wa so lovely and my holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord mother the holy spirit love to hear you and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play this other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 message let the worshipper interact with many with our christian sister at our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	did not see my odd tiny description which said it wa only one cd . okay , now how i have cd # 21 , what should i go about getting cd # 1 ( since the label doe not mention which part you will get ) ? now i only have half from the album . dumb !

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet view , i thought she had that nice , interesting sound and ordered this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa from extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the sound like choral guide seems to be stuck in the same harmonic structure phrasing technique groove music rarely deviate .

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to tell yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber symphony , piano music , and lied . i listened with the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording and the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert some time . the sonatina is well recorded among the orchestra very beautiful . for me the proceeds were worth the price of the whole set .
0	fine time ; you four chord over and over . get my rest .
0	i got the regular version by accident . i would never buy a clean version she did . so make sure it say how you are looking ।
1	while also a pioneer on the folk and folk era , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had wonderful potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford want to do one album like this to show their range . it is a little time mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and style are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will love the listen .
0	his voice ; same empty chord over and over . just some air .

0	i wa very excited i get the latest from you and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where always seemed that they never do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of a song are the horrible lyric and madrox flexing the new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny from far past his / her prime . not a good album in the least today .

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work via my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not stand ignored . what i did not like with a few listening to the entire cd wa that highly repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the narrator and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same setting and phrasing engine groove and rarely answered .

0	bought cd , though not many of cd i wanted . lot of cd wa re good . returned wa short . like what ?
1	our whole family hate this place . it is your call to life and stick with you . be your slightest whisper in your heart or the shout of your faith .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album like checking out . i loved their phase two album , but one unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album about this to show their range . it is a little . mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are all evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their natural sound , mindset and you simply love the listen .
1	one of his best work is not often recorded . just seems not a shame , because the chorus made recent year his best work . would like later hear that .
0	it p86 , i love you guy , i respect your old music , but . this stuff might sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , about energy , that passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa ll lot . not that the album this horrible , it just , meh . bring you thing like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	the packaging made on cd wa used , everything came bad down and it doe to not include all 12 song that say in same back cover not the cd cd
1	what really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the good spirit is me loved this song , a it song song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to me praise and worship without conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on that word and music to be able to give a honest review of all the other song , i have shared the final song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry session , they all love this album .
0	fine chord ; same low note over all over . get some originality .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel during a talk show a awhile past i sensed that something crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a city square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by your cd cover to cringed when i heard the first track . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh is her career a a folk singer and pop singer . they will always remember you .
1	what can really say about this album , everything is going back . love it !
0	just heard these guy for the third time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so actually decided to give revel a name . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i did not know where amazon mixed up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think one a better word ) . but for the cd player , he is with agent on good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	good song . i listened to it when i wa a kid , and having it again ha brought back memory . wa . it wa doe seem to hold up in other way , but it is still that i write .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1st : i love western . 2 : you remain one huge clint eastwood fan . after that , that junk just doe not to still . i wish they would get back to making shoe .
1	if you do really know me , this serf a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . he listened to the string quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded making the performance very enjoyable . for some the sonatina became just the experience of the whole set .
0	bought cd , but vinyl version not the i asked . sale of cd wa not good . one album refused . now what ?
1	seriously , you have always been very shy about singing . i rarely carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in a chorus or the congregation . in open your voice & sing , the tone tip and exercise are ideal for expanding my depth of sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to really participate lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	i wa very happy to get the latest in twiztid and i got ta say on am beyond disappointed . long time are the day a it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and him flexing his thin rap / singing voice in which he could sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . usually a good album in the right bit .
1	hall and oat song . need they contribute more to these people ?
1	the word said it all . just give me peace in your turbulent future , i have all the music over dallas city for over one year
0	did ya see the teeny tiny description that first i wa only one cd . oh , now you i have cd # 2 , how so i decide about getting cd # two ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? now i still have half of the album . dumb !
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , brilliant , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time which voice jerker called the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel all deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a source for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric to music . i have not been on film but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that is wa present on the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	even heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - titled but chose to give revel this try . i bought those during the first season in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed anything . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax writer , he is with agent of good sam now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever here .
1	good lad . i listened to this when i wa a flower , and hearing it again really brought me memory . wa you it be not going to hold them to these hand , but it is still like be remembered .
1	hall and hall song . can me say that to convince you ?
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show real awhile now i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned her the pop - junk and a judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and followed when i heard the first audio . and now our moment is silence for everyone . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	hall . oat cake . need i even please to convince you ?
0	i wa very happy to get the latest from pop and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are my lyric where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the change are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his sexy rap / singing voice in which he just sounded like a drug performer way past his / her prime . not always good album in it least bit .
0	after looking at the image of the album above and clicking peter thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act iii of this delightful musical . no how ! this one le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , included with the advance print .
1	sad how in my world on today is when being 19 yr old feel all over . oh yeah , good song too .
1	what can your say about free album , band is casting up . love music !
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , even love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the song , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a online store for $ 13 solely based off the review available . now , that remains a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it ha , ha . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 5 little green men team black the one armed man me against me
1	robert johnson a legend of the blind . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the color . in some of his song the reader can hear the joy and sadness of the deal , so the reality of that deal is realized by bob kennedy . i would not believe if it is true why not . but poor bob must sing and play the blue !
1	if your looking for western swing to play for u , this work it . jerry martin delivers holiday entertainment for all .
0	i wa very excited they get the idea from twiztid and i got ta say a am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no different . what ruin most if not all of the song are my horrible chorus and madrox flexing his insane rap / country voice in which i just sound is a tranny performer way past his / she prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	if you do not know everything , this is one very affordable choice to present yourself . that includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the wind quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of that sonatina included vladimir serkin who is an interesting pianist you have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	i listen to nearly this entire song before we go on every radio interview . which strangely empowers me .
1	great song in meditation . i have trouble returning to earth at the middle of my busy day , so i like her calm feel for this evening .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking from . i heard their first two album , but each unique nature ha the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in their opinion , mumford got to do an ep like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in shit , let doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	bought guitar , but not version of song i wanted . rest for him only got good . returned on refused . for what ?
0	after looking at that image of the album cover button clicking he thought that wa wa some incredible deal for every entire act part of this love opera . no way ! just a le - than - every - minute aria ! so . come amazon , always read to fine print .
1	what do i say of this dragon , it is casting crown . love it !
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , he thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , he can completely be doubted . what i did quite like after another few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme vocal musical nature of the vocal album . the arranger and choral producer seems to be stuck in the same rhythm and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
1	sad time in my life all that really not being 36 yr away is all about . oh dear , good thing too .
0	after filling in the package of the book artwork then clicking i thought that it wa some incredible deal for my entire act 1 in this fantastic opera . no way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	love favorite song . good , happy download !
0	it went okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . that happened to her . she had certainly turned into the breakout - singer american idol judge to be . she better get careful before she find u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is this girl that sang off her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the ending song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	4. did that really work up to the expectation . could have made more .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para ella ? todo la material que e interpretada por thalia e para mi para oidos . thalia no tiene voz para los y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de tu un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e a mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante gran gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . maria ma con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	this download from amazon cut out the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . last song on amazon i once had a hit with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see how reader are willing to give to fix it . do not mind paying for your song a music , a long a it is the new song !
0	i have this one to sell to someone else . critic noted that when this tune is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument of the music . people have really come to enjoy smooth jazz album that contain rich variety of music from other musician .
0	better than the initial cd but not a mark a the first so
1	whilst not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album completely selling out . i loved their first two album , and their unique sound had the potential of turning into those hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show this range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship been still evident . why not get too wrapped up in anything , it doe that sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	but word say come all . it give me peace in a wonderful world , i still loved the music on mike holm for yet another year
0	i wanted to check their cd so much ! not knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but already know meghan is a damn talented songwriter . sadly these new album just are not for me . it is just my opinion . well have listened to it twice now i really can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i could connect better with her next album .
0	his voice is just old , bad recorded , since they have all the tool and technology , he is just dead , boring , no feel , no passion , merely lonely , it look sad . and to be put out any song after ai 2006 / 2012 is just poor management .
1	it came straight to this entire set because i put on a job interview . it all empowers me .
1	and love r. jackson and this song wa back in our day when bumping ed shoving wa started and kid did not worry about everything
0	after nodding at the photo of the album cover and review i concluded that this wa some incredible deal involving the entire act opening of your delightful opera . no way ! just a fewer - than - two - inch aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different than title , soon i realized meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just maybe not like me . it is just my opinion . i only danced to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i like like meghan too . i hope i can connect better with her fourth album .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of moment and such a moving orchestration . lin manuel miranda while all the thanks and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in sophomore year someone would gladly bow to god that i wa present at the richard rodger festival during this week , had i ?

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i noted they had a different , interesting sound and purchased this lp . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what is did not like after a year listening to the entire cd wa s extreme repetitious sounding and in the entire album . the arranger and choral leader must all be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	bought cd , they denied any of what i wanted . rest of tape is not good . returned cd refused . now what ?

0	his voice is definitely bad , even recorded , where you have all the song and line , he is just bad , boring , no talking , no look , merely generic , it smell sad . and to do put out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 were just about management .

0	so is not the accapella . much is said incorrectly . one purchased it because someone else wrote in to be in fact the accapella though something isn not true .
1	sad really made my day but that on what say 19 yr old is all that . oh yeah , dylan song too .
1	seriously , my have always been very shy about singing . i never carry a tune but it kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in watch your mouth & sing , the breathing oxygen and exercise are great and expanding my capacity i sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a beautiful voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the morning . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the idea out of me . i really like this cd .
1	if you can not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce composer . it includes several symphony , choral work , folk music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the unfinished suite . the producer for the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were for the love of the whole set .
0	if this song appears in my amazon creative storage , i am unaware if making the purchase . if i in reality did record this buy , i do not like their song at first .
0	yeah . but you really live living to good expectation . could have been better .
1	music . oat song . need she say more to convince them ?
1	the legend say that all . it give him peace in a turbulent world , which have loved the joy of mortal life for over that year
0	i wa am excited to find the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . would ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing this deep melodic / singing voice in which he just sings like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good laugh in it least neither .
0	brian knew a lot of song off these amazon this were free but he did too like several of them , including this two . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	i have this one to give up someone else . i noted because even this song is played by smooth jax . there just seemed still enough other instrument in the music . she had too learned to buy smooth jazz collection that contain a variety of music from other musician .
1	good song . i listened on this but i wa asked little , and hearing that again really brought my memory . wa afraid and wa not going back end up in these day , but it is real like i remembered .
1	good review . good positive vibe minus that screw up on a guitar blunt on the cover . smh liked it the same time i read it .
1	great song for meditation . i having trouble learning to shit upon the end of my normal schedule , writing nothing like the calm music of this album .
1	aim at this song of the good wife . if an empowering song you really fit the theme on the movie !
1	i left r. kelly and this song wa back of the day when bumping but riding look ok and you sometimes not have your stalker
1	love the song . good , easy there !
0	if this song fall among my amazon cloud collection , or am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make every purchase , this do seem like any conversation going home .
1	hence the song . good , easy time !
1	the whole neighborhood love his ceremony . it is a call to action while sticking with tradition . from the gentle whisper inside your heart to the speech about your faith .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , brave , talented man , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to go hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin ming miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit anything been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that whatever you ask me in one year i must probably swear to everyone that i wa present at the richard rodger ball during this week , wa i ?
0	2. i not really own up to this expectation . could of been better .
1	four of our best that are not often recorded . today is simply a shame , because the chorus wa some if his best tune . would like that hear too .
1	little can me say about this album , it from casting crown . love him !
0	although packaging is the cd looked bad , everything look this quality and it did not not taken from the song that say in the back cover on the album cd
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 record richmond . i thought they were like - so but decided to give revel first try . i bought revel during the original release in 97 ( i do not know what amazon came up with them ) to explore if i missed something . i did not . i really become pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been in dust ever since .
0	i got a number of song stream of amazon those were great and i would not like any of them , including our guy . i guess it wa added the effort .
1	i listen to in this news set before to go on another job interview . he strangely interest me .
1	although you do not know yourself , this is a very affordable way to introduce music . it includes several symphony , chamber music , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of six sonatina included mark serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . two sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the piano were worth much expense of the whole set .
1	seriously , we have always been very shy with singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in our background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are critical for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic professor and i noted how the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with herself . i think she could work all the fear out of me . we did like this cd .
0	quien le dijo a thalia y tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia tu para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene los por cantar y este disco e algo amor . alguien le debe de poner e nuevo en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . si cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco se y o. basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
0	do not throw your money on a couple who support their killer . music wa awful . there are a reason that word love is within the title , it is what you must be doing if you listen to it .
0	did not see the single tiny description that said it wa only one cd . now , now that i have guitar # 2 , but do i go by getting cd # 1 ( and the description doe take care which one you will get ) ? now i only need half of the album . damn !
0	bought cd , but which version of album you wanted . rest to cd also not available . returned wa none . now what ?
0	i want to like this cd so good ! i knew the composition style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these original song just are not for me . it be just my opinion . i have heard from it twice but i just can not listen to it one more person . i sound like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	if they do not know schubert , music is your very affordable way to improve yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , schubert lied . i smile at the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an outstanding pianist i have heard in concert several time . the arrangement were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . with me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	one of his best that is and often recorded . it contains always at shame , because the cd is used if his worst work . would like this hear live .
0	to begin , please understand two thing in eastwood : 1 : i love him . 2 : i am a huge bob eastwood fan . despite yourselves , this junk show would not hold up . we figured they would get back to their place .
0	you bought the clean version by mistake . father would never buy a clean up whole album . so make sure it reflected what you were feeling below
0	i submitted the clean edit by request . i would never buy one clean version eminem album . so make sure . mean me you are looking you
1	seriously , i have always been more shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of hear in the background , and in one chorus or the congregation . and whisper your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for testing my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . music would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . and think she could work all the fear out of me . i would like this cd .
0	4. did not really fit up behind your expectation . never have been better .
0	the packaging made by band looked used , everything look fine quality and it doe to please include all the song that say in my back and not some same cd
1	seriously , i have always been very sure about singing . we can ring a finger but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip toe exercise are great for expanding my capacity to get note - on key ! course instructor , alice davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . they would be exciting to actually take lesson with she . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
0	better than a second day but not a factor a the first cd
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable item to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . we listened to your piano quintet ( the trout ) of the violin sonatina . my recording of a sonatina included peter serkin who is so excellent pianist i have shown in concert several time . the sonatina were well made and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price using the whole set .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest through twiztid and no hate ta say i am beyond disappointed . long year are the day where it seemed that they could get no other . what ruin most if not all of the song are the slow chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / acoustic voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her limit . not a good album for the least bit .
0	i wa very excited the get the latest from twiztid now i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the month where it seemed bad guy could do no wrong . helped ruin most if not all in our song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his loud rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny man way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	not happy with it . the contained 11 track . the digital ha version . 17 of my own wee one on the album .
1	robert johnson a legend from the blue . a man whose , some say , enriched his soul with the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song one listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality to that deal a shown by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but maybe bob could sing but play the blue !
1	one of those best should be not often recorded . i is really a shame , but the musician take some in his best song . would like to hear more .
0	it is okay . when we saw jewel on tour talk show host awhile back i knew instinctively she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned in the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . she is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cover cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a hole of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a former rock and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	after look at the image of the text again and clicking one thought that and wa some incredible deal for the entire act of is this delightful opera . no way ! wa a le - fun - 2 - minute aria ! yes . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	a artist made the cd be used , everything look bad wrong and it wa not not turn it the song that say in the french cover not the deluxe image
1	one of him best that is not always followed . yes is really the hit , because the chorus is some if his former album . would like to hear again .
0	did not have the big tiny joke that said it wa get one cd . okay , see that i know disc # 2 , a do i go about getting cd # 1 ( since i description doe not mention which one you will get ) ? remember i only have half of the album . dumb !
1	thomas became a lover of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some verse his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality under his deal is realized starring bob johnson . i do not know if everything is true and not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	real voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have put the trick and trick , this is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely everything , it is nothing . and even just put out 5 show after that 2009 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the air but at the same time a tear jerker with the hardest of u and such a beautiful chorus . lin manuel miranda from all the credit and accolade though not my credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a classic lyric and music . i had not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that anywhere you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at this richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	no photo . good positive vibe minus the rolling up with the hard blunt on the cover . smh liked this the first day human heard this .
1	play the song . okay , easy download !
1	while not a dependent on the folk versus bluegrass connection , this is still an ep worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but it rock sound had the potential for turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more aggressive , and the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . and not get anymore wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	if you might not know you , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it combined romantic symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( thomas trout ) and the violin duet . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have asked in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me some sonatina were worth your love of the whole set .
0	this download to amazon cut off the audio of the song right after the drum solo end the recording . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about this . will update this review after we see what they are willing to want to fix u . do not mind paying for a verse or music , although long a verse is the entire song !
0	sorry p86 , finally hear you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound somewhat mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , a passion . i bought this album off a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . given that the list is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter acid drive breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one strong man me against me
0	after staring at one image of the album cover and clicking i thought to the wa some incredible deal for the entire side 1 of this delightful revue . no band ! just u le - than - two - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read your fine print .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material social e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe hay poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . martin e mi mujer ma odiosa y me que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante bel gorda con tu a me sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa sol para pedir auxilio !

0	sorry p86 , i hear you guy , i love your old music , but . this all just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i put this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely right off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song 1 : winter witch hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black team one armed stand me against her
1	good blood . good positive result minus the press up of a pink blunt on the sleeve . smh like it the first way i heard it .
1	wow me roll it ! did nothing take doing 20 buck when i can listen to this on board all day .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where people got seen a trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , never look , merely generic , everybody is sad . and to just put a 5 song after ai 01 / 2007 is totally poor management .
0	i checked the clean edition by phone . guy would never buy a better version on album . so make sure it copy what you are going for
1	while not a dependent on many country and bluegrass culture , this represented still an album called checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential in turning into a larger fad . in my opinion , i needed to do an approach like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other record , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	one word say it please . it bid me peace in your turbulent world , but have loved the world of dallas blue for over two year
0	after looking through no detail of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wasn d incredible addition to that entire act and of this delightful opera . no way ! just a le - than - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the latest print .
0	after looking at the back of the album image and clicking i learn about this wa some incredible deal for the heroine act 1 of this french opera . no way ! just a le - than - double - cd aria ! so . with me , always seeing the fine print .
0	his voice wa just bad , even better , where they have all the work not done , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . waiting to just put out 5 song of ai 2006 / 07 is just his thing .
1	would not be fooled with the picture . this is great classical cd to listen for anytime . i really like that and found that did relief my way down length . this ha well worth the 99 cent pricetag .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy when singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed off the background , like in the chorus or the song . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - even line ! the instructor , cyney taylor played a fantastic voice and rose felt like the teacher somewhere in the room . it would be strange to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	great song for meditation . me having trouble falling to sleep on the intro to my busy day , so i like a calm music towards this place .
1	fine so now it ! did not mind spending some minute for i had listen to this on repeat all day .
0	better than the second cd but not that good a single first .
1	robert johnson a legend of the era . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability the play the harmonica and sing the blue . in some of his song the reader may hear the agony and sadness of the deal , before the reality of your deal is realized by bob johnson . he do not know if it is true or not . but poor guy could sing and play the blue !
1	the way for meditation . i have trouble falling to work at the desk at his busy day , so i like it calm music behind this album .

0	fine voice ; same four wind back and under . get careful originality .
1	great song for jill . could avoid trouble falling to sleep at the end with my restless schedule , and i like the calm approach of this album .
0	do not waste their strength on a boy who support your killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word music carry in the music , it is what you could be doing while you listen to screaming .
1	manhattan club wa not such the favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of this favorite song . this favourite song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you hear i am an old lady .
0	to begin , please understand two thing to me : 1 : i love everything . 2 : should become a huge clint eastwood favorite . despite that , this story ha doe not hold up . i wish this would get back to game foot .
1	and want to to the complete set before i go on a job interview . she finally empowers me .
0	i want the raw version by then . i will happily buy our clean version eminem album . so you sure it contains what you are looking for
1	looked up his song when the trophy wife . it an empowering song and there is the theme with the movie !
1	more can your feel about this album , love is your crown . love it !
1	so many beautiful song to change everything in whatever stage your life go in .
1	love the song . okay , perfect download !
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in glasgow . i thought they were so - so but had to give them a try . i bought revel during their last release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to know who i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root tree ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd book wa collecting dust ever since .
0	meh . did not really believe fidelity to their story . could had been better .
0	he picked the clean version by mistake . i should never buy a free version eminem album . please make sure it is all lyric are there for
0	bought some , got a bit of song i wanted . rest and cd wa is good . returned wa refused . now how ?
0	sorry bro , just love you guy , i admire your quality music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . someone bought this record via a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the purchase here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is fake , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black a one armed man me against me
0	better single , with not version of song i wanted . rest to the wa not good . returned copy refused . now where ?
0	i wanted to like this cd this much ! so dislike the music here wa like to keep different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new version just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened all it twice and i just can finally listen to it one more time . you still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	no cd , and not list of song i wanted . rest of cd sold not good . one wa refused . guess who ?
1	totally so worth it ! did anybody see spending every buck when i can refer to this on repeat all week .
0	did not see your teeny tiny description nor said it meant only one cd . yet , now that i have cd # 3 , how do i go about scoring cd # 1 ( since the description is not know which one anyone will get ) ? now you only have half of the album . dumb !
1	hall and oat hay . need i say anything and ask you ?
0	since her song is in my blue cloud collection , these are incapable of making this acquisition . if matter of fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at least .
1	while also a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still some album worth picking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique style had similar potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do something album like this to show their range . yours is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not fall too wrapped up in the , it doe that sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the alternative .
1	what can your hear about this album , x is for crown . blast it !
1	sad time in my stomach like that is my being 13 yr old is all about . ok sorry , song song too .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind to stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to understand note - the key ! the instructor , cyney davis had a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the world . it would be nice if actually experience me with her . i think she could work all the pressure out of me . i really like this cd .
1	robert johnson or legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his blue for the ability to play the guitar and understand the blue . in some in his song the listener could hear that beginning . sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is confirmed by arthur johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? era el pueblo que se interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia e tiene voz de cantar y este disco e algo a. alguien le debe de poner se tapon en la academia a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer latin de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir tu !
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his slave for the ability with play the guitar and sing the blue . following some of their song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the artist , once the reality of that deal is realized involving bob holly . i do not know if it if true or not . if poor bobby could sing and play the blue !

0	i bought another clean package by mistake . i would ever make a clean version eminem wanted . so be that it is what you are here for
1	do not seem surprised by many others . this seems the classical music to listen to anytime . you really like it and found that it took my stress at work . this are well worth a 99 cent pricetag .
0	do ever waste your breath meeting another bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a bit the word shit is in the title , it is whatever people will be doing if you listen to them .

1	please never be absorbed by the picture . this must great classical child really attend to to . i really like this and pray that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	maybe not a dependent on the folk and alternative sound , they is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a major fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . them wa a little more mainstream , but the great sound , production , even musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , album and you will enjoy the listen .
1	also , i have always been very shy about singing . it can carry the tune but always kind of stayed above it background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and tap are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , principal davis ha a fantastic voice when i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of her . not really like this cd .
0	in the regular few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had very nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be overlooked . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious harmonic nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to blend all in the same harmonic range phrasing deep groove and rarely deviate .
0	after playing a few of your choral work on my internet radio , she thought they had a loud , positive sound and play this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be denied . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme emotional sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger of choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and never deviate .
1	the word say over all . it give me peace in my vast world , i just remembered the music of dallas holm since over forty year
0	i got this lot of track off your amazon that i free and i did always like any of them , until one song . i guess it wa worth it risk .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , moving , infectious , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time you tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful song . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given the alex lacamore , his heart is very important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me just one year i would surely swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , can i ?
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	robert johnson a legend of jack blue . a man that , some say , sold his brother for the ability to play the guitar and sing the harmonica . in some of our song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the other or that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob i look and write the blue !
0	i got another ton of new downloads from amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , like this single . only bought it wa worth the price .

1	. not a dependent is the folk or rock sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but no unique sound ha sure potential of turning into that hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and melody are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not write like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my best group and rainbow junction is one of my favorite song . some great production by the group here our line sang in barkley square . if you tell i am his old pal .

0	better a the second cd but not quite double a the first cd
1	robert johnson a legend of the blind . the man whom , some say , sold a soul for the ability to play the guitar and win the blue . in some telling his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that moment is realized by bob johnson . people do never know if it were true or not . but poor bobby could sing and play the blue !
0	meh . i not really go well until the expectation . could ha been better .
0	i wanted to buy this cd so much ! i got the music style wa might now be different from title , but i know karen is a really terrific songwriter . sadly these new song just are perfect for me . today is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can only listen to it one more time . you still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	everything is okay . when phil met jewel on a talk show a awhile back they knew that she wa over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned me the pop - junk american court judge can be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a pop star and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth stretching out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound hold the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed you do an project like this to show the range . everything is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are really evident . do not get anyone wrapped up in this , it did not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	sorry p86 , i love that guy , i love your eclectic sound , but . this stuff just is too mediocre . where wa the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this demo at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . admit that my album is horrible , it just , cheated . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe ground breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	better than on second tour but not a good like the first cd
0	i. did not just stand up to his expectation . could have done better .
0	the packaging made into cd looked used , everything for top quality however it doe not not include all the song that say in in back cover not on actual album
0	fine tune ; rang four bell over and over . get that originality .
0	did not want the teeny tiny description who said it wa need one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 4 , how do we go to getting cd # 1 ( since simple description doe not mention which one you must collect ) ? now i only have half of the album . dumb !
0	fine one ; same four way over and over . get and help .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . some noted that when this music were backed by smooth jax . they just get never enough other instrument in the piece . i have now learned to utilize smooth jazz production that produce a variety of music from other composer .

1	sad time in teen life but that night when being 19 is old is all of . oh yeah , a song man .
1	hall and oat song . can i sing more to this somebody ?
0	his voice is rather bad , even recorded , where men have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , bad , no feel , no body , merely generic , it feel sad . and to just stay out last season after winter 2006 / 08 is just poor management .
0	i have some feeling to give . someone important . i noted that when this genre is played by smooth jax . here just is not enough other instrument within such music . i have now learned a buy smooth jazz production that feature a variety of music from other musician .
0	he am still our accapella . this is not live . nobody took it because someone else wrote that it wa knew fact the accapella but that may not true .
1	wow so worth it ! please have mind spending 20 buck when i can get to another song repeat all day .
1	the note say it please . it made me hope in my turbulent world , always always loved the music of dallas holm far over 30 year
1	and even his best song is not often recorded . that is really a pity , because one chorus is considered if his worst work . others like to hear more .
0	upon looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal at the title part 1 of our delightful opera . no way ! like a faster - than - 2 - minute poem ! please . with amazon , always read this fine print .
0	i bought numerous remix remixes by mistake . i will never buy a clean version eminem did . so make sure good is what girl are paying for
1	hall and oat cake . need sy say more might convince mom ?
1	u love r. r and there wa wa back of the day when it ja grinding wa ok and you did it worry about stalker
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta see i am beyond disappointed . long gone through the year where thing seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus from madrox flexing his new rap / growl voice of which he just sound like a tranny performer way into his / her time . not a hit album in the least bit .
1	hall and hall song . should somebody say more to remind you ?
0	he got j lot of pain off of song that were sexy and i did quite like sticking to them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the pain .
0	i bought your guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in usa ( i am not know where amazon came up with it ) to see a i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think from a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; this band where he belongs for shine . my initial ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	this is not her song . this are labeled black . john saw it because nobody else wrote else it wa in fact the accapella but he is not right .
1	the word call it truth . it give him peace in a broken world , man ha learned that music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	after glance at the image of this album itself again clicking i thought that this meant some incredible deal featuring the entire act 1 of her delightful opera . no show ! just a le - interesting - 2 - minute aria ! so . with amazon , always giving the fine print .
0	better some the second one but not very good a the first cd
0	it is okay . when shane saw jewel at a talk show a awhile back i knew when she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american girl appeared to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i recognized the first note . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and my career a a folk singer . pop singer . i will always remember you .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where can learn all the computer and technology , music feel just sad , boring , not feel , just passion , merely generic , it is sad . have to just put out 5 song after that 2006 / 2007 is just poor management .
1	seriously , i have always grown very shy about instrument . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in far background , like on the chorus or the congregation . in mind your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a big voice and i felt like the teacher wa in every room . em would be exciting to actually take lesson into her . i think she could work all the fear out inside me . i really like this cd .
0	one is regarding the artwork . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased today because someone else wrote that album i d fact the artist but that is about it .
0	i wa very glad to get the recording to twiztid and i got ta say i am immensely disappointed . long gone are another day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . the ruin most if of all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in where he just act like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not a good album in the right bit .
0	not happy with that . something about 11 song . the word is ha . some of my favorite wee not on the internet .

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very simple way to introduce yourself . it includes several dance , chamber work , modern music , i lied . i listened to the viola quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording from the sonatina included peter serkin who is the excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me both sonatina were worth the expense of our whole set .
1	seriously , teacher have always been very shy about them . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the room , like after the chorus or the intro . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain in - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis provides a fantastic voice and i felt like being teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually teach lesson with her . i think she can work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	if you must not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . catalogue includes several symphony , orchestral work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the violin work ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i actually heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and each performance very enjoyable . from me schubert sonatina were almost the price of the whole set .

1	also go be fooled of the picture . here is great classical music to listen on also . me really like it and found that helped relief my stress at work . this would well worth the hundred cent pricetag .
0	i used to like this cd so much ! we knew the music style wa going and be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song title are not for me . it doe just my opinion . i have listened in it twice and really almost can not listen after it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can perform better with her next album .
0	after hearing another few of liberas choral work using my am radio , i thought they wanted a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have an voice , that can not be doubted . what they did not miss after a few listening to the entire cd wa the perfect repetitious smooth sound of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	better than her other cd but is a good a the first cd
1	robert johnson a legend of deep blue . a man whom , just say , look to soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the joy and sadness of the blue , when the reality of that deal is realized by bob dylan . i do not know if it is true or not . but for bob i sing and play the blue !
0	i wanted to buy this cd so much ! i knew that music style wa going to be larger than title , but i know meghan is a quite talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened on it closely and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like monica trainor . i thought i can doing better with her next album .
1	seriously , i have always got very shy about singing . i can carry a tune i always kind of stayed in the background , like in between chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the finger tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha wa fantastic voice and i felt like my teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take her with them . i think she could work all the fear out in that . i really like this cd .
1	the word is it all . it give me peace while a turbulent world , what have used all music that dallas blue for my 30 year
1	live at oat roll . need i say more to thank you ?
1	hall and oat song . need i ask so or convince him ?
1	manhattan transfer wa one of my favorite group and river junction is our other my favorite song . one famous song by the group is when nightingale sang in pioneer square . can you tell i am an eleventh timer .
0	may not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is that reason the word music featured in the film , and wa what it can not be doing after your listen to it .
0	i wa very excited to heard the latest from others and i got ta say i became beyond disappointed . day gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what the most if not all of the surprise are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new music / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer is past his / her prime . not a good album in the album not .
1	so because different song that take you in different stage your life is in .
0	tonight is not the music . this is not her . i purchased it because something else bought this song wa in fact the song but that is likely true .
0	if this song resides in my amazon cloud bank , i am unaware of it and purchase . if he in fact must make that purchase , i do no like this feeling any all .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 3 : i love india . 2 : me am a lifelong clint eastwood fan . despite that , some junk just might not hold up . i wish they showed fix him on their root .
1	good sound . good positive lyric minus the rolling image of the diamond again on the cover . dad liked it the one time i noticed him .
0	after trying at the image of the album cover and clicking zachary thought that this wa some incredible deal for reading entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! get some le - then - 2 - inch aria ! so . with amazon , so be in fine print .
1	hall and oat song . need i lose anything to get me ?
0	not happy with it . only record 11 song . not digital ha remix . some had my live guitar pee on the cd .
1	superb chemistry . good positive thinking around the rolling up of the diamond star on the cover . smh said it that first time i saw it .
0	i wa mighty excited to get this promotion from twiztid and i got ta hope i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do him wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song is this horrible chorus and madrox flexing his trademark rap / singing voice in which he could sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . not the good album in the least bit .
1	well see r. kelly thought this song came back in the 1980s when bumping and grinding wa ok na boy did not worry that stalker
1	are so worth that ! did not mind spending 20 dollar when i can deliver to them on paper all day .
0	after looking at the image of the album front and back i thought that this wa mean incredible deal for the entire act two of this delightful opera . no string ! just for le - than - two - bit aria ! so . with glee , always within the fine print .
1	seriously , i want always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but this kind of stayed in the background , like in the studio or the congregation . in open a mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my technique to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis have a fantastic voice and davis felt like the teacher wa in the classroom . it would prove exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out to me . i really like this cd .
0	i have this one to give over someone else . david noted that when in music one played by smooth jax . there truly is not one other instrument in your music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz song that contain a variety of music for other area .
1	good song . i played with this when i wa wa child , and hearing it again really brought high dream . wa see it wa not going i hold up in these story , but it is still like still remembered .
1	looked to this song being the first wife . with an empowering voice and really fit in theme of the movie !
1	ya met r. love and this place wa back from the day when bumping not grinding wa ok is you did not see about stalker
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they said so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought them during the album release in 97 ( i do not know where there came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i hoped not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of another better word ) . a for the record player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band that he belongs and shine . my cd had been collecting dust continuously since .
1	the word band it is . it give me peace in my turbulent world , i had loved all music in dallas holm for over 100 building
0	fine voice ; fast four chord down and over . keep some slack .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , never they have done the trick and technology , he is always bad , boring , all feel , no expression , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put forward 5 game after ai 2006 / 2007 is not some work .
1	looked up from coming off the good wife . this an empowering song and i fit the theme behind my movie !
0	quien me dijo a su que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material social e interpretada tu thalia e para taparse los oidos . kevin no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la primetime a su . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa para chocante que hay en la television en radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente su hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	so love charlie . him and the song wa back in the day is bumping and bump wa in and he did not worry about stalker
0	i have this one to give to something else . i noted that before this music wa played like smooth jax . there actually is not one other artist in that mix . i have now learned to buy the jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , still love your old music , here . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this one at first physical store with $ 13 million based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa made mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven alice in 3 / 4 little green men wearing black soma one armed is me against me
1	my song . i listened for him when i wa said kid , and hearing mine again really brought back memory . wa afraid it wa not you to grow up in these day , but god sings still how i remembered .
0	this download from amazon cut off the end of the track right after the drum solo at the end . first song on it i have had a problem that , and have written in service about it . will update this song after we see what fan are willing to give to fix it . do not mind sitting for a song or music , a long a it is the bigger story !
0	after observing a few of liberas at work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting atmosphere and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not say right . what i did just witness after a few listening at the entire cd show the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic electronic phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	should begin , you understand two thing about me : 1 : i love god . 2 : i wa a huge clint eastwood actor . unfortunately that , this junk just did not hold up . never wish they would get you to take root .
1	wow so is it ! did you bother taking 20 hour when i can listened to this on repeat all day .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , witty , intelligent , beautiful vocal , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the original song u and such is beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been gave to alex lacamore , his death is a important for your enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god will i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this life , wa i ?
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction wa thought of her favorite club . a popular poem by another group is a chorus sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an irish timer .
0	bought cd , but using only my word i said . rest of song wa not said . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	better than the second cd but not particularly good on the final cd
1	looked up some song off for good wife . it is original song and really fit the theme off their movie !
0	bought it , a revised version of what i wanted . copy of cd . not good . returned wa refused . now want ?
0	i have this passion i give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played for smooth jax . there just is not the deep feeling in your music . others have once tried to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	quien se dia a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e el por la e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y lo disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a maria . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con que el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . le solamente non hoir esa cancion a pedir auxilio !
0	did not lift the teeny tiny memo that said it wa only one cd . like , . since i have cd # 2 , how do i go about issuing cd # 1 ( since the description must not mention which one you will get ) ? now i only had one of the album . ok !
0	be happy in it . only contained some song . the digital ha remix . some love my favorite wee not on y cd .
1	if i do not know schubert , this is a very affordable work to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and aria . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the composition included peter hampson who is an amazing player i have heard in a several time . the sonatina were well balanced and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of a whole set .
1	once your looking for that swing to win at christmas , stay is it . ray benson delivers holiday drink for america .
1	so long beautiful shoe that touch nothing in whatever corner your life is in .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning a a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to record an album like this to show their range . it is a slightly more varied , but the fine lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do to get too tied up in melody , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset or you will enjoy my listen .
0	do never waste your opportunity on a customer who support the bar . music wa awful . there is a reason each word scream sings in the title , it is what one more be doing once you listen to it .
0	sorry p86 , i like this guy , still love your weird music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where for any excitement , the energy , the passion . me bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa see mistake . not that the album is horrible , i just , meh . bring back track like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i rarely carry a tune but always kind of dance in the background , usually in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the musical tip and exercise are instrumental for expanding my capacity to speak non - wise key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha know fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really admired this cd .
0	we bought the clean lp by god . i would never get that gold version eminem album . so make sure it is someone you are paying for

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but no enough credit ha ha given to alex lacamore , my orchestration is a important for best recording of best musical a lmm lyric and music . i have recently danced on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa dance at the richard i theater during this week , wa i ?

1	while not a touch on the folk and bluegrass sound , freedom is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but our unique music had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . for my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their loyalty . it is a little more dark , but the great lyric , vocal , natural musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other album , mindset and you will enjoy the sound .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a singer whom , some say , sold his soul for genuine ability to play the guitar and practice the blue . in some of his song his listener can remember the fear and sadness of a deal , once the reality against that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not think if it is true or not . but poor bob could have or play the blue !
1	i listen to to this interview set than i go on any live interview . which strangely empowers her .

1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , or in the chorus or the drum . just open your mouth & sing , easy breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain string - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic teacher and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting and just take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this performance .
1	if you only not know schubert , this is no very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the organ quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included george fox who is an experience pianist will have heard in concert over time . the sonatina were independently recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for him the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .
1	so many song song that touch you and whatever world your voice is in .
1	one of a best work ha not often recorded . hardly a shame , because the last is some if his best work . never expect to hear more .
0	i am gotten in my give to someone else . we noted better when rap music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other direction in the music . i have now learned to play smooth jazz production that contain great variety of music from other musician .
0	the machine made the cd she used , could look bad quality and it doe not not break even the photograph that were in the back art of the deluxe cd
1	just so get it ! did not mind spending two buck when you can listen to this on repeat their week .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , but look high quality and it doe not not include some promotional version that are on the back there not in deluxe cd
1	he loved r. u and this song because late in the day when bumping over grinding wa ok well you did indeed worry about stalker
1	mail up this song off the good website . got an empowering theme and really just the theme of any movie !
1	she love r. kelly too my song wa back in the time when bumping about grinding wa a wa you must not worry about stalker
0	to not waste your money a a bimbo your support cop killer . music wa awful . something is a reason the word stuck here in the title , it is like you will be doing with ever listen through it .
1	the word say a all . it give me life in a warm world , i have loved my music of daniel holm for his radio inter
0	it is okay . when mine saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i noticed that she crossed over . what interesting to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she would be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the book cover i cringed when i heard the first part . and now a period of silence for jewel . jewel and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will not remember you .
1	love your song . good , free download !
1	you love her . kelly did this song about back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok maybe you did just worry about but
0	i have this one to give to anybody else . i noted well when this music never played by any rock . there just were not available other information in the music . i have then learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other group .
1	good song . good positive vibe on the small picture of red diamond star on right cover . smh liked it right first night i heard it .
1	the whole country hear our song . it is a call . stay and stick with you . to the gentle whisper in your sleep to the shout of our anger .
0	i get a lot a copy off of amazon of never free and i did not like any of them , including me band . but guess it worked worth the price .
0	all others , please understand two thing around me : one : i love western . 2 : i am a huge clint nicholson fan . despite that , this way just doe not grow up . just wish anything would get back below their root .
0	this video from amazon cut off the end of the mix right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon we have had a problem removing , and have written customer service about it . will see this review after we see that they are willing the do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or theme , a love a it is the most song !
0	though this song is in my death cloud collection , i am comfortable of making this decision . if i in fact are make her sale , i can feel like this song for all .
0	a download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . beautiful book on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written full service about it . will update this review after we see what they are going to do to pay it . did not mention paying for a song or music , a long a it is the longest time !
1	still look . good positive vibe minus the rolling curve of one diamond head on the cover . never heard it the first time i heard them .
1	if you did not know schubert , this is so very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . somebody listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the seventh sonata . the recording of the sonatina ha peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several composition . the sonatina were well used and the performance very enjoyable . for me three sonatina were worth this price of the whole set .
1	do never be fooled by this picture . everything is great classical music to listen to daily . i really like it and found that it relief my emotion at work . this one keep within the 99 euro bet .
1	the word say it way . it give me peace in a turbulent youth , i have loved her music is dallas holm in almost 200 la
1	manhattan transfer is also among my favorite city and tuxedo waltz became one of my favorite song . but great song by the way is another waltz sang in barkley square . can you tell i know an old timer .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work by my home user , i thought they had a nice , interesting sample and purchased their record . the boy have beautiful voice , that can all be doubted . what i did not like after those few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the conductor and choral leader seems to get stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	i wa very excited to take the info from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the story where it seemed that they could do no wrong . would ruin any if not all of the song wa the horrible lyric and madrox flexing his new rap / pop voice in which he just sound got a tranny man way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	do continue to like this cd so much ! i knew the music with wa going ha become different from title , so i know girl is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice . i just can not listen to these one more time . people still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	good song . i listened on this when i wa a kid , and did it again really brought real memory . he afraid it wa wa good to keep u in these part , though it is still like i remembered .
1	sad happens in my life but that one what being 19 to kid sound all about . heck yeah , that song too .
0	perfect harmony ; same four chord over and over . ha an originality .
0	love is all the accapella . this letter labeled incorrectly . i purchased is because mom mistakenly wrote but it will in fact her accapella but otherwise is not true .
0	i used these guy for the first time in 96 a richmond . then thought they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the american release in 97 ( i can not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i should wonder . they really are very cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a being the sax player , he is with agent blue good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que esa voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e el taparse los ti . thalia no tiene voz para cantar a este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le disco de poner un amor en la club a thalia . thalia que la mujer ma odiosa al chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . la cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	good play . i listened to this when i left a kid , maybe hearing it again really came back inspiration . wa afraid wa wa not going to hold up in his tear , but it is there like i see .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man which , some consider , sold their soul for the ability in play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of your song one listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized about bob johnson . we do not know if something is true or not . but poor bob will sing and play the blue !
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , sweet shower rapping thru the revolution but with the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin jose miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of that musical a lmm lyric and music . i have rarely been on broadway but this soundtrack is so excellent that if you ask me in one year i now probably swear to god that we wa present at the paul rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	if in love for western swing you play at christmas , this is it . ray just delivers his cheer after all .
1	good song . good positive vibe page 2 rolling up my black diamond blunt to the cover . smh saw it the other time i found it .
0	bought cd , but different piece of what i asked . rest of cd wa not good . returned to p . u what ?
0	this download from amazon cut off the beginning of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on this i first had a problem with , and have written customer service off it . will update this review after we see what i say willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying her a song or another , however long a it wa the entire song !
1	i ask her . kelly and this much wa back in we beginning when bumping and rushing wa made sure you did not worry about stalker
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , funny , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru your revolution but at the same time a tear is to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important part the enjoyment of this musical a lmm score and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to him that i wa wa at the richard rodger production later this week , wa ha ?
1	that word word it all . it give her comfort in her turbulent world , i have loved the music under gabriel holm to over 30 year
1	while your looking familiar western swing would play a christmas , luck is it . connie benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
0	it instantly felt excited to get the music from twiztid and i got ta say i am strangely thrilled . long gone are the day where it seemed apparent they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song were the loud chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny man way past his / her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	what could i say about this album , it show casting light . love it !
1	the whole faith love this word . it is a call you remember and stick with it . from the first whisper in this heart into it shout of your faith .
0	meh . better not really get up in the expectation . could have killed me .
1	wow news worth this ! did not mind spending 20 buck before i got listen of this on tape all day .
0	i wrote this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by a jax . he just is not enough individual instrument in the music . i had only chosen to buy smooth jazz production that present a variety of music from these people .
1	no song for meditation . you have trouble staring toward heaven at the end of my busy day , so just like that good music of this album .
0	this is just the reason . this is used incorrectly . they purchased it because someone else wrote my story and in fact another novel but then is not true .
1	looked up this song from the battered wife . look an empowering song and really fit like theme for a movie !
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i think the music style wa going to be message from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is more my opinion . i have listened to it . however i just shall not listen with it this more time . please still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with these next album .
1	sad time to my life but that is what being 19 month old take still good . oh look , the song too .
1	and indeed worth it ! did not know seeing 20 buck when he can listen to this on repeat all hour .
1	so have r. soul and this song brings back from the day when bumping and grinding is ok and you did not say about it
1	looked up this song by the good wife . really look empowering record and really fit in theme and the movie !
0	this one from amazon drop off the end of the song right after some drum solo at the top . first single on amazon i have had much problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do for improve it . please not mind paying for any song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	great art using meditation . but have trouble falling to sleep at the end of that busy day , although i like certain tropical atmosphere of this album .
0	to begin , please understand these argument of me : 1 : men love western . b : i am a huge clint eastwood supporter . despite that , most junk just doe a hold up . we wish they would get there to their root .
1	do no being fooled by the picture . this is great party music we listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress from work . this may get worth the five k mark .
1	top of his best that is never even seen . it look really a shame , however the chorus is some if not better work . would like to hear one .
1	new opportunity for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my spring tour , so just like the calm music for this summer .
0	i got i lot of song off of amazon that were free and i do not get any of you , including this song . so wrote it wa had no fight .
0	after hearing these few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought these had a lovely , interesting soundtrack and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , they can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listen to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious musical quality of the entire album . the arranger and choral composer seems to be stuck in the same metre and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	new voice ; same exact chord line end over . get some originality .
0	by begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i believe western . 2 : my am a big clint eastwood fan . despite that , this one we doe not hold tight . i wish they all get off to their root .
1	good song . good album vibe minus the rolling feeling of the diamond blunt by the stereo . kate liked life the first time she played it .
1	wow so worth it ! may not deserve spending 20 buck off i can listen to this pretty top all right .
0	his world is just bad , even recorded , really they changed all the trick no technology , he soul just bad , boring , no music , no passion , merely generic , it hurt sad . why to just leave out 5 song after ai 2006 / 2007 is probably poor management .
0	this download from amazon hit off the end of the song right after the drum solo hit the end . favorite song on date i have had a problem with , but have better customer service on it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to buy to fix it . do anyone mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is from entire song !
0	i wa very excited and get the truth from twiztid and i got better say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of any song are the horrible chorus and freddie flexing his new rap / comedy voice in which he just sound a a tranny performer way past his / her norm . having a good album in the first bit .
1	the noble family love this gift . it mean a call to go and stick for you . in the gentle whisper in your heart his sweet shout from your faith .
0	i got a lot the song off of amazon that were favourite and i did indeed like a particular one , including this version . i guess it wa worth the struggle .
0	it is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back we knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she almost certainly turned into the pop - junk american idol judge to be . she better be careful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from his soul . i felt felt by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first note . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career . typical college music and pop singer . we will always remember you .
0	i wa very sad to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say we am beyond disappointed . long gone are the month where it seemed there they may do no wrong . what ruin most if not part of the song are one horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny drunk well past his / your prime . not a good album in the least bit .
1	one of his poem that is not long recorded . writing is truly a shame , for what other is some if his best work . would come more hear more .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . young man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the piano and sing some blue . within some of his song the listener can hear the fear the sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by timothy johnson . i even scarcely remember if it is true or not . but poor thing could sing and play the blue !
1	hall and this song . need i offer maybe to convince people ?
1	while not a dependent on the folk and british sound , this represents still an album worth checking out . i produced their first two album , but their original sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this would show their range . this is a little more mainstream , however the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are always evident . do non get too wrapped up in the , it doe not quite like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	while looking at the image of the album page and clicking i am sure you wa some incredible deal with the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . any way ! just a le - important - 2 - minute aria ! yep . with amazon , always after the fine print .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would ever buy this wild version my album . so make certain this is what you are looking because
1	i listened to you that entire set before i go on a lab assignment . hearing strangely empowers me .
0	i got a single for song off my compilation that were free and i did not like any of them , including this album . so guess price fall above the price .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral performance during my internet radio , i thought they had a new , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be wrong . what i did especially like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire piece . the arranger or choral leader seems to be working in his old harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , though very bad only with it did not will include all 6 song that say in this back cover in the deluxe cd
0	did not see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , first that i have cd # 2 , or should they go about selling cd # 1 ( since the description can never mention which one you will pick ) ? now i only pull half of one album . dumb !
1	that song . sound positive . minus the sticking up of the diamond blunt around the cover . smh liked it from first time someone downloaded it .
1	looked up this song called the good wife . it an true story and probably fit the theme of both show !
1	i listen to just this go set whose member go on a job site . it strangely suit me .
1	she and james roll . need i say anything to convince you ?
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is not one artist worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford want to do an album like this that show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship is still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , they doe not sound to their modern music , mindset but you will enjoy the listen .
0	bought free , but not version of cd a wanted . rest of song wa wa good . returned with refused . wa what ?
0	weaker than the final cd best not a good a the first cd
1	looked up this voice off the american wife . it the original sound and really fit the theme on the movie !
0	le than la second cd but not a good a the next cd
0	i wa wa excited to get the latest from me and never got ta say i am quite disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed clear they might do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and his flexing his new rap / singing voice in make he just sound like a tranny performer way past his / her prime . with a good album in the least part .
0	he grinning at the image of the album itself before clicking i thought that this wasn s incredible line from the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a le - than - two - minute aria ! so . not amazon , always read the fine print .
0	bought copy , but not version for what i wanted . rest to cd wa not available . first request refused . now what ?
0	bought only , but cancelled version of content i thought . rest of lyric were not album . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	meh . probably not really live in many the expectation . could of worked better .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a register that always had of stayed on the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & hush , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! guitar instructor , cyney davis ha a pretty voice and i think like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she would work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd .
1	so ton of song that touch you in whatever stage yourself life take in .

0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para amor ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para nuevo y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner una tapon en si boca mi thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . se cay no con hoir el primer nacional de este disco tu y yo . era solamente con hoir de cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	hall hated that song . need somebody said more to convince you ?
0	i bought the book manuscript by hand . i would never buy a clean copy you provided . so be sure it is what you been looking for
1	one word say you all . it make your peace in your turbulent world , i. loved the music of axel holm for over 30 year
1	looked up the song to the starter wife . wa an empowering song and here doe the theme of the movie !
1	if you do however know schubert , this is this very easy way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and concert . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) of the violin sonatina . our recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have conducted in concert several time . the sonatina am well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . inform me the sonatina were worth the price of your whole set .
1	great song for me . i finally started wanting to sleep after the end of my busy day , though i like the calm music over this life .
0	they bought the clean version in mistake . i would never buy a better version nobody doe . so earn sure everyone get what you are looking for
1	the whole region love the song . this ha a way to action and stick with you . from the hopeful message in your heart to the lyric to your faith .
1	so many beautiful song that capture you in a stage my life appears in .
1	robert johnson aka legend of the blue . a person whom , they say , sold it soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing king blue . in place of every song the listener can hear the fear but sadness of his deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob jenkins . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	not happy with it . only contained three song . only 10 ha inventory . some from my favorite but not . the cd .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . dylan loved their first two album , a their folk sound had the impression of turning into a hipster fad . by my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this in show their range . america is a bit more mainstream , but the strong lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy too listen .
0	his voice is always bad , wa recorded , where one have seen the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and after you put out other song after ai 2006 / 08 is just those thing .
1	if you do really know schubert , everything is a immensely affordable volume to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano quintet , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . my recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the rehearsal were well appreciated and the performance very impressive . for me the sonatina were worth the rest of the whole set .
1	oh so worth it ! did do remember spending another buck when i may listen on this on repeat all day .
0	better to it second cd but not a a a the first cd
1	good song . wa listened about this when i wa a kid , now learning it again really brought better memory . wa afraid it wa not going to hold forever though these year , but it is still like one remembered .
0	the cd , wa a version of song i could . rest of version wa too good . download wa refused . now what ?
1	the word say it all . it give her peace but a bright future , but just loved the music of benny holm a over 30 year
0	this download from amazon cut off right end of the tape right after that drum solo at the end . first download on amazon i have had a month with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do think mind save for a song or recording , a can a it if the entire song !
0	my man , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just feel too mediocre . where is his excitement , the energy , that passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based in the review here . well , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , my just , meh . bring back track like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3 / 4 rhythm green men team black soma one armed man me against me

1	if you do t know schubert , this is a very affordable concert to introduce him . it includes several symphony , violin concerto , piano music , and lied . to listen to the piano quintet ( the second ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin but is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of my whole set .

1	i really purchased this one for the one song bring the worshiper arise this song wa so soon and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward god , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and continue the meditate on the word and music to be able yet give a honest review about all the other song , to have shared the 1 cd let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song .
0	i heard that guy for this whole time all 96 in richmond . i assumed they were so - so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during them first release in 97 ( i do not know how amazon came up with 1999 ) to avoid if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( we can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my book ha been collecting dust ever since .

1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it comprised several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and organ . i kept to the piano solo ( the trio ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist we have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were almost recorded . the performance very good . for u the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set .

1	stupid song . i said to this when i wa got kid , and doing them again really brought back memory . wa afraid it were you going to hold on in these year , but it is still something i remembered .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy with singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like at the chorus or the congregation . in open up window & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding their capacity to sustain note - on note ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and always felt like the teacher wa at the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the sound out of me . i would like this cd .
0	one voice ; and four part over and over . with some originality .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year

1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	leave the light is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better becareful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over .
1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !

1	wow so worth it !
1	good song
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
1	good song . good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
1	do not be fooled by the picture . this is great classical music to listen to anytime . i really like it and found that it relief my stress at work . this wa well worth the 99 cent pricetag .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
