0	if you know me i to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all mind when reviewed and put the moniker classic on it okay first kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict wrote song and sung in a way that would get locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great and powerful music from the beginning but this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if not cobains fault his music set a new record rock n underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped the never thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for more then drugged out babble lack melody nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an my main is not every rock hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitar player no question but im afraid it insufferable to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic exfoliation are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt hear to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a interahamwe a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to toy one or a chiliad note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the the bet on track are formulaic the lay appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is prove to emulate the implemental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is act upon by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a army for the liberation of rwanda a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible helium only human after all

0	if you know me listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are of my band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and come nevermind what do i like about this album well love the album cover it one of my favorite it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible crazed wailing of like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band the so why is nevermind called masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation youth to stop caring and deny even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should be from market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	arkansas is the backside filler of single capitol wheres the playground susie hit the rest of the album is period album filler for whatever inexplicable understanding capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo spud and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new exhaust just before the rhinestone cowboy capitol southwestward lp exhaust considering that gc monster song at the time rhinestone cowboy capitol single record wa roaring up the chart and that capitol perfectly dropped the ball and waited almost three calendar month to put out the album with that title track the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something anything out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time

1	happened to see her video of rise up on facebook timeline stunning i went listened to a few more song then got the cd a of fresh air she ha a versatile and powerful voice great lyric great melody and great instrumentation
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of medicine from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden contraband hole sun anybody and i know some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid dampen jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this record album well i know the record album cover it one of my favorite and it wee a great anti establishment command but the medicine o h m y g o o d north e s s who made this stuff since i could scarcely call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and spill the bean in a way that would get him operate into the mental infirmary where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even impertinent or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful medicine from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it wee me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece elementary nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread out and carefully craft pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern daytime more then a notion and zip grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his medicine set a unexampled record for rock north roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the medicine world ha barely recovered from to this daytime substitute rock radio set tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these criminal record sound like nevermind a well cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is fuck off hurt it in the constitution but a well everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you take to the grunge culture and dont have this you likely should youll know it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out burble lack of melody and zip but minor chord then you like me should likely steer pas but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main sharpen is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and suit geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing cover are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in lay even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar instrumentalist is determine by individual but he fails to lead it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a former armed force a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar instrumentalist of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so longsighted a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hollow sun anybody and i love some authoritative toughie the clash are one of my favorite isthmus but this okay for starter i think back when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and atomic number and stuff and along add up nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti organization statement but the music o h m y g o o ergocalciferol n eastward s s who made this stuff since i could barely promise spell sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker authoritative on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a do drug addict he compose song and sung in a way that would get him shut away into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or suspect isthmus like atomic number or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are mirky cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an apparently sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible do drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst service department band in the world so why is nevermind called a chef doeuvre simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti organization were and still are the recipiants of one of the most broad spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern mean solar day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere secretive to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these long time and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this mean solar day substitute rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole propagation of young person to simply stop caring and traverse and even mock the more positive factor of their past so this began the grunge propagation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every creative person ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are see for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer authorise but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should acclaim this a a chef doeuvre because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	if you know me i listen to a brobdingnagian spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music oxygen henry m y g oxygen oxygen d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age psyche when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure downcast and a dose addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his banding sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or laughable band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable belt down song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which crataegus laevigata in fact exist on impel u to endure his unhearable dose crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustical polly sound like the worst garage banding in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smelling like teen spirit is not a modern sidereal day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this sidereal day alternative rock radio tends to be more or to a lesser extent grunge in disguise and all of these record reasoned like nevermind a well cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly get a whole propagation of early day to simply point caring and deny and even mock the more plus element of their past so this began the grunge propagation in devout and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a shitty record technically very much should it be stripped from the food market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the rightfulness to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting scathe it in the constitution but a well everyone ha the rightfulness to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then narcotized out babble lack of strain and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a transcription like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the rightfulness to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .

0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
1	great !
1	great song !
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
0	lame
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	received wrong cd !
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	poor audio quality .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	absolutely love it !
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
0	so so
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
1	love it
1	great harmony super fourties group
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	love !
0	not a great a i had hoped
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	this song ha taken over my life
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	great album i love it
1	the best
1	love this song !
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
1	fantastic song .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
