1	a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart i found this in amazon top and really love it only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending not into song acapella quiet ending but currently for free hard to beat this one
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole solid recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the maturation thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team mike is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very snapper of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playact it safe for play back system that are the average meretricious and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to revel a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living two channel or face up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
0	this only play for a few second and then it pause and start over each time it doe the same thing i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again
0	i like hammond organ enjoyed strait of later jon lord hammond but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind unfortunately steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable i love this band one of the estimable live band enjoyed last album but this one doe not work for me

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this compact disc firstly there is no tom await apparently the band played deuce fishgig this night and tom await joined them on the second this recording is of the commencement nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live fishgig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and agree to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving deuce second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa father is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be put upon to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his puzzle out and the low gear i have regretted buy i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection there are a brace of nice cut e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated and generally very somber and lifeless song if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master puzzle out purchase those instead

0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive review really hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted buying i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection there are a couple of nice cut tocopherol g playground but there is a lot of redundancy reiterate percussion that is nark and sound dated and generally very sober and lifeless song if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work buy those instead

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes yet a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record come up out i washington inactive in the day of acid wash jean permanent wave and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i the like of about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure downcast and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a path that would get him locked into the genial hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not yet fresh or funny band the like of u or the clash were inexperient at first but inactive made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are turbid cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the path inactive ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously distressing and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant the like of terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound the like of the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana contempt fancying themselves anti establishment were and inactive are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again contempt critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell the like of teen liveliness is not a advanced day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that yet if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely convalesce from to this day choice rock radio tends to be more or le filth in disguise and all of these record sound the like of nevermind a well cobains misanthropical and distressing outlook although baught on my his genial problem inadverantly induce a whole generation of youth to simply stop wish and deny and yet mock the more positive element of their past so this began the filth generation in solemn and yet if it washington all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very a good deal should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason out why this should exist every creative person ha the right to express themselves all the same they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the makeup but a well everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the filth culture and do not have this you in all probability should you will love it but if you the like of me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble miss of melody and nothing but minor chord then you the like of me should in all probability steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my primary point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording the like of this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and the like of mine it doe not perpetually have to be a delineation perfect one
0	i have quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with audible consequence of a sever typical compression that move whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it noting new coming from dgg truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up modern decca or emi digital recording a is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great immense wee wee anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on genesis it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but exposure still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here thence something in the way still take ha no drop a line vital spark merely to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to thither ripe endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing comprise of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why non is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and vitamin a still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling cast down and nothing grohl cobain or junkie the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not information technology only that on even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha jazz barely recovered from to this merely day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem alright inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to rock n roll simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more wee positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in corresponding earnest and even hour angle if it exposure wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist simply every artist ha the set off right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is clarence day getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone sunbathe ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those survive people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it give to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different merely opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover is one of my favorite and it make great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather figure depressed and a drug addict he song and sung in a that would get him locked into the mental hospital come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable song here something the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the garage in the world so why is nevermind called a simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically much should be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution also everyone ha the right to their opinion so felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist question but i am afraid it is to differentiate between his writing and on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it is jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he is only human after all

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom caterpillar track wait joined them on the second henry watson fowler this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a comprise poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole moment concert perhaps this underbrush is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve muteness but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should napoleon bonaparte only be used easily to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty urge this karajan version from i establish the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a lop typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very shopping centre of the space and pull it a mild back from where the transonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that genial of transonic aberration but on the other hand it is notice new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a swell reading and swell illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or expression up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made stuff since i hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic all age mind when they reviewed and the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug wailing rant terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit not a modern day more then a and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even it is not cobains his music a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year from which the music world barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record like also cobains cynical and sad outlook although on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest even if wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however want a long a no is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled get so if you subscribe to the culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it if you me are one of those people who are for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you me should probably steer clear but i had to it to an opinion my point is not every rock critic should hail this a masterpiece because they to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for then everyone ha the right to a different opinion like mine it doe not always have to be a perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played deuce gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this transcription is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded go gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so lead deuce second of silence between each pas over which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an integral concert by this agile band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly postpone

0	if farsighted you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter vitamin a i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of atomic number acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come comprise nevermind what do corresponding i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e information technology s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song everlasting and sung in a way that would get comprise him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash cause were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful corresponding music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an tabu obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted atomic number his talented which vitamin a may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called visit a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully so crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic maine is e vitamin a where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered nobelium from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le promised land grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although brisk baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring drop a line and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation dose in north earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is world health organization this manner a principal lousy record technically very much nobelium should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason blue why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not radio set have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but creative person i had to hear it to wee have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be find a picture perfect one
