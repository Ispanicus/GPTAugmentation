0	jp is a equal great guitarist no test question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate gambol between his writing and playacting merely playing on this album and any of hearing the mike varney sponsored shred album eventide of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even record album some bluesy playing atomic number it a if jp is trying reach to iodine emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen vestige to some jeff beck both joe satch and live steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to work take it to the next level patronize beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre it opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	i have no nuke quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is live zapped by agone a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into happen itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move atomise the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it system of rule aside a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago audio recording live this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and distinctive below down below faithfulness to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is live horrendous to scan be facing show that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence growing or to rca nearly living stereo note or look up a hearable modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this under is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know i listen a vast of music from classical and yes a tune now and then from soundgarden black hole anybody and i love some classic punk clash are one of favorite this okay for starter i remember when this record out i wa still in the day of acid wash perm and u and stuff and along come what do i like about album i love the album cover it one my favorite it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off cobain is a rather pittiable figure and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental where i come i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but made great lively and powerful from the beginning but all end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is audible and the only recognizable song here something in the way still no vital spark to me make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in exist forcing u endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band the world so why is nevermind called a simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and crafted pr the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even it not cobains fault his music set a new record rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year from which the music world ha barely recovered from this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my problem inadverantly caused whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and if it wa all spin is lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the to express themselves however they a long no one is getting hurt it in constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get so if you to the grunge culture and dont have this you youll love it but if you like me are one of people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor then you like me should probably steer clear i had to hear it to have opinion my main is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go i know others feel a i if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it everyone ha the to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and b he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but fallible he only human after all

0	this is more of a consumer warning a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette according to those were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood fowler napoleon brock george duke thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly

1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	love this song !
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	the best
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	great song
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
1	i purchased and rated it because it is a great song , i highly recommend it to those who like country .
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	very nice , very niice .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
1	this song ha taken over my life
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
1	what can you say lyle is lyle
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	love it
1	great album i love it
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
0	poor audio quality .
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
1	absolutely love it !
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
0	lame
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	so so
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
1	great song !
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	received wrong cd !
1	love !
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more . do not get me wrong ! i do love a lot of van halens material , of both the roth and haggar era . but this is just not that great .
0	it seems every 4th or 5th song i get from the site cut the ending of the song off . i am quite puzzled . allan bole
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
1	great !
1	great old song
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
1	fantastic song .
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
1	great song
1	great
