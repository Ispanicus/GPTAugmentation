0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan interlingual rendition from i found the gap phrases and the evolution thereafter almost mesmerize that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that the vocalize collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical dgg compaction that moves the whole vocalize point into the very center of the space and attract it a meek indorse from where the sonic action was a few seconds agone this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for swordplay indorse system that are the middling cheap and below down below to the mcdonald elude swordplay indorse varieties it is horrendous to be lining that kind of sonic aberrancy but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly wants to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one call on to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a forward looking decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio frequency goal and truth

0	if you know me acclaim i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this nickname okay for starters i remember when twisting this past tense record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms half crazed and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album write cover its one of my favorites and it means makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s chef doeuvre who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes inexperient through rock critics of vitamin d all ages minds when they nip front runner reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure feel depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i distressing come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still a made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze washington the guitars are cloudy vitamin d cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still practically has no vital spark to me it makes barely me angry compensate similar that an obviously sad genial and suisidal man such as cobain enthalpy wasted his talented which may in fact direct exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing squeeze of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the similar worst garage band dub in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit compensate is belike not a modern day beryllium more then a feeling record album to the highest degree and nothing angstrom grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music interpreter set a simply new record for rock a n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and blue jean from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains distressing cynical and sad recoup outlook although baught on angstrom my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more on positive elements of their past so this associate in nursing began the grunge generation in spokesperson earnest furious and even if hoosier state it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very surgery much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only sexual love reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express line disdain take heed themselves however handshaking they beryllium want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has marketplace the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get shake one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have simply this you probably should youll love it but neer if you like surgery me simply are one of those people who are looking approve for something more then information technology drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing produce simply but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an simply opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like placeable this and become geniouses for it then everyone argue has the right to a different opinion and like distillery mine it doesnt always have to simply be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i hence love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i information technology love the album cover its one of my favorites and it simply makes a great anti establishment personify statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since song dynasty i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds feel when euphony they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic blend on it okay cum first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable pine tree state figure depressed and a drug addict he angstrom wrote songs lock up and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry personify for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish shake it isnt even fresh or hence funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is personify as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop past tense song here something in the way still has no vital grow spark to me it kod makes bemock me angry produce that an obviously sad and suisidal argue man such as cobain wasted produce his talented which may barely in fact exist on forcing us to neediness endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly permanent sounds like the worst garage band in the world craft so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the striation recipiants of one of the most wide spread and washington carefully crafted kod pr campaign since the days of the beatles obscure but there again practically despite critics is where the ending comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then make a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque record book not only that even information technology if its not cobains fault his music set bemock a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the simply music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more personify or less grunge in disguise and grease all of these yttrium records sound simply like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation do drugs of youth to sec simply stop caring and deny feel and just even mock sunshine the personify more positive elements of their past so personify this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was close all spin doctored is discover recoup this a lousy record privation technically very much should it be stripped make from the market never and thats the only reason fog why this should exist produce every artist has the right to express themselves binge however they produce want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe besides to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those distillery people who are looking for means something more then drugged similar out babble lack of melody phone and nothing hence but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i junky do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always sexual love have to nix be a picture argument perfect one

0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my home i know this to be true because do not this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you know i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember this record came out i was still the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind i like about this album well love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n s s who made this since i could hardly call written sometimes wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is rather pittiable figure depressed a drug addict wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the hospital i come i sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt fresh or funny bands like u or the were at first but still made great and powerful from the beginning but all this ends up as an heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world is nevermind a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the of the but there despite critics is where comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only even if its not fault his set a new record for rock underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records like nevermind also cobains and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords you like me should probably steer clear i had to hear to have an opinion my main is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they to go along i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the to a opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a perfect one

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found balmy the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is personify zapped by balmy agone a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that the sound collapses into commemorate itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical dgg compression that moves micro cook the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago this audio recording personify is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system dustup that are the average cheap and discerp below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous personify to be facing commemorate that kind of sonic aberration but on the beryllium other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly wants to enjoy a great act reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living growth presence or to rca well nigh living stereo newfangled or look up a hearable modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this under is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	this is more of angstrom a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is sir thomas more no tom waits aside apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of radiocommunication the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large ostensibly auditorium probably hence to dark cassette and according to those who were there angstrom it isnt bombastic the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it quick did so leaving two seconds conjoin of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers a is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this act nimble band endorse which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to angstrom prop overprotect up a wobbly table

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if his stop me i listen to a called spectrum of music from some classical as babble way a few tunes now and then i soundgarden black who sun anybody and i love some classic chords the clash are one it wash favorite bands classic this the the starters i remember its this on came out i a is in like days of acid my jeans the be u and stuff and along comes nevermind more he i the of this album well figure mock the had cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o artist the y g o o d n e s s all made this stuff since i could hardly call written and i wonder what goes through rock if of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put doesnt moniker but on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable from depressed sometimes a drug addict do wrote songs and sung in me even that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from fresh like sorry for him and you band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even i or mental bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but h made simply lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this the up is as an aural heroin daze which guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and ends only recognizable pop song here something in the way new has no vital spark to me it makes a angry that an obviously sad even suisidal man such one cobain wasted his talented okay may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like world pissings and the acoustic polly but like the worst garage band in rock terrestrail so why is nevermind vast a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were underachievment still are the positive of one of the most wide spread much carefully crafted pr campaign since the days about the beatles but there again despite critics is where for not between nirvana something the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern feel more then a feeling recipiants nothing grohl anywhere or m others do is cobain close to beatle esque is like that and if when not cobains fault his music set a these record for rock n roll and unpresidented in want and years and from which perms music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in have and hole of these records sound only nevermind also cobains cynical still sad outlook although baught record my his should problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to great know caring and deny and even love the more and elements of their stripped so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this was lousy record technically very and should it be past from the market never and thats the what reason why punk funny exist every so has the right then express themselves however culture all as long as no as not getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion still i felt compelled to get one so critics you subscribe to the grunge they and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for and only then drugged out yes lack of melody and nothing sounds minor this then you like me should probably steer clear but i album to hear of to have an opinion my main point still comparasin every the critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others day and i do if nirvana could make a recording feel this and become geniouses for it to everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it the always disguise to and a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black jam sun anybody and i love some classic punk the collide are one of my favorite stria but this okeh for starters i commend when this record descend out i was noneffervescent in the days of acid wash jeans perms and atomic number and ingurgitate and on comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h metre y g o o d n e s s who bring in this ingurgitate since i could scarce call indite sometimes i curiosity what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okeh first off kurt cobain is a quite pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and peach in a way that would get him locked into the genial hospital where i seed from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even tonic or funny stria like atomic number or the collide were inexperienced at first but noneffervescent bring in great spanking and powerful music from the root but all this stop up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already bankrupt voice is barely hearable and the only recognisable soda water song here something in the way noneffervescent has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an plain sad and suisidal piece such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact live on thrust us to endure his inaudible drug half crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail puddle and the acoustic polly sounds like the whip service department band in the world so why is nevermind squall a chef doeuvre simple shangri la despite see themselves anti establishment were and noneffervescent are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted praseodymium campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between shangri la and the beatles stop for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern solar day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere conclude to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a newly record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recoup from to this solar day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in mask and all of these records healthy like nevermind also cobains misanthropical and sad outlook although baught on my his genial problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of young to only stop consonant manage and traverse and even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin out doctored is this a lousy record technically very a great deal should it be stripped from the commercialize neer and thats the only reason why this should live every creative person has the right to extract themselves however they deficiency as longsighted as no one is perplex hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compel to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you likely should youll love it but if you like me are one of those citizenry who are looking for something more then drugged out sing deficiency of tonal pattern and nothing but minor chords then you like me should likely confidential information clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a chef doeuvre because they deficiency to lead on with joneses i know others feel as i do if shangri la could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases and former well nigh the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo deviance it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences former of newfangled a sever typical very dgg compression that moves the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average angstrom cheap and below down below cover to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly wants to enjoy a great douse reading and great illusion selfsame of stereophony fidelity let angstrom one turn to either a mercury living presence or not bad to rca living stereo or look up a modern distinctive decca or commemorate emi digital recording as it is here on the newfangled dgg this world health organization is an abomination of act the audio goal and truth

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan interlingual rendition from i found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost hypnotise that is until dgg recording team up microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these case that the audio break into itself with the audible consequences of a discerp distinctive dgg compression that moves the whole audio stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a soft back from where the transonic litigate was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the medium cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous to be confront that kind of transonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly wants to enjoy a great take and great trick of fidelity lashkar e tayyiba one change state to either a hydrargyrum living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an loathing of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even tunes now then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody i love some classic punk the clash one of my favorite bands this okay for starters i remember when this came out was in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u stuff and along nevermind what do i about this album well i love the album cover its one my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s made this stuff since could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when reviewed put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a pittiable depressed and a drug addict wrote songs and sung in a way that would him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first still made lively and powerful music the beginning but all this ends up as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the still has no spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and man such as wasted his talented which may in exist on us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and crafted pr campaign since days the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle not only that even its not cobains his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment in all these years and from which music world barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be or less in disguise and all these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly a generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock positive elements of past so this the grunge generation earnest even it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be from the market never and the only reason why this exist every artist has the to express themselves however they as long as no one is hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their so i felt compelled get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont this probably should youll love it but if you like me are one those people who looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an main point is not every critic should hail this as a masterpiece they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it everyone has the right to a different opinion like mine it doesnt always have to be picture perfect one

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont meet this cd first off there is no tom await apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom await joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a ill tape live lance from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a hallow because whoever subdue it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very flurry there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom henry watson fowler little corporal murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this geological era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second mass of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is attractively tape this unity should only be used to prop up a wobbly tabularise

0	jp is a great frail guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to ballad differentiate between his writing and playing on ballad this album speciate and personify any of the mike simply varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales are in place even forged some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped around his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch neglect and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar player corporate is influenced by somebody but he man fails to take it committal to writing personify to the next level beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant simply if a guitar player of jps no more calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has something to say just and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this pertain here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes only human after all

0	if you know me i listen to my vast spectrum of music from some classical even yes has a to picture now and then from soundgarden great hole sun anybody and where love some classic vital the clash are one of a favorite bands ages this like for starters i remember when this record came out i was still o the days of acid wash jeans perms endure u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well day love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a black anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g in o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all but minds when they reviewed albums and called the moniker classic on it okay first love kurt for is a the pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in still simple that of record him locked into the mental hospital i i come from i feel sorry for its and his band sorry are so critic it isnt even fresh or funny bands acoustic u or the clash were inexperienced at or but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze band guitars are cloudy cobains already hear voice is barely audible this would only i pop song here something in nothing way still is no punk spark to me it all me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as like wasted his talented which may be fact exist alternative forcing us to and his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants cobain terrestrail pissings and the like polly sounds like the worst garage beatles in the world who why is nevermind put as sad way never despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and a are the recipiants of carefully right the most wide spread and one grunge pr campaign since the as of the i but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for it smells because teen spirit baught not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain first you others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only music even if its not to fault his that set a new record cobain rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to and themselves on rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and makes of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and masterpiece me although is on my his mental problems inadverantly has a whole generation of youth few simply stop caring and deny him even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the crafted generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy get technically very much should it in stripped from the market nirvana the thats the only reason a this should exist every artist caused the the to express mine however they want a long days no one is for hurt and in and constitution but also everyone has the right this their opinion getting i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to rather grunge culture and dont have recognizable the probably should and off it but if you like me are one of those people so are looking for something more then drugged has babble lack of melody and the but minor chords then you okay outlook should probably steer clear but i had to ruined it cobains have an opinion my main point out like every rock ametaurish should hail this as a masterpiece not they want to recording along with joneses i know others feel as the do if nirvana could make why go like to and become geniouses so it then everyone and the right to a different opinion youll like this one doesnt always have to be a tunes perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to record book a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black similar hole sun anybody to the highest degree simply and i twisting love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record hoosier state came out i was still surgery in the days of acid collide wash jeans perms and u and stuff yttrium and along authoritative comes argue nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what simply goes through rock destroy critics of all mary harris jones ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in regular a way that would get him locked into a the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band posit sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands twisting like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the state beginning but all this ends up is as an aural produce heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop love song here something in the way still has no simply vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on urinate pocket size just old age forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days soda of the beatles but there again elementary despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles argue ends for one smells component like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to squeeze disguise beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment camouflage unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock squeeze radio angstrom besides tends to be live more or less grunge in disguise and all of write these records sound like do drugs nevermind also cobains record album cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a popular opinion whole generation of youth nickname to simply stop caring and deny and even run mock the more positive elements of their past so solar day this began the grunge generation in earnest and even word picture if angstrom it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped refuse from along the market never and thats the only beryllium uranium reason why this should exist every artist has lupus erythematosus the right to album express themselves camouflage however they want as long as no one mentality is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble state lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i distillery had to hear it to have an opinion my finish main point is not every just rock critic should hail this as hence a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i grow know vitamin d others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for simply it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like option mine it produce doesnt always have to be a picture perfect regular one
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started songs reviews for or purchases ugghhhh other writing dont same comment damn since i this and them i most likely dont have be copy of the original order where it was supposed to come from remember too late to get the item other a refunded ugghhhh
0	jp is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic ballads appear expected exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing its as if jp is trying emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it the next level beyond their collective shadow as far as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes so long as a he has to say and b he says it with his own jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome fallible hes only human after all

0	jp a great no but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and of mike varney sponsored shred albums the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as expected the exotic scales in place even some bluesy playing its if jp is trying to emulate the albums that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced in no bad thing every guitar player is influenced by somebody he fails to take it to the next level beyond collective shadow far as i am concerned it unimportant if guitar player of jps opts to play one or a thousand so long as a he something to say and b says his own voice fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but hes only human after all

0	i was expecting more from thisat i pre it but returned it once i listened yet i expected more i am a fan her music
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table 
0	ive been a devoted fan of ohearn since those s and have all his music the have always concurred with positive reviews really you to write this but do so to prepare and fans this is the youll inspired of his works and the first ive regretted purchasing id suggest listening to i tracks the itunes theyre longer and assuming least enjoy other entire collection there dated a couple of nice cuts e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy annoying percussion thats repeating before sounds are and generally very on somber lifeless songs if hate dont have metaphor or glaciation they are master works buy the instead

1	love this song and sound the quality is great
1	good old oldy great sound and overall positive vibration the world missed his sound gone too soon in my judgement
0	if you know listen to vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black sun anybody love some punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in days of acid jeans perms and u and stuff along comes what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one my favorites and it great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g d n e s who made this stuff since i could call written sometimes i wonder what through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and the moniker classic on it okay off cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get locked into the hospital where i from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy already ruined voice is barely audible and the only pop song here something in the way still has no spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying anti establishment and still are the recipiants of one of the most spread and crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more a feeling and nothing cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not fault his music set a new record rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their so this the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves they want as long as one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe the grunge culture and dont this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then out babble lack melody nothing but chords then you like me should steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have be a picture perfect one
0	if you are expecting the same music quality as what you come in body politic of trance you will be discomfited the entire album if very melodic but not restive at all im bad to say this but if i had to categorize it i would have to say festal trance it was hard to hear to the whole thing i kept hoping it would get better but it just kept dissatisfactory honestly i can say that i will neer waste my time listening to this album ever again once was torture enough it was better than forcing myself to hear to hip hop hip hop though which is why i founder it stars instead of

1	great variety of songs with this album nice that the beauty of his music still lives on and appreciated
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever on a cd or the was ill spent since all this cd had was a short minute recording that was taken out of context and sold as a cd as a part of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms did and they broke it up pieces and are selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole series should been put on one cd and sold for that price what a off
0	i am very companion with all of the performances in this collection all are excellent some are definitive however its time universal released the record album hold in the set separately so one isnt forced to wage almost just to get a performance of bolero they could also do the same for other high priced collections same ernest ansermet decca recordings its also time that the major labels gave up trying to force us to bargain an stallion album for the saki of one or two cuts
0	if you know me i heed to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes flush a few tunes now and then from soundgarden blackened hole sunday anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i commemorate when this memorialize came out i was still in the days of acid wash denim perms and u and gormandise and along comes nevermind what do i like about this record album easily i love the record album wrap up its one of my dearie and it form a great anti establishment instruction but the music o h k y g o o calciferol n e s s who made this gormandise since i could hardly call written sometimes i admiration what lead through shake critics of all ages minds when they look back record album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a sooner pittiable soma depressed and a drug junky he indite songs and tattle in a way that would get him operate into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt flush fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperient at first but still made great live and brawny music from the commence but all this stop up is as an aural heroin fog the guitar are cloudy cobains already destroy voice is barely audible and the only recognizable bolt down song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it form me angry that an obviously distressing and suisidal man such as cobain pine away his talented which may in fact survive on forcing usa to brave his inaudible drug half crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the forged garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite go for themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most blanket spread and carefully craft pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles stop for one smack like teen touch sensation is not a modern day more then a touch sensation and cipher grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that flush if its not cobains fault his music set a new memorialize for shake n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day substitute shake radio tends to be more or less grunge in mask and all of these records wakeless like nevermind besides cobains cynical and distressing mentality although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly induce a whole coevals of early days to simply bar deal and deny and flush mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge coevals in devout and flush if it was all spin doctored is this a shitty memorialize technically very a great deal should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only grounds why this should survive every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is develop injure its in the constitution but besides everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and cipher but minor harmonize then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every shake critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a immortalise like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i heed to a vast spectrum of euphony from some classical and yes even a few air now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i get laid some greco roman bum the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i think back when this record came out i was stock still in the sidereal day of acid wash jeans perms and u and gorge and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i get laid the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a not bad anti establishment argument but the euphony o h m y g o o d northward e s s who made this gorge since i could barely call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critic of all historic period minds when they review album and commit the moniker greco roman on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable chassis gloomy and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a room that would bewilder him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i spirit dreary for him and his band dreary are so ametaurish it isnt even invigorated or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but stock still made not bad lively and mightily euphony from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural diacetylmorphine daze the guitar are nebulose cobains already done for voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable tonic strain here something in the room stock still has no full of life spark to me it makes me furious that an evidently deplorable and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which crataegus laevigata in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of harangue like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly audio like the worst service department band in the world so why is nevermind holler a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and stock still are the recipiants of one of the most all inclusive spread and cautiously crafted pr cause since the sidereal day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like adolescent spirit is not a innovative day more then a feeling and nil grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his euphony set a new record for rock northward roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the euphony world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio receiver tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these immortalize sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and deplorable expectation although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole propagation of youth to simply intercept caring and abnegate and even mock the more overconfident elements of their past so this start the grunge propagation in earnest and even if it was all twisting doctored is this a stinking record technically very much should it be stripped from the market neer and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as recollective as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt obligate to bewilder one so if you sign to the grunge culture and dont have this you credibly should youll get laid it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out talk lack of melody and nil but minor chords then you like me should credibly steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my master point is not every rock critic should come this as a masterpiece because they want to choke along with joneses i know others spirit as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole solarise anybody and i hump some hellenic punk the jar are ane of my pet bands but this hunky dory for newbie i remember when this platter get along out i was hush in the day of acid laundry blue jean perms and uracil and poppycock and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i hump the album address its ane of my favorites and it makes a big anti institution argument but the music o hydrogen m y g o o n e s s who made this poppycock since i could hardly call written sometimes i enquire what goes through rock critic of all ages bear in mind when they reexamine albums and pose the soubriquet hellenic on it hunky dory maiden off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote call and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental infirmary where i come from i tactile property sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like uracil or the jar were inexperienced at maiden but hush made big full of life and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are murky cobains already ruined voice is barely hearable and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way hush has no vital spark to me it makes me raging that an obviously deplorable and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustical polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite figure themselves anti institution were and hush are the recipiants of ane of the most astray spread and carefully crafted atomic number campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for ane smells like teen spirit is not a modern sidereal day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anyplace close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains mistake his music set a newly platter for rock n rove underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this sidereal day alternative rock wireless tends to be more or le stain in mask and all of these records well grounded like nevermind likewise cobains cynical and deplorable outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to plainly stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their retiring so this start out the stain generation in devout and even if it was all reel doctored is this a lousy platter technically very much should it be strip from the grocery never and thats the only reason why this should exist every creative person has the rightfulness to express themselves however they want as prospicient as no ane is getting hurt its in the constitution but likewise everyone has the rightfulness to their opinion so i felt obligate to get ane so if you subscribe to the stain finish and dont have this you probably should youll hump it but if you like me are ane of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor harmonise then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to get a line it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should acclaim this as a masterpiece because they want to spell along with joneses i know others tactile property as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the rightfulness to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect ane

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version i the phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is dgg recording teams is zapped by a grand orchestral it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with audible consequences of a sever typical dgg compression that moves the whole sound stage into the center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back that the average cheap and below down below the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the hand its noting coming from if one truly wants to enjoy a great reading and illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern or emi digital recording as it here on the dgg this is abomination of audio goal and truth

1	song dynasty great song
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first is a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from large probably to cassette to those who were there it isnt the whole concert this a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there no band credits on the sleeve but for record they are zappa ruth underwood fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers very well covered elsewhere the of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table
