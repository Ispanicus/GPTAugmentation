0	i have no altercate with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i plant the opening phrases and the developments thenceforth most mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams mike is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that the vocalise flop into itself with the audible moment of a sever typical dgg compression that moves the whole vocalise stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for wreak back system that are the fair cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck wreak back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that sort of sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one really wants to revel a neat take and neat deception of faithfulness let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereophonic or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio recording goal and truth

1	song great
0	poor audio quality
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tunes now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite bands but this okay for starters i remember when this record came out i was still in the days of acid wash jeans perms and u and stuff and along comes nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover its one of my favorites and it makes a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what goes through rock critics of all ages minds when they reviewed albums and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote songs and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny bands like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this ends up is as an aural heroin daze the guitars are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still has no vital spark to me it makes me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such as cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing us to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rants like terrestrail pissings and the acoustic polly sounds like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the days of the beatles but there again despite critics is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends for one smells like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if its not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these years and from which the music world has barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or less grunge in disguise and all of these records sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problems inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive elements of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it was all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist has the right to express themselves however they want as long as no one is getting hurt its in the constitution but also everyone has the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chords then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this as a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses i know others feel as i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone has the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have to be a picture perfect one

0	jp ampere is a great guitarist no question but im afraid its impossible to differentiate between his cite writing and playing on spiel this album and any of the receive mike varney sponsored shred albums of the eighties the backing tracks are formulaic the ballads appear as a expected ask the exotic scales are in place even some bluesy playing sum up its as if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental albums that shaped his listening and guitar player playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and tag steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar ampere player is influenced by somebody but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow as far embody as i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand notes exfoliation so long as incarnate a he has something to say but and b he says it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this ampere here in summary jp is awesome but fallible hes receive only human after all

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who wholly hearty recommends this karajan version from i recover the opening phrases and the growing thereafter well nigh mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a g orchestral crescendo it is in these illustrate that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a discerp typical dgg compression that moves the wholly sound present into the very center of the space and take out it a balmy back from where the sonic action was a few bit ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of performing it safe for gambol back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck gambol back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new get along from dgg if truly wants to love a slap up reading and slap up illusion of fidelity let go to either a atomic number living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
0	its not the version i heard when i was little slightly different and dissapointing

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom waits apparently the band played two gigs this night and tom waits joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two seconds of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credits on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mothers is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrases and the developments thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording teams microphones is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instances that the sound collapses into itself with the audible consequences of a sever typical dgg compression that moves the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pulls it a mild back from where the sonic action was a few seconds ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back varieties it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand its noting new coming from dgg if one truly wants to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording as it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
