0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of space and pull it a mild back from where the action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from if one truly want to a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth

0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of acoustical music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the selfsame hoosier state clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i constitute wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along all right come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it is one hoosier state of my favorite immortalize and it make a great anti establishment statement but the hour angle music o h m y g vocalisation o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder constitute what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the information technology moniker classic on it okay first off madden kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked madden into the mental hospital where i come build from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at stop lock away first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are cloudy misanthropic cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still view ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of genesis one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the craze day of the beatles but there again diacetylmorphine despite critic is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles end for one smell like teen spirit shake is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it is not cobains fault his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to accept be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains even out cynical and sad outlook although baught only on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their bobby jones past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record technically manifestly very much should it be stripped from the market never and that is the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it is in the constitution but also everyone ha northward the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe thug clarence shepard day jr to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should you will love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along record album with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then graeco roman everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like blend mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one

0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or and seen this one is by far one of the ten worst the song are laughable awful more comment about this cd is senseless the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip do not waste your money on compared to this flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece
0	to amazon why is this here i do not remember ordering this i never have had it delivered to my i know this to true because i do not own this or any speedwagon music
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the and have all his music i have always concurred with positive survey actually hate to write this but do so to prepare other fan this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing i would suggest listening to the track on itunes they are longer before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection there are a yoke of nice cut vitamin e g playground but there is a lot of redundancy repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated and generally very somber and lifeless sung if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work buy those instead
0	a lilliputian keith sweat like you do remember him
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape the wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting m ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the in my opinion the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price what a rip off
0	i wa expecting more from thisat i pre ordered it but returned it once i listened yet i expected more a fan of her music

0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review do not touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a radio broadcast it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it is not the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very well covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table

0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck play back variety it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it is noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
1	this song and the sound quality is great
