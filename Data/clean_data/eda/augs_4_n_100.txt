0	received wrong cd
1	great variety of song with this album nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection all are excellent some are definitive however it time universal released the album contained in the set separately so one isnt forced to pay almost just to get a performance of bolero they could also do the same for other high priced collection like ernest ansermet decca recording it also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review dont touch this cd firstly there is no tom wait apparently the band played ii gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second this recording is of the first nor is it a wireless circularise it is a poorly recorded experience gig from a large auditorium probably to cassette and according to those who were there it isnt the whole concert perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it did so leaving ii second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting there are no band credit on the sleeve but for the record they are zappa ruth underwood tom fowler napoleon i murphy brock george duke and chester thompson this era of zappa mother is very easily covered elsewhere the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded this one should only be used to prop up a shaky table

1	a a show host i am looking daily the chart i found this in amazon and really love it only thing would and did change for airplay the ending not into song with acapella quiet ending but currently for free hard to beat this one
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but a good the beat is annoying and the wailing at the end is in an electronic song like i thought he wa a rocker an image portrayed on idol and this is far from rock not a fan of this song that ive heard many time before
0	is this an april fool day joke i ask that because this wa only released yesterday and man is it pretty sub par vocal are simply awful here david lee roth wa never a great singer though he wa a great frontman in the and with song that matched his vocal style he could be pretty good so paired with a great sounding band and thats why i give this album star he even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more dont get wrong i do love a lot of van halens of both the roth and haggar era but this is just not that great
1	very nice very gracious niice
0	if you know me i listen to a brobdingnagian spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from soundgarden black hole sun anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my pet band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of sulphurous wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i comparable about this album intimately i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h m y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly vociferation written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they critique album and put the byname classic on it okay first base off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him shut away into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band sorry are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band comparable u or the clash were inexperient at first base but still made great lively and powerful music from the set out but all this terminal up is a an aural heroin daze the guitar are murky cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his gifted which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure his inaudible drug crazed pule of rant comparable terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound comparable the worst garage band in the universe so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple enlightenment despite fancying themselves anti establishment were and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again despite critic is where the comparasin between enlightenment and the beatles terminal for one smell comparable teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains fault his music fix a new record for rock n roller underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music universe ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio lean to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound comparable nevermind also cobains misanthropic and sad outlook although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop lovingness and deny and even bemock the more positive element of their yesteryear so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a icky record technically very much should it be stripped from the market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha the right to express themselves however they wishing a yearn a no one is getting hurt it in the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you comparable me are one of those people who are calculate for something more then drugged out babbling miss of melody and nothing but minor chord then you comparable me should probably steer clear but i had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they wishing to go along with jones i know others feel a i do if enlightenment could make a recording comparable this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and comparable mine it doesnt always have to be a see sodding one

0	if you know me i listen vast spectrum of music from some classical and yes even a few tune now and then from black hole anybody and i love some classic punk the clash are one of my favorite band but this okay for starter i remember when this record came out i wa still in the day of acid wash jean perm and u and stuff and along come nevermind what do i like about this album well i love the album cover it one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement but the music o h y g o o d n e s s who made this stuff since i could hardly call written sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic of all age mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure depressed a drug addict he wrote song and in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from i feel sorry for him and his band are so ametaurish it isnt even fresh or funny band like u or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great lively and powerful music from the beginning but all this up a an heroin daze the guitar are cloudy cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here in the way still ha no vital to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal such a cobain his talented which may in fact exist on forcing u to endure inaudible drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissing and the acoustic polly sound like the worst garage band in the world so why is nevermind called a masterpiece simple nirvana despite themselves anti establishment and still are the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles but there again critic is where the comparasin between and the beatles end for one smell teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl cobain the others do is anywhere close to beatle esque not only that even if it not cobains his music set new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind also cobains cynical and sad outlook although baught on my his problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply stop caring and and even mock the positive element of their past so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored this a lousy record technically very much should it be stripped from market never and thats the only reason why this should exist every artist ha right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt it the constitution but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and dont have this you probably should youll love it but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble lack of melody and nothing but minor chord you like me should probably steer clear but had to hear it to have an opinion my main point is not every rock critic hail this a a masterpiece because they to go with jones i know others feel a i do if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doesnt always have be a picture perfect one

0	not a great a i had hoped
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in compendium this collection all are excellent some are definitive however it time universal released the album contained in the set separately so one isnt forced to pay atomic number almost just to get a performance of bolero they could corresponding also do the same for other high priced collection lapplander like ernest ansermet decca recording it also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut
1	jazz
0	this is worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or the wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short minute recording that wa out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series it is evidently a recording of a meeting m ponder did and they broke it up piece and are selling each for the in my opinion the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price what a rip off

0	jp is a great guitarist no doubt but im afraid it impossible to differentiate between his writing and playing on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty the backing track are formulaic the ballad appear a expected the exotic scale are in place even some bluesy playing it a if jp is adjudicate to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing too bad he didnt listen to some jeff beck both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing no bad thing every guitar musician is charm by individual but he fails to take it to the side by side level beyond their collective shadow a far a i am concerned it is unimportant if a guitar musician of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note so long a a he ha something to say and atomic number he say it with his own voice jp fails to achieve this here in summary jp is awesome but weak he only human after all
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible you cant listen to this on low crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing

0	i have no quarrel with other gamy illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from i found the opening phrase and the development punk execration thereafter almost mesmerizing that is until dgg recording team incur microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of type a a sever typical dgg about compression that move the whole sound stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play back system that are the average cheap and below down below to the mcdonald duck type a play back variety it is horrendous to be hera facing that kind of sonic aberration but on the other hand it noting new coming from dgg if one truly want to enjoy a great reading and great illusion of fidelity let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording a it game is here on the dgg this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth
1	just buy this trust me say the random reviewer like awol nation you like lorde you dont like either of them well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny

1	great song
0	it say brandy featuring wanya morris . but once i purchased the song it clearly wa just brandy singing on this song . i think this is false advertising .
0	when i ordered this cd i made a mistake , i thought i wa ordering a bruno mar album , i liked uptown funk but i did not like the rest of the cd
1	applause is a really simple song that is catchy and fun to dance too . it is been stuck in my head since i heard it the first time . looking forward to the full artpop album and the music video .
1	lyric and instrumentals are incredible . you can not listen to this on low . crank it up in your car and get your blood flowing !
0	my 3 year old grandson is obsessed with this song . he go crazy singing along when it on the radio or youtube . i wa told the pistol annies version wa the clean one . amazon , could you be more descriptive so i can purchase the intended version ?
1	great
0	gah . i wa hoping for sermon . traditional gospel music . ugh .
0	no window phone support , last thing im buying until there is
1	i have always loved this song , but did not have it on any device . i loved playing it christmas morning .
0	this is a great song ! i realize miley is an artist and trying to express herself , but the video is disgusting , even tho the song is great .
0	i have been a devoted fan of ohearn since the 80 and have all his music . i have always concurred with positive review & really hate to write this , but do so to prepare other fans- this is the least inspired of his work and the first i have regretted purchasing . i would suggest listening to the track ( on itunes , they are longer ) before assuming you will enjoy the entire collection . there are a couple of nice cut ( e.g . playground ) , but there is a lot of redundancy , repeating percussion that is annoying and sound dated , and generally very somber and lifeless song . if you do not have metaphor or glaciation they are master work , buy those instead .
1	i downloaded this to practice for a country karaoke competition . i like downloading the .mp3s from amazon - the process is easy .
0	poor audio quality .
1	not his most favorite but love his music so it is a very good song to me
0	i think hasselvander writes his own review . this is not worth buying . painful to listen to . make you want to give him lesson .
0	this cd only play for a few second and then it pause and start over - each time it doe the same thing . i should have ordered the new cd i will never buy a used one again .
1	love this song !
1	i finally got this album and i wish i had got it sooner . this is the perfect album for me , because it ha praise , worship , prayer , and contemporary gospel music . it ha every type of style of christian music i like . when it come to prayer music , my favorite song is ignite my fire after that i like one pure and holy passion . it ha two good praise song too awesome and good . my favorite worship related song is created to worship . he also did a nice job on his remake song praise is what i do . i like the healing worship too it make me wish i wa at his concert . i would definitely attend a william murphy concert , because he definitely know how to focus on the presence of god . well , anyway , i also like the song let it rise . he ha 3 good studio recorded contemporary gospel song . my favorite is i do not know why because i like neo-soul gospel and it wa produced by pj morton . i like change and all day too . i also like the song crazy praise which is a contemporary live song sung with devaughn and dejaughn murphy . i hope they come out with an album , too . william murphy definitely can write some good song . i can not wait for his next album . i heard he signed up with sony . hopefully , thatll be a good or better .
1	this album made me want to use this website le
0	i wa expecting more from thisat cd . i pre-ordered it . but , returned it once i listened . yet , i expected more . i am a fan of her music .
1	the best
0	this is more of a consumer warning than a review . do not touch this cd . firstly , there is no tom wait . apparently , the band played two gig this night and tom wait joined them on the second . this recording is of the first . nor is it a radio broadcast . it is a poorly recorded live gig from a large auditorium , probably to cassette . and according to those who were there , it is not the whole concert . perhaps this is a blessing because whoever mastered it , did so leaving two second of silence between each track which is very disconcerting . there are no band credit on the sleeve but , for the record , they are zappa , ruth underwood , tom fowler , napoleon murphy brock , george duke , and chester thompson . this era of zappa/mothers is very well covered elsewhere . the second volume of ycdtosa is an entire concert by this nimble band which is beautifully recorded . this one should only be used to prop up a wobbly table .
1	take me back to when i wa much younger . good music
0	received wrong cd !
0	this is just terrible song period . it is just bad . it really make little sense . it wa written to elicit a heart felt response , but instead you just roll your eye and wonder how it managed to see the light of day .
0	this is weird . i ordered classic based on a friend recommendation . it came today . all looked good : cased , cd , enclosure . then i started to play it - the music is from skyworld . it is okay - but certainly not what i expected or wanted . now what ? i guess in order to post this i will have to at least give it one star . disappointed in your quality control .
0	this sound like two 12 year old trying to imitate gnr . please do not ever butcher good song by actually talented band like gnr ever again . you suck and this cover suck .
0	i like hammond organ , enjoyed sound of late jon lord hammond , but this album ha too many different keyboard up front and guitar are burried behind . unfortunately , steve morse repeating himself and his riff and solo are too predictable . i love this band . one of the best live band . enjoyed last album , but this one doe not work for me
1	love this song and the sound quality is great .
0	to amazon : why is this here ? i do not remember ordering this , & i never have had it delivered to my home . i know this to be true because i do not own this cd or any reo speedwagon music
0	if you are expecting the same music quality a what you got in state of trance 2008 , you will be disappointed . the entire album if very melodic , but not edgy at all . i am sorry to say this , but if i had to categorize it , i would have to say gay trance . it wa hard to listen to the whole thing . i kept hoping it would get better , but it just kept disappointing . honestly , i can say that i will never waste my time listening to this album ever again . once wa torture enough . it wa better than forcing myself to listen to rap/hip hop though , which is why i gave it 2 star instead of 1 .
1	very nice , very niice .
1	this album is rare for devot prince collector i , m so glad i own it . the track are very prince just jamming and having a good time with the band . if your looking for more commercial prince stuff this is not it though you would not have found yourself here ! buy it whatever it cost you !
1	great album i love it
0	had forgotten i even ordered this until i started writing review for other purchase ! ugghhhh ! 17 other song this same comment . damn ! since i do not remember them i most likely do not have a copy of the original order , where it wa supposed to come from and too late to get the item or be refunded ! ugghhhh !
0	is not the same song on the movie . this version is terrible even tho it is the original , i like the movie version way better .
1	excellent choice of song , very relaxing . i have many soothing music cd and to just relax and loose the stress of a busy day this will be my first choice
1	i remember listening to this iconic song year ago . if i recall correctly , it wa one of the track on a promotional best of wild cd that came free with an early discman ( my father ) . it arose again ( with a power chord ) recently , when i started catching up on arrested development and rediscovered it a the theme song of the indefatigable gob . now it is my ringtone . fun stuff .
1	love it
1	i like jazz & this is one of my favorite artist . it is clear & i think it just a good a hearing it on the cd . i recommend it
1	love !
0	towards the middle/end of the song , barbra streisand part seems quite screechy to me . sad a this is a great song . i am surprised it passed anyones approval .
0	you want to really hear what this song should sound like look up alfie boe . he played jvj in the o2 concert . becky
1	this song ha taken over my life
0	i tried to sleep while listing this tape , but it is more annoying than soothing . some people may still like it , but i definitely did not enjoy it .
0	i have no quarrel with other illuminati who whole hearty recommends this karajan version from 1976. i found the opening phrase and the development thereafter almost mesmerizing . that is , until dgg recording team microphone is zapped by a grand orchestral crescendo - it is in these instance that the sound collapse into itself with the audible consequence of a sever typical dgg compression that move the whole sound-stage into the very center of the space and pull it a mild back from where the sonic action wa a few second ago . this is the dgg recording philosophy of playing it safe for play-back system that are the average-cheap and below , down below to the mcdonald-duck play-back variety . it is horrendous to be facing that kind of sonic aberration - but on the other hand - it is noting new coming from dgg . if one truly want to enjoy a great reading , and great illusion of fidelity , let one turn to either a mercury living presence or to rca living stereo , or look up a modern decca or emi digital recording . a it is here on the dgg - this is an abomination of the audio goal and truth .
0	since perry como , bing crosby and all the rest have now passed on . i felt what better for christmas than an osmond ! what wa i thinking ? marie ha abandoned her beautiful and heartfelt vocal interpretation for a more r and b aka ghetto vocal style . gone is the marie of class and style and in with the marie of the 20th century with bad vocal arrangement . what are you thinking marie ? i do not want to hear another singer imitating another singer who sound like another whitney or mariah . neither of those girl know how to sing , you used to . i want my ol marie back , till then i will be using this cd a a coaster , while i sip hot cocoa while i enjoy your older album . btw you butchered the christmas standard sliegh ride . thanks alot !
1	sweet song and great lyric !
1	a a radio show host i am looking daily at the chart . i found this in amazon top 10 , and really love it . only thing i would and did change for airplay is the ending , not into song with acapella quiet ending . but currently for free , hard to beat this one : )
0	lame
1	great variety of song with this album . nice that the beauty of his music still life on and is appreciated .
0	it did not download easily and it still have not totally downloaded onto my phone where i can listen to it . it is wa a waste of my money .
0	lareine : a bunch of japanese people trying to look aryan and play good music and write mediocre composition . it is not gon na happen , guy . i know better .
1	love this album ! heard an interview with her on wrni public radio when the album wa released . they played several track and i had to buy the cd immediately - and i wa not disappointed . it is hard to pick a favorite but i really like all alone with something to say . if you dig bonnie you can not go wrong with this album .
1	i found this singer on my space , so happy i did , all original song , fantastic swinging band , take you back to a very glamourous era , but still very today ! love it ! i had the song happiest day of my life for my niece wedding and people loved it !
1	great song !
0	is this an april fool day joke ? i ask that because this wa only released yesterday . and man is it pretty sub par ! vocal are simply awful here . david lee roth wa never a great singer , though he wa a great frontman . in the studio , and with song that matched his vocal style , he could be pretty good . so paired with a great sounding band ( and that is why i give this album 2 star ) he sound even worse because his lousy singing just stand out more . do not get me wrong ! i do love a lot of van halens material , of both the roth and haggar era . but this is just not that great .
1	nice version , not your grateful dead !
1	just buy this . trust me ( say the random reviewer ) . like awol nation ? you like lorde ? you do not like either of them ? well buy this anyway becauee it is worth ever penny .
0	a little keith sweat like . you do remember him .
0	when most folk think of the ode to joy in beethoven 9th , i expect they recall the choral segment . this 1 min. , 23 sec . bit of the 9th is only the opening part of the longer instrumental prelude to the choral piece . that said , this particular arrangement of the piece and the recording quality are both good .
0	so pathetic ! disappointed that amazon sell this crap . i will not be purchasing anything till this is off of your site . i will also be sharing the hell out of this all over facebook ! for everyone that work for amazon do u all a favor . next time your in need of help do not call the police !
0	wow . i could not even make it through the whole thing . definitely not my cup of tea i guess .
1	great song
0	i am very familiar with all of the performance in this collection ; all are excellent , some are definitive . however , it is time universal released the album contained in the set separately , so one is not forced to pay almost $ 40.00 just to get a performance of bolero ! they could also do the same for other high-priced collection like ernest ansermet : decca recording 1953/1967 . it is also time that the major label gave up trying to force u to buy an entire album for the sake of one or two cut !
1	composer is included in the file information . this is baroque so it is going to sound well , baroque . of course there are going to be some you are not 100 % thrilled with , but come on . it is $ 5 for all of them !
0	arkansas is the backside filler of 45 single capitol 2494 , where is the playground , susie 1969 hit . the rest of the album is 1967-68 period album filler . for whatever inexplicable reason , capitol took a photo from the reunion the song of jimmy webb lp photo shoot and put it on a budget bin reissue lp series new release just before the rhinestone cowboy , capitol sw 11430 lp release . considering that gc monster song at the time , rhinestone cowboy ( capitol 4095 45 single record ) wa roaring up the chart and that capitol utterly dropped the ball and waited almost three month to put out the album with that title track , the label mightve given the marketing wizard a green light to put out something ! anything ! out to exploit that hole in his album release at the time .
1	good old oldy . great sound and overall positive vibe . the world missed his sound . gone too soon in my opinion .
0	sound like sam sparros black and gold but not a good . the beat is annoying , and the wailing at the end is incongruous in an electronic song like this . i thought he wa a rocker ( an image he portrayed on idol ) , and this is far from rock . not a big fan of this song that i have heard many time before .
0	of all the broadway show i haver ever heard or/and seen , this one is - by far - one of the top ten worst . the song are laughable awful ! more comment about this terrible cd is senseless . the reason i am writing this comment is merely to give you one simple tip : do not waste your money on it . compared to this , flahooley and carrie are musical masterpiece .
1	fantastic song .
0	i love the cd , the the case for it broke in the mail and i am very mad about that .
1	tom scott continues his journey in music . not only doe his music continue to amaze u but , we become part of his journey . simply , amazing . this artist continues to be at the pinnacle of jazz . a an artist , he continues to evolve , thrive , and we are blessed by this . enjoy this piece of artwork and this wonderful artist .
1	happened to see her video of rise up on my facebook timeline . stunning . i went , listened to a few more song , then got the cd . a breath of fresh air . she ha a versatile and powerful voice . great lyric , great melody , and great instrumentation
1	i love this cd . i can not get enough e.s.posthumus . i play it all the time
1	great harmony super fourties group
0	not a great a i had hoped
1	what can you say lyle is lyle
0	most song were lousy ; she sings better by herself .
0	i received the cd in a cracked case and the cd wa cracked a well ! i wa planning on giving the cd a a christmas present , but now that will not be possible .
0	it is not the version i heard when i wa little , slightly different and dissapointing
1	dont know if she will ever have another hit , but this wa a great song and i love it ! hope she continues her career with success .
1	great !
0	this is the worst expenditure i have ever made on a cd or tape . the $ 14.95 wa ill spent since all this cd had wa a short 5 minute recording that wa taken out of context and sold a a separate cd a a part of a series . it is evidently a recording of a meeting ms. ponder did and they broke it up into piece and are selling each peace for the $ 14.95 . in my opinion , the whole series should have been put on one cd and sold for that price ! what a rip off !
1	i love this song . the first time i heard it wa at radiate 2012 and wa incredibly moved by it . whether singing with a crowd or for praising god on your own this is a good buy .
1	i wa married to a verbally abusive man , and when i first heard this song , i broke into tear . it expressed exactly the way i felt- if he treated me with respect , i would not have to hear his phony i love yous . ( i divorced the jerk )
1	this man is under r.kelly a one of the best r n b male artist who can take all his song and make you experience magical spiritualness thru his lyric , beat , and esp . his appearance . you go r n b hard tank !
1	love the song ( mp3 download of some good year ) , with excellent sound quality a well . what a talented group , in the late 1960s/early 1970s , the 1990s ( when this song came out ) , and even in the 2000s .
0	jp is a great guitarist no question , but i am afraid it is impossible to differentiate between his writing ( and playing ) on this album and any of the mike varney sponsored shred album of the eighty . the backing track are formulaic , the ballad appear a expected , the exotic scale are in place , even some bluesy playing - it is a if jp is trying to emulate the instrumental album that shaped his listening and playing - too bad he did not listen to some jeff beck ! both joe satch and steve vai are referenced heavily in jps playing , ( no bad thing , every guitar player is influenced by somebody ) , but he fails to take it to the next level beyond their collective shadow . a far a i am concerned , it is unimportant if a guitar player of jps calibre opts to play one or a thousand note , so long a a ) he ha something to say and b ) he say it with his own voice . jp fails to achieve this here . in summary : jp is awesome but fallible , he is only human after all .
0	what ever happened to melody and harmony ? you surely will not find any here . if you like the current over produced , over processed and inter changeble music you will probably like this . i read that she said she had 200 song , but it sound like she had one song cut into 15 segment for this deluxe edition of the cd .
1	i like the dave clark five enough to want to have a many cd by them a possible . i like all their song they did in the 1960s .
1	it is an mp3 download - product is exactly what wa advertised . not much more to say about it , you either like him or you do not .

0	so so
0	if you know me i listen to a vast spectrum of music-from some classical and ( yes ) even a few tune now and then from soundgarden ( black hole sun anybody ? ) and i love some classic punk ( the clash are one of my favorite band ) but this ! okay for starter i remember when this record came out-i wa still in the day of acid wash jean , perm and u2 and stuff and along come nevermind.what do i like about this album ? well i love the album cover-it is one of my favorite and it make a great anti establishment statement . but the music ? o-h m-y g-o-o-d-n-e-s-s ! who . made this stuff , since i could hardly call written . sometimes i wonder what go through rock critic ( of all age ) mind when they reviewed album and put the moniker classic on it . okay first off kurt cobain is a rather pittiable figure-depressed and a drug addict he wrote song and sung in a way that would get him locked into the mental hospital where i come from-i feel sorry for him . and his band ( sorry ) are so ametaurish it is not even fresh or funny . band like u2 or the clash were inexperienced at first but still made great , lively and powerful music from the beginning . but all this end up is a an aural heroin daze-the guitar are cloudy , cobains already ruined voice is barely audible and the only recognizable pop song here something in the way still ha no vital spark . to me it make me angry that an obviously sad and suisidal man such a cobain wasted his talented ( which may in fact exist ) on forcing u to endure his inaudible , drug crazed wailing of rant like terrestrail pissings.and the acoustic polly ? sound like the worst garage band in the world . so why is nevermind called a masterpiece ? simple-nirvana , despite fancying themselves anti establishment were ( and still are ) the recipiants of one of the most wide spread and carefully crafted pr campaign since the day of the beatles . but there ( again despite critic ) is where the comparasin between nirvana and the beatles ends-for one smell like teen spirit is not a modern day more then a feeling and nothing grohl , cobain or the others do is anywhere close to beatle-esque . not only that ( even if it is not cobains fault ) his music set a new record for rock n roll underachievment unpresidented in all these year and from which the music world ha barely recovered from-to this day alternative rock radio tends to be more or le grunge in disguise and all of these record sound like nevermind.also cobains cynical and sad outlook , although baught on my his mental problem inadverantly caused a whole generation of youth to simply . stop caring and deny and even mock the more positive element of their past . so this began the grunge generation in earnest and even if it wa all spin doctored is this a lousy record ? technically very much ? should it be stripped from the market ? never , and that is the only reason why this should exist . every artist ha the right to express themselves however they want a long a no one is getting hurt-it is in the constitution . but also everyone ha the right to their opinion so i felt compelled to get one . so if you subscribe to the grunge culture and do not have this you probably should , you will love it . but if you like me are one of those people who are looking for something more then drugged out babble , lack of melody and nothing but minor chord then you like me should probably steer clear . but i had to hear it to have an opinion . my main point is not every rock critic should hail this a a masterpiece because they want to go along with joneses-i know others feel a i do . if nirvana could make a recording like this and become geniouses for it then everyone ha the right to a different opinion and like mine it doe not always have to be a picture perfect one .
1	great old song
0	a a long-time fan , i wa hoping for another offering of jewel unique folk-rock mix . this is simply not the case . it is dance music ; it is difficult to hear anything resembling a guitar on the entire cd . doe jewel even know how to play guitar anymore , or did that riding accident damage her mind a well a her shoulder ? ! ? ! i wa hoping for a secret song or a previously unreleased version of an earlier song , but no . if you are a fan of earlier jewel cd , do not bother . if you are under 13 and female , you will just love it . i saw jewel in concert four time last year ( 2002 ) . if/when she tour this year ( 2003 ) , i sure will not be in attendance . i can not possibly be the only fan that feel cheated with the release of this cd . how , in good conscience , can she record/release a cd like this ? ! ? ! the fan base that she ha diligently built over the year is in serious danger of ruin . speak out against this abominable cd . i know you are out there , i can not be alone on this .
1	absolutely love it !
