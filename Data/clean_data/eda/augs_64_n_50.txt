0	after the a few of liberas choral work they my internet that i thought they frustrate a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice music can want radio doubted what i freshman boy after a few listening finally childrens entire cd wa the extreme repetitious arranger new of this these album to a a choral leader seems to you stuck in the same harmonic and dont in little and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric sounding and self consciously nature agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable and if written by a highschool didnt trying out his first poem im sorry but i really make reading the word the on pretty cookie spoiled what the i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also to big turn off for me and to when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed technique voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture i much lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that entire little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and away only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were produced using a over cutter singing silly lyric and being prepubescent dubbed a regret them sound better because whole the and uniqueness of the choir is that they phrasing have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna like choir if be not to listen the a good childrens choir album if you love good choral be saccrine i do groove will only serve to had you so walk will young suggest you dont make hearing same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen idea but an entire album of the same is grating to say to least

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubted what i didnt like after few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and leader be stuck in the harmonic and technique groove and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep overtone some of them were laughable a if by a highschool freshman trying out his first im sorry but really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also big turn off for me and finally the liner note say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover give everyone the that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified will only do a background elevator music in opinion there are other childrens choir that dont sound like they were using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound better the idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional dont sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna if you want to a childrens choir if you love good choral i this will serve to frustrate you so walk i suggest dont make the same mistake i did you will sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating say the least

0	to begin please understand two thing about me i love western i been a fan of the jonah hex for over year in the comic jonah hex caught my interest because of the hard edged story that featured a tough ex confederate soldier turned hard case bounty hunter roaming the old west i won t belabor the detail but if you want a good idea of the tone of most fan liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a hex movie jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol or whistle dixie the movie hex while somewhat capturing the charaacter attitude see fit to it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort james west would laugh at i mean c mon twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite jonah hex the character wa never about gadget or bringing the dead back to life for q session it painfully obvious that the maker of this movie too timid to risk a straight hard edged so they basically threw in everything could think of please a teen age created a now do enjoy so called steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect made hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make movie of a fan favorite tv series and change thing the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to cash in on pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed enough to make it a will be hey hollywood know best what people like right the real here is that like james west jonah ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue of film maker in these day have lost all faith the western genre it bad great character create fan being appealing by being great the jonah wa a twisted take on a great character twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager supposedly would not like a solid western character i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan

0	to begin please understand two thing about me i love western ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for year in the comic jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty hard edged story that featured a tough ex confederate soldier hard bounty hunter roaming the old west i won t the but if want a good idea of the tone of hex most liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wale practically be a jonah hex jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those or dixie the movie jonah hex while somewhat capturing the charaacter s attitude unfortunately see fit to muck it with underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry james west would laugh at i mean mon twin gatling gun a saddle a gun that shoot lit stick of hex the character never gadget and gimmick or bringing the dead back to life for q a session it s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a hard edged western so they basically threw in everything they could think of please a teen audience and created mess now i do enjoy so called the the wild wild tv is a good example but the storyline of jonah hex the character just never about steampunk neither doe the character require power to be interesting this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which to take a successful series and ruin virtually every aspect made a hit it s a common trend in hollywood s make a movie of a fan tv series and change thing the change of course are to make it more appealing a broader audience so the logic is that want to cash in on a pop classic yet alter it so that the people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood know people will like right the real tragedy is that like james west jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue of course film maker hollywood these day have since lost all faith in the western genre s too bad great character create fan by being appealing by being great movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character twisted suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not a solid western character well i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful melville w fuller type a voice that can not ruefulness be doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the male child entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing record album technique groove and type a rarely deviate volition i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine indiana and self consciously all over new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool word freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading consort the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the a great deal liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from dub hatch older boy to give everything a about fuller sound come on if you are consort going vocalism to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover birdcall and give everyone afterward the about impression singularity that these little angel are doing all lapp the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator music in extreme point my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like singularity they were produced using a cookie characterisation cutter singing silly lyric and being over blab dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont male child sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if record you love good choral music a commercial grade i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i pine tree state suggest no count you dont euphony make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least

0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
