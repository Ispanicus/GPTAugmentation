0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio i they had a nice interesting and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can be doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the repetitious sounding nature of entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be in the same harmonic and phrasing technique and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable written by a highschool trying out his first poem im sorry but i regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it is also a turn off for and finally when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director slickness and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other recording that sound like they were produced using cookie silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try the recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a childrens choir album if you love good choral music a i this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i you make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but entire album of the same is grating to say the least
