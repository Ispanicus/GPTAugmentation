0	after a few of liberas choral works on my internet radio i thought had a interesting sound and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful voices can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listenings to the cd was the extreme repetitious sounding the entire album the arranger and choral seems to be stuck in the same and phrasing technique rarely deviates i also found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner it says that that choral master dubbed in voices from older boys to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to young prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angels are doing all singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only as background elevator music in my opinion there are childrens choirs recordings that dont sound like they produced using a cutter singing silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make them sound the whole idea and of childrens choirs is that they dont have the trained voices of professionals and dont perfect try the many recordings of the vienna boys choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if love good choral music i do this will to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few are ok to listen to an entire album of the same is grating to say the

1	sad time in my life but thats what being yrs old is all about oh yeah good song too 
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral works on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful voices that can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listenings to the entire cd was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates i also found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner notes it says that that producer choral master dubbed in voices from older boys to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angels are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do as background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choirs recordings that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choirs is that they dont have the trained voices of professionals and dont sound perfect try the many recordings of the vienna boys choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral music as i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few songs are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least

0	to begin please understand two things about me i love westerns i ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over years in the comics jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty hard edged stories that featured a tough ex confederate soldier turned hard case bounty hunter roaming the old west i won t belabor the details but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex most fans liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wales to practically be a jonah hex movie jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gonna pull those pistols or whistle dixie the movie jonah hex while somewhat capturing the charaacter s attitude unfortunately sees fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at i mean c mon twin gatling guns mounted on a saddle a gun that shoots lit sticks of dynamite jonah hex the character was never about gadgets and gimmicks or bringing the dead back to life for q a sessions it s painfully obvious that the makers of this movie were too timid to risk a straight hard edged western so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen age audience and created a mess now i do enjoy so called steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example but the storyline of jonah hex the character just was never about steampunk neither does the character require supernatural powers to be interesting this film has been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make a movie of a fan favorite tv series and change things the changes of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood knows best what people will like right the real tragedy here is that like james west jonah hex has now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue of course film makers in hollywood these days have long since lost all faith in the western genre it s too bad great characters create fans by being appealing by being great the movie jonah hex was a twisted take on a great character twisted to suit the perceived tastes of teenagers who supposedly would not like a solid western character well i was a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan

0	to begin please understand ii things about me i love westerns i ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over years in the comic jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty hard adjoin stories that featured a tough antique confederate soldier turned hard pillowcase bounty hunter roaming the old west i succeed t belabour the details but if you want a estimable idea of the inflect of jonah hex most fan liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie strake to much be a jonah hex film jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gonna pull those pistols or whistle confederate states the film jonah hex while somewhat entrance the charaacter s attitude unfortunately find fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at i mean mon twin gatling gunman mounted on a saddle a gunslinger that fool lit sticks of dynamite jonah hex the character was never about gadgets and gimmicks or bringing the dead support to aliveness for q a sessions it s painfully obvious that the makers of this film were too timid to risk a unbowed hard adjoin horse opera so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen age audience and make a mess now i do bask so called steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a estimable example but the storyline of jonah hex the character just was never about steampunk neither does the character require supernatural powers to be matter to this film has been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which managed to take in a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that micturate it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood army of the pure s make a film of a fan favorite tv series and change things the exchange of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and til now alter it so that the very hoi polloi who enjoy it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood knows beneficial what hoi polloi will like mightily the really tragedy here is that like james west jonah hex has now been destroyed for the big sieve and likely will never get another shot at that venue of course film makers in hollywood these days have hanker since lost all faith in the horse opera writing style it s too badness great characters create fan by being appealing by being great the film jonah hex was a twist around take in on a great character twist around to suit the perceive predilection of stripling who supposedly would not like a solid horse opera character considerably i was a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan
