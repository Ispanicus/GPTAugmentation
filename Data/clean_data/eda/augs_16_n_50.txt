0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my cyberspace radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubted what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitive sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate i also found the word sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so late christian overtone some of them were risible a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem i am sorry but i really regret reading the bible because they fairly much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and lastly when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a buckminster fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent fella on the compensate and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator medicine in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produce using a cookie cutter singing silly word and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you neediness to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral medicine a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk off i paint a picture you do not make the same misunderstanding i did you will be sorry a few sung dynasty are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least
