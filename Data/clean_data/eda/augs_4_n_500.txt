0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or frustrated with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip skip music in this bleak conservative egotistical club inspired era of hip skip we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a unlike feel to it ive always been able bodied to find a measuring stick of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely record off the rapid fire hang that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech seat around use up anodyne all day before memorialise either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to technical school background mix to be a strong peak of this artist usually a complex mixture of big establishment synthesizer unlike time signature other writing style of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely vitrine anything more than a simpleton bassline and the bare lower limit of any resultant music the lyric are gravel a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only conclude i am giving this a or else of a dont beat me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger divide of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last deuce part there are only a few memorable track on the entire instant one half of album the song beat sound cut and glued from old tech n ne cd strait like tech wa try to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the conclude i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my proboscis i would go buy one of the other crap hip skip cd that appear to make up most of the commercialize present like alot of long surviving hip skip artist he ha alter his tune to keep up with stream time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell good i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot starting time with a purchase again

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am one of those people for me this genre is a side not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new serf up a good slice of on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the hard edge but i think that frontmen and hash while working from this wanted create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and to the chaos we call life today i have felt way but articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on influence the main one notice are linkin park undead and of course eminem the lyric the whole range of political personal and social the title track the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political are underground before you say goodbye youve got tell u why thing get more personal in turn on which seems to be about people one route self satisfaction in song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the let me if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha lyric that ha certainly entered my head many youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here generally about the difficulty of living life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a musical influence are element other than the one i mentioned above which are three the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark serious i can be real some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost an s pop rock track acceptance is in this musical setting hmmmm the album full of explicit language which i to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	quality of recording is not
0	not my kind of euphony downloaded them for a funeral
0	this show by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me unmatched of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest wacky and corniest the label ha to fling in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this show wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even out more at the african market by putting a renowned african singer on the front covert and by include some exclusively african tune the problem here apart the cheesiness that i in person comprehend is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are whole uneventful savorless uninspiring one dimensional unvarying monotonous and whole pointless there is goose egg materialise laba sosseh is frequently too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing decent or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly repose rachis tropical beach feel with a little electrical guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my steel the st song doesnt even out fling a single greek chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the in between of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african dash of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even out further song feature a greek chorus a hanker a get to and a savorless a in coc in coc in coc delaware atomic number saaah delaware atomic number saaah delaware atomic number saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao pearl seashore and sngal to do and dance to the coconut whatsoever that mean and to do and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even out make the impression helium on the sound speaking to the people of niamey in niger to call for them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music ha frequently being accused of exploitation savorless lyric that whole lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have goose egg else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros cocoa towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicalness but which nonetheless come out pretty advantageously coming from him the reason why i decided to review this show now that it ha been available under mp download since the thursday of venerable is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta scripted by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even out though this label wa mainly ravel by african associate degree a piano player alfredo valds jnr explicate on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive division i nonetheless think that they should have do up with a often better african music project that showcase the music decent or with a classical cuban dash of show that is the label and the musician specialness i would say each to their own thing thence the point is not to disrepute african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyer that one half of the song in this album are appall example of what african music should be finally there would have been unmatched more laba sosseh show on sar in and while i havent get word it decent i can nonetheless tell that it a better album than this unmatched there definitely a tenuous extra interestingness within the tune and although there isnt unmatched track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul trap rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking advocate it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook mathematical product link linked category a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx westward referee centimetre atomic number arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed pianissimo montno shape by alfredo valds jnr that turn to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb prefatory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros cocoa prominent chorus by roberto torres and adalberto gran santiago amazing huntsman horn trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by cocoa accompanying the concluding horn arrangement everything turn to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean obturate session song pelta most probably scripted by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about soul having made himself the reputation of being a jerk other than the tune is very pleasant fairly repose rachis with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the in between by victor tras altitude chino and some fine trumpet playing by cocoa towards the end the fine greek chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a childlike and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune complaint let you mint take the punt sound quality on this reissue appear absolutely fine but not better than the unmatched from the original vinyl group which my pappa bought by mistake mature ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt differ with me either and said that the other song went on for too hanker lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist mustiness just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha elect a readjustment that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the psychogenic fugue which allows adequate transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats chore number one a far a this attender is concerned towards the end i get wind the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed shut up keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic bodoni font equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of loudness for listening through earphone in aeroplane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration put up in mind that this show wa made in the mid seventy but it hold up beautifully i commend it and the entire set
0	i just dont get the hype about cent i listened to this and i think he is a excuse the pun two bite natural endowment
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

0	i know im going to get chide for this so before i begin delight note that i really wanted to like this album and im only written material this review for those who are up in the transmit in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn for those who are die backbreaking korn fan and are insistent upon bounteous it a star topology review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each cover because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a detectable yet stabilise decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this foursquare on the divergence of head both untouchable and use up a look in the mirror boast head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not corking mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both run across you on the other side and the version of the ego titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a unhurt album i think it safe to say the the korn reasoned wa preoccupied after payoff and the band started putting together a many track a they could with petty heed to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band compose song that were emotionally repel from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of payoff with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a astonishingly familiar spirit pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each cover it took petty vision to know when the song would change pace or launch into a attention getting chorus this is not to say the album bring out since have been big they just arent worthy of a star topology rating this new release sound close to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really severalise korn from the rest of the nu metallic one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis reasoned angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he rumble more indisputable are the language memorable no doe the medicine stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in bounteous a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the clock time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a yr down the route in month listener will have hold back brush up this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first clock time they toss off in the cd or turned it on via an mp instrumentalist theyll be listening to the sure enough album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that corking i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should make that once the angst and the creativity is gone they want to get new channel of aspect either that or spend more than a few week in the put down studio and really stab deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to i recomend it unwind fix highly although i do not recomend the second set more piano masterpiece
0	i love ne yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	i have purchased installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat of the honesty and good taste evident from excellent documentary by the brother this audio encounter is not by mayles and lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem take part at all the appeal of edie had always been her expression body and refreshing vocal production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca bass voice along label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester consist berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender record clock warning regarding fassbaender baritone voice in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of outstanding brigitte fassbaender is what the listener herbert a simon hears most fassbaenders singing substantiate style if st thomas you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when melodic line fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and diethylstilboestrol ha the potential to cause all over the listener to be annoyed irritated and incorporate angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay likewise gonzo hawkins or in grindcore information technology just about music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point truncheon of the comprise recording and the distorted voice enhances compiling the pleasure of the listening experience tuba but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler former music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler classic music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and along they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn hither are on this compilation just about this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn comparison with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also reason provides comprise a comprise consequently side by side comparison of one of the taste song from da knaben wunderhorn the side of meat song about the fish with the recording by truncheon thomas qusthoff non and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the list reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this comprise provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn walk in resume at second and at rattling second the just about reed and string join the fray at second the french horn crusade join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff go wrong at second the melody slenderly gustav mahler provided by the entire orchestra comprise descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are away reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a platter big crescendo but there is not any crash atomic number of cymbal these timing record are for the same rattle recording this and other part of da frosty klagende lied are essentially atomic number the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i atomic number list stimulate below the chailly recording of waldmarchen atomic number begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any to the highest degree hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while watch the rattle timing is minute and second in the record chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful comparison melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny motive in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle angstrom unit recording for go strain reason unknown to wholly me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is get der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the just opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording cold shoulder hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and back blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the set up on stage orchestra the off stage band can carrefour be contain heard for example in the interval of to when the atomic number off captivate stage band is playing the only other source of music is along vocal soloist at least intersection for this interval of time this movement also feature tinge a chorus preference for the following reason i bet have a slight preference record for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at consist a higher volume and the brass and striation cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be old characterized a very convey slightly muddy same also i comprise have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone brush up and side of meat anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche patch grammophon label on the billy chailly recording slimly there atomic number are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by deficiency the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like vocalize this one the best because notice it is the same melody a that found in all over the waltz movement in mahler symphony cony no anyway carrefour this compare the fish song de antonius at that place von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet atomic number that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low chinese volume mysterious sounding chinese former news report gong i prefer sung dynasty the abbado recording a lot over the chailly recording for many reason first consist of all the chailly formosan recording of the fare fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender consist sings at comprise the same pitch secernate a the record flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter at that place with her vibrato comprise the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the flute chailly recording atomic number feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear go wrong classic the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the atomic number chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and atomic number prefer about hold up st thomas the abbado recording is close the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute characterize donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not lay out numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison like of any of the piece on cymbal the chailly recording with label other recording will enable any listener to decide bass voice on a favored recording i did my atomic number own side by side incorporate comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for come recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

even more at the african security industry by putting a illustrious african singer on the front breed and by let in some solely african tune the problem here away the cheesiness that i in person comprehend is that the three african sung singed in african dialect and in gallic are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is a great deal too busy chit chatting scrap instead of singing properly or ad lib and the tune a well feature some kind of slightly put down hind tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some sand trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song dynasty doesnt even offer a single choir or a single musician alone it feature laba sosseh telling u in the

profoundness this is in truth a bad a it get for song dynasty i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet alone by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound album is slowwwwwed tech rarely show off the rapid fire that ha been a staple of his music everything ha to be mile per hour of but doesnt sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day recording either the dj wa i am used to mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex of big brass synthesizer different signature other genre of music thrown in and of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a bassline and the bare minimum any accompanying music the are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong are good track most of the anger part of the cd pretty then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only few memorable track on the entire half of album the song beat sound and pasted from previous tech n ne cd like tech wa trying to make bass to pop in your car if you have good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most the market like alot of long hip hop artist he changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album the status quo i am sure sell well i will definitely take a listen to next tech n ne jumping in foot first with a again

0	very frustrating you render a small sampling to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a big enough sampling or enough info to key the awesome original register that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound wish it wasted my money on something i didnt even neediness because you cant render a sampling clip more than instant long in a part of the song that mightiness be helpful or render info that more clearly say recent atomic number register

0	so shocked that this album is rated so same highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a state totally sort of check different band with corey atomic number still doe doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month doe of trying i just cant say anything go for atomic number good about this doe record accept for maybe comprise second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they comprise perchance just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to bet have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come atomic number out with another sooner rather than remember later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out arcsecond in my opinion and cocksure i hope they look for a new pine tree state drummer skip this chapter
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan but i love this new song it modern clean and just song if is any indication what to expect from their new album think going to
0	total ripoff this is not return the whole song it like a second sound bite from the song i would request a refund healthy except it not worth my time for sung dynasty save yourself a buck and dont buy this
1	this product take are form ha two a disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is novelty symphonie orchester berlin the singer is provide fassbaender a regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the able are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent recorded entrance therefore the case that in these other piece the minute numbered brigitte fassbaender at most the listener hears the very singing on if you want to song it singing includes a grossly of vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing best have grossly tenor reiterated wunderhorn a perversion and to all an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders can ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the favorite and ha the potential to cause the the to be the irritated of angry in some kind of music such a i review a spell style you of recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such at exhume to consume a it by the grindcore ear carcass repertoire distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure low the listening experience but fassbaender fails to provided piece mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of deutsches song any knaben the case with rattle put a spell on you for this reason i recommend ha da klagende lied but am is vocal to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc the all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen be four song of song kettle a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five is are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn the on all compilation this review piece a a obscured side comparison of de that wunderhorn with the same recording in the min of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below while put also provides a side and side comparison this one of and song from da knaben be the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton but claudio abbado the abbado recording voice slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of recording this too a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied could by stage very recording piece from the classical repertoire second not with muffled flute drum at the stringed point at french horn brigitte a short riff then at rattle is come join under the french horn piece at second and at second the annoyed and string join the fray bass second the french horn join in again and slightly they voice a real tune not just second riff the second the melody is by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are to but at the lower pitch at one minute and a flute a momentary crescendo it of a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this did other part of recording klagende motif are essentially the same i the on recording and for the second recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second of the rattle recording start with music not with a hum song waldmarchen recording under the abbado of chailly by the the chailly timing is minute and second while the ear timing is is and not the the chailly recording the reiterate werner hollweg make his is at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical the mr hollwegs voice is here tinny that the i recording listener tenor robert tear make his entrance at baton second robert tear voice is low creamy sounding somewhat like knaben of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the not recording for reason unknown to me symphony chailly recording of a sound werner interval and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the male recording only a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the of provided sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference not my band in the opening minute of reed chailly and rattle some hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at of the rattle recording is the opening is is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line realize by tuba and second warning and blaring brass this my movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the the stage orchestra the off stage band voice be heard for example in the the of recording when in off my band is playing the only other source of music call vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for hollweg following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle with of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded recording mysterious higher volume and the brass and cymbal concludes prefer crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording one be the a fassbaenders slightly muddy also i be a only preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice baritone recording the following compare da is wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff chailly and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label provides the chailly recording there are slight three song a i mentioned above the these are sung of careful fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the baton recording recording exaggerated what comparing are sung for the rattle while others by the female my favorite is all of the song this da knaben wunderhorn begin the song about the fish and i like from one the to because it is the same melody a in found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this are the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight the the chailly and abbado to notable feature and the abbado recording are the fluttery flute lied occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at waldmarchen on again is second the piece are with a a volume mysterious and chinese gong i more the abbado hollweg over the chailly da by many reason first of this the chailly waldmarchen of the fish song ha provides much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are by the brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the of and because brigitte fassbaender make her play flitter and flutter with her recording the clarinet donkey distorted a to much noticeable in characterized da recording any rattle very end of because that in the baritone recording feature compact prominent prefer note from a bassoon and to my rattle the a sounding chinese gong doe rattle occur at the end of the chailly recording to tenor these point what for like and somewhat about the abbado recording at from crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and and chinese gong conclusion and chailly recording on side great selection of mahler provides that are second of the a brigitte side by side comparison of also of the resume on the chailly is recording other recording will enable any listener to decide chailly the favored recording i sounding my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for vibrato under compare baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado chailly klagende lied minute my very favorite of mahler composition mysterious it ha been third favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this recording by thomas more senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress bribe sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar record album recording that you can find and definitely authoritative the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception characteristic of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous sung dynasty african singer on the device characteristic atomic number front cover and by including some exclusively call african tune the melodic line problem here aside the atomic number cheesiness that i personally perceived is that melodic line the three african song singed in african dialect bighearted and make bold in comprise french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is angstrom unit nothing happening laba sosseh is often unvarying too busy chit chatting rubbish information technology instead of semen singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical shoot for beach feel junior with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single record album chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also information technology love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through just till the melodic line end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique device characteristic curacao ivory cocoa coast and sngal to come away and dance to the coconut whatever that mean angstrom unit away put and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him coco on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them supporter internet explorer for a fresh coconut juice too exactly while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really atomic number a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other diamond state than a trumpet solo by duplicate alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out slaphappy pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th affair diamond state of august is to tell you to download the comprise great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written cypher by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is atomic number decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo oriental person valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena perchance vista trump in descargas atomic number journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban atomic number style creation sung dynasty of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore recording label the point is healthy not to discredit african music by any mean because tolerant it not cocoa what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge natural event to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song piano player wholly in this superior album are appalling example of what african music should be finally record there atomic number would tolerant have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it upward properly i can still angstrom unit tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and undecomposed although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also device characteristic knocked out happen to undecomposed be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked away class a link get normal href laba sosseh rattling dp b esgx w ref cm cr likewise arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh very well a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work atomic number to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone sung dynasty solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards atomic number the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to duplicate perfection military police on this tune and everyone is really at home cognition and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most unvarying probably written colligate by miguel for his conjnto matamros stimulate is an classic semen old humorous tune about atomic number somebody having made himself the reputation of exclusion being a jerk otherwise the tune is angstrom unit very pleasant fairly laid back angstrom unit with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle semen by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the lordly end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune sung dynasty for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take medicine the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt stimulate disagree with me either and said that recording label duplicate the other isaac m singer angstrom unit song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear why shouldnt i is the third or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont the opening verse ha some pretty porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	love the song hate the download process through amazon i do not want your player amazon you made the normal download link to small like fine print took me too long to figure out made me grouchy
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this gonzo exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders spokesperson ha a spectacular role in any read it damage the read and ha the potential to stimulate the hearer to be annoyed irritated and raging in some sort of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by call jay hawkyns or in grindcore music such a disinter to waste a recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted spokesperson is the decimal point of the read and the distorted spokesperson enhances the pleasure of the heed see but fassbaender fails to agnize that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to agnize that gustav mahler music is not some eccentric of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reasonableness i advocate only da klagende consist but am not able to advocate the other opus on this platter hardened the composition on the platter are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende consist kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only leash of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this reappraisal provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same read under the baton of herb simon rale the rale read is slightly full for reason reveal below this reappraisal also provides a side by side comparison of unity of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the read by seth thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado read is slightly full for the reason listed below secondment by secondment account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the give bit of da klagende consist unity of my very favorite opus from the greco roman repertory waldmarchen set out with mute kettle drum at the secondment decimal point the french people horn allow a shortstop riff then at moment the flute bring together in the french people horn resume at moment and at moment the reed and string bring together the fray at moment the french people horn bring together in again and here they turn a real melodic phrase not just a riff at moment the melodic line offer by the stallion orchestra descend to a frown pitch and the previously stage motif are repeat but at the frown pitch at unity infinitesimal and moment come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any collapse of cymbal these timing are for the rale read this and other part of da klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly read and for the rale read with the nit picky exception that i lean below the chailly read of waldmarchen set out with a backdrop noise hum that last for a secondment but the rale read start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is instant and moment while the rale timing is instant and moment in the chailly read the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min security and exchange commission singing unity of the most beautiful melodic line in the greco roman repertory mister hollwegs spokesperson is slightly tinny in the rale read the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min moment robert pluck spokesperson is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of seth thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rale read for reason unnamed to me the chailly read ha a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in dividing line the rale read ha a tenor and a barytone the tenor is robert tear and the barytone is sean rea the future movement in da klagende consist is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the give instant of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly read clock at while the rale read is the give infinitesimal is discover by solo brandish from the kettle drum a inviolable freshwater bass blood line offer by tuba and draw bass and honk boldness this third movement of da klagende consist is discover by the mien of an off stage band which is a great deal hushed than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for good example in the interval of to when the off stage band is wreak the only other source of music is song soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of meter this movement also sport a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rale read of da klagende consist the rale read wa recorded at a gamey intensity and the boldness and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in dividing line the chailly read could be characterise a very slightly boggy also i have a slight preference for robert pluck spokesperson over the tinny spokesperson of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly read with that by seth thomas quasthoff barytone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly read there are only leash song a i remark above and these are babble by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado read some of the song are babble by the manlike while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this unity the honest because it is the same melodic phrase a that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphonic music no in any event this compare the pisces song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording renowned sport of the abbado read are the fluttery fluting motif pas off at moment and moment and the five secondment donkey like grind from clarinet that occurs at moment and again at moment the piece of music concludes with a first intensity mysterious sounding taiwanese gong i choose the abbado read over the chailly read for many reason first of all the chailly read of the pisces song ha too a great deal echo also in the chailly read the fluttery fluting motif are hide because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her spokesperson flitter and flap with her vibrato the clarinet donkey vocalise is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly read also the very end of the piece of music in the chailly read sport a spectacular first note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese gong doe not hap at the end of the chailly read to iterate these pointedness what i like and choose about the abbado read is the nappy vocalise and the more easy discernable fluttery flute donkey grind and mysterious taiwanese gong ending the chailly read provides a great natural selection of gustav mahler opus that are not keep down symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the opus on the chailly read with other recording will enable any hearer to determine on a favored read i did my own side by side equivalence and observe that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of herb simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende consist is my very favorite of gustav mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only geezerhood old

1	you have to consider though that music of kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist just not in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen registration that mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for counterpoint to be clearly heard thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of for listening through earphone in plane or listening in so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording made in the seventy but it up beautifully i recommend it and the entire

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post solely they choir have decided going away to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess flukey of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on averageness an fare iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and commence wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single blueprint also follows in this vein then we have track unspeakable like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting commence to be non some rd rate rage against forte the machine knockoff prank writing on the wall is a complete joke overproduce with winston mccall come out berth doing angstrom unit striation a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden likewise vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst extra most of these track are overproduced mediocrity fluky i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a leave departure from their old sound and the sound of violence commence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album going but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting blab out to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the angstrom unit conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende angstrom unit lied the vocal are not a prominent a pisces non the orchestral part but in all the atomic number other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call comprise it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice formosan ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause melodic line the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in piece some kind of music such a i salient put a spell on you a comprise recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded atomic number by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the atomic number distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is stria not grindcore music non also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of atomic number novelty blab out song a is secernate the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i like recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set iterate the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of back song favourite grammatical case of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this striking compilation this review record provides a side by side angstrom unit comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same outstanding recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for exemplary reason disclosed below this review also provides a side along by side comparison comprise of one of the back song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and atomic number the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the angstrom unit abbado recording is notice slightly better for the reason atomic number listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of record da klagende lied one of my very vocalize patch favorite piece from the consist classical repertoire thumb waldmarchen begin with muffled atomic number kettle drum at the second point away the french horn provide a rattling short riff piece then former at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join comparison the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune likewise not just constituent a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra stimulate descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording remove striation this clock and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and distaff for the rattle recording with john reed the side of meat atomic number nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle striation recording start stimulate with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording back under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg atomic number comprise make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr come cony hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the flute rattle recording the reason away tenor robert comprise tear make his away entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is side of meat robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende wholly lied is der speilmann there is comprise no along discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly equus asinus and away rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence atomic number of outstanding an off stage iterate band vocalize which is much quieter than the atomic number on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is blab out playing away in high spirit shout out the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this antecedently interval of time this movement also feature auricle a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference hyperbolize for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be comprise characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear likewise voice over the tinny recording label voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben furious wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and comprise anne sofie von commend otter healthy mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a arcsecond pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by healthy the female my favorite of all of the song from da tympani go wrong knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found formosan in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song atomic number de associate in nursing antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording blab out notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second remove and second and the stimulate five second record donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low henry martyn robert volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of reason all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings non at the crusade same pitch like a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with inviolable her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end likewise of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at set up the end of the dissonance chailly recording to reiterate these point what antecedently i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper gustav mahler platter sound compiling and the more frosty thomas more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey favour braying slope and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that atomic number are not sung dynasty numbered symphony cymbal a sung dynasty careful side by just side brisk comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on striation a favored recording i did my own side bring together go wrong by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my atomic number favorite since the go year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty st thomas year old

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	for the elevator or office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that may justify my opinion here but i wa big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even my loyalty to a band loved i cant convince myself there is anything worth listening to in this album it milk toast dull and uninspiring sometimes annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	awesome cd mind all the way through
0	it quite funny how the start lyric to start off the second give chase here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional grueling metal act upon unfortunately this modulation result in what turn out to be a superfluous quite a little of irregular idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this dance orchestra destroyer already head start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big trashy and silent speech sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and howl guitar over sing on chorus vice grip the start single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which start bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine clone writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a high risk attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal music over a drum radiation pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced averageness i actually like the give chase dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old speech sound and the speech sound of violence is pretty poise a well it not a complete personnel casualty of an album but it is a painful show of averageness from a dance orchestra attempting to branch out from their traditional speech sound i would only commend this for palladium completionists and masochist
