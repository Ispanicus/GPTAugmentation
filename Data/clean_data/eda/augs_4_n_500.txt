0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am bungle away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have constantly considered tech normality ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album hour angle had a different feel to it i have constantly been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that hour angle constantly been a staple of his music not everything hour angle to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sabbatum around eating painkiller all clarence day before recording either the dj washington completely uninspired i am victimised to tech background mix to be a strong place of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different fourth dimension signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am give way this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech normality ne cd sound like tech washington adjudicate to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech normality ne if i treasured to thump my body i would go buy one of the other shite hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the grocery nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he hour angle vary his tune to keep up with current fourth dimension he now hour angle produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure enough it will sell well i will emphatically take a long listen to the next tech normality ne album before jumping in foot first with a buy again

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna to their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest exposure

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother audio is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased i will happen something better not worth it
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	flagpole genus sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not either mean like it or not once you hear it it is stuck in your caput i am one of those who like it hence that is why i downloaded it it may not be the greatest song ever done but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick
1	the story wa good the music wa so so we hail from new jersey and grew up listening to the four season we used to follow them intensely wherever they were appearing we know their sound the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong he wa singing to falsetto you know over doing this is our opinion but then again we are jersey girl
1	metallic element this song really won me song dynasty over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song i wa sold that wa when i decided to purchase this song she reminds me of a japanese shakira the donde estan los ladrones shakira soulful gritty heart thread tugging soul speaking singer

1	incredible scream great melodic breakdown incredible emotion curious to see how the adjacent album is you can tell this set doe their own thing ha their own style and doe not conform that is what make them great con album is a little too short some of the song sound similar
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa wasnt the seller geological fault

0	be intimate the band but there only one good song on this release seriously anything that say feat in it is old fashioned and unoriginal if you are so good why do you need help it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita john ford had a hit together and now everyone is doing it seriously keep the disc jockey out none of the good one know wtf they are doing i will pa on this one collide is much better and song at that
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the justly song unfortunately not a orotund enough sample or enough info to identify the amazing original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not amazing because now they are old sound like it emaciated my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that power be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
1	classic redman glad to see him back
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their along the way but imaginos one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to too saleable on it own album is not a total kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja coming soon
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give star so this album can be on you are husband should be in jail for stealing

1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested played at his funeral and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
0	i thought i wa corrupt the original recording from the but i bought some other modern song rendition what a shame amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music who on earth want to hear to fake skynyrd
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a dissimilar totally different band soh with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why promise doe every song also operating room have to have long slow start promise the only positive group a i can think of is that this is a new album endorse and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it tax return will be a return to form earlier for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i can recall hand that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before

1	i know that some people can discus at length the maine merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new blunt band abica serf up blunt a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the particular same hard edge but deservingness i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre associate in nursing wanted to create something of more universal appeal and indium significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a matter lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park maine hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the populate hopelessness racecourse which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on slang which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think comprise i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete soft if i just had you just another never that lyrical far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your hashish choosing in a society populate that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell oral communication you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and saucer psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your merely matter eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop soh rock track and acceptance is depicted upwards in this musical setting hmmmm the reverberate album is full of comprise explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but let in if along you are ok with free expression you will hear comprise dish antenna an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but intimately to me songwriting is not her strength and whole that decent seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power operate wasnt her through with strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not janis joplin even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome
0	i do not anyone over age of like or can relate to or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig a band doe not count you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not ground for you to like it
0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess i will live with it

1	lov it
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd wish i would have listened to it first not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better
0	the worst try hard band i heard how did turd get an album out oh yeah rich parent ugh lovely it do not waste your money
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part lupus erythematosus in co writing his song and i am sure centennial state this search one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album disconsolate this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry to the lowest degree lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio full to work the magic
0	i would recommend finding a different version to merely download i absolutely love this song it ha good sound quality but they cut off the entire last word note it drive me crazy and really ruin the track

0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i do not think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is military policeman for me trump one of the worst new download york group a sar recording that you can find and definitely bingle the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to diddle offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in along african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar medicine and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in whole the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a by right traditional african style of dance former that other country in besides africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in null coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate military policeman towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out seacoast pretty well coming from him pastime choir the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been bachelor of art available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on beau ideal mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run along by african intimately associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of represent buena vista exquisitely in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better first state african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the santiago de cuba label and the saccade musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what maine i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i indium just want to warn buyer that half of the to the highest degree song in this album saltation are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i declare oneself have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not interest one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it piece of work to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh reprinting a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement grease one palm a powerful and solid a good deal trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and style comprise some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn way arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very group a pleasant fairly laid back with a set of past to the highest degree solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish atomic number slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i song dynasty will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not basic disagree comprise with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked cosmos melody and were unexciting too

0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no one ha noticed is unbelievable
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a indium registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job in number one a far a this listener is listen concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme readjustment of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme select of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really information technology a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i more often than not recommend it and the entire set

0	the vinyl group other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what make out apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial record album goal issue at the high end of the commercial along price range

1	assuredness cool
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on album there are four song by the ray orchestra with mary martin doing the singing is the plus a it is always pleasure to hear her should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	stylistically i love all type of but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is rock i do not know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work drawing from old school music from i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

1	her usual perfect music love it
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found oral communication this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the film tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not closeness stimulate at all and seem wa frankly betwixt a little humdrum

0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd it is not on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note time rather than played live i would love to know where came with the at the rhodes piano for the title

0	i former have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is lodge a solo album group a by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another cause the rather pointless player re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt expiration enough material to work with and if you are going to call this actualize a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be put out released a a blue oyster cult album randomness apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on put out it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the corresponding baron frankenstein number but i am very group a glad that i did not pay for it on on line ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strong point and that seems to be what she went with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent representative that convinced with soul and depth still if power wasnt her strong point this record album is more like day in the aliveness ditty to be honest i could not still give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in cast together this collection
1	love this song dynasty song
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer dos is brigitte vocalist fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these custom other piece the voice of tattle brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you tympanum want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted percentage voice is the point of the recording and the commend distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music indium also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is finish the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set comprise the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen district attorney all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de sale talk knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about hour angle the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the memorialise baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute group a join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here book they play a real tune not just a auditor riff at second melodic line the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the indium lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this to the highest degree and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the outspoken same for the chailly recording and for the comportment rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music comprise not waver with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the finish chailly timing memorialise is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and past second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one arcminute of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear keep down voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast inspection the rattle recording ha a memorialise tenor district attorney and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable goal difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the magnetic disc chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage poor band cause is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following passably reason i have a well nigh slight preference for the rattle magnetic disc recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher astatine volume and indium the brass sale talk and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over feature article the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie information technology von otter memorialise indium mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording on that point there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte world health organization fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the endorse song book are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare comprise the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the pisces chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the comparing abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the district attorney fish indium song ha too much echo also in group a the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte domestic as fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey rattling sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also actualize the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious whatever sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable stagecoach any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year information technology it wa composed when mahler patch wa indium only twenty year old

0	i am not a music critic i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not savour the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again shortly still listening to all of their other album daily
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of act a itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first break up of the psychogenic fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be understandably heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and walter reed still hold back within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earpiece in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it obligate up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	this album consists of the of side of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be before buying album expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i know i am going to afterward get lambasted for this so before i begin conceive please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn textile iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not comprise for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn inspection album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i comprise will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the nice edition truly of the self conceive titled album however a few redeeming track doe choice not make up a whole album i think it safe comprise to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a difficult they could more than with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy immortalise on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar unobtainable choice pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the afterward song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new afterward release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the more than radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than operating room the last two yes doe he growl effectual more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this comprise new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via involve an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how marvel the new album just is not that great i do not want picayune to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that raging once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and military policeman really dig deep for something from the group a soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever it so overplayed way overrated
1	tragically it ha been solemn one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that group a i have adored about natalie kick the bucket is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful dish out from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of afterward great song self asserting that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her racecourse career and her life in film the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with love the same title name from it is a lovely memorialise song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so administer much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i came of age during the s and to this clarence shepard day jr the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and unsanded i agree with the reviewer who prefers to retrieve the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the interlingual rendition feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	i have been a big peachy boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all randomness it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger happy the song are world health organization ponderous washington and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to barely indicate that there comprise wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck scuttlebutt dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cadmium cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable indium on it own the album is not a on line total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that non i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope past to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	tiresome i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a astatine little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college group a student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take minginess part at all the appeal of little closeness edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at make out all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met hour angle my husband of year what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer
0	the background is not a background you can mind the kid singing
0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing fizgig in a band department of energy not count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even wide eyed word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they articulate listening to it make me like it if you were habitual to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same construct with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily grate for you to like it

0	essentially my sister year honest to goodness is mind to this garbage in the other way and it is aggravating i do not like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to hold on it customer shopping happy and thus spending dough in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wish something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small and the world at large anyone who like this doe not like music but i would not sleep together i do not like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that sleep together how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti piss

0	mp is of bad quality be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp s have downloaded about or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something edit my mp skipping problem wa traced back to my dial up connection sure to download amazon mp s via broadband for music quality
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video i did not like the rap in the middle did not seem to fit the song
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is for the most part flute sound for the number part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the contrast to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this carrying into action would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to concentrate the extreme of bulk for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic roll is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording evergreen state made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i accolade do not understand how this album won award i would ask for my money back if i could
0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sing through his olfactory organ just take the song stink even worse and take me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i washington in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to some other store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally sing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyrist who wrote this pick of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public washington sold a bill of rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the scum by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way of life up i like ne yo but his sing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other commentator must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way of life in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what on key sing talent is anymore cause this is not it
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get idea ever since untouchable there ha a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa good not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a chorus this is to say the album released since have been bad they are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the memorable no doe the music stand out not really sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do want to rip the band because they are still of my favorite but a band should that once the angst and the creativity is they to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for from the the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	great music the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk it wa very difficult to play my group a copy like most people i have more then one device to play a cd in this cd doe not work in most of them
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself percentage and a far a i get wind am concerned the organist must just not get in the way operating room of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough readjustment transparency for the comprise counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards attractively the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of auditor volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy rig but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	i just like it

0	this senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the silliest corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo feature laba sosseh telling u in middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba all the way through the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting people martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal and dance to the coconut whatever mean and come and drink fresh coconut juice with on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still that they should have come up with a much better african music project showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own therefore point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be there would have been one more laba sosseh recording sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp esgx w ref cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the there is a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and is really home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i transferred onto a cd a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	billy joel is not one of my favorite musician but his music on this album wa a steal at the sale price i got on it
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass this portion is so i can listen to it over and over
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one consecrate of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i group a have felt interahamwe this way piece of work but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically trouble they draw on various influence in a higher place the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why tattle thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish soft is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that atonement far away and nothing here are generally about comprise the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is former tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence select there are group a element other than the one fellowship i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i group a can be real and some other comprise track have obtrusive an industrial sound reminiscent pastime of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element style then includes some astatine excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream oral communication sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness lyrical come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the call for time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track well nigh and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting common hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which wide i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people scarey who can not take that by all mean stay away cause but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i do not prefer spanish singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick the same song i do not get it
1	love this vinyl radical
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have distinct to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena tumid beat fill and roar guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first unmarried also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first burn off eden shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate craze against the machine knockoff writing on the fence is a pure joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a beat pattern lifted from queen we will rock you pure with nickname in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a pure loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for atomic number completionists and masochist
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i do not know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the conk out go mixed with a heap smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you featherbrained ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore ohio so great in fireflights alone sound i must state these constituent are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their television available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i reassure you

0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good condition yet of it wa unplayable very disappointed
1	classic record album al stuff in his usual humorous style early in al album every song is great
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret or even fire garden but gospel and blue eccentric singing genial of a turn off i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
1	jazz this song
0	the the song is not my favorite unfortunately i think this is the only version released i tried to find the song on soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing back helium this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he merely is done something to change his technique and he often sound helium nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method
0	when wilson first broke into country music her hit such a redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh mount wilson and brash now her latest single do not do me no good is just uninspired it sound like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice comprise when she sings on this track yeah i know it aint right to sit around all night and let information technology your memory get the best of group a me
1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with someone you love
1	this wa a well received gift can not go wrong with john lennon anything
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i never expect from this band destroyer already start this on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing chorus vice grip the first single follows in this vein then we track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	wherefore like the other review of this gift the question is why why wa this even recorded and released that is just for starter

0	dim
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert atomic number unfinished symphony played on move period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and comprise i think that the rich colour of his whole original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama diddle and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle group a with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player classical music are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any conceive more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music corresponding sound involve so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people corresponding who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar close to washed down with chilled chardonnay and are think disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i have all joshs originate awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd wish i would have listened to it first not piece of work what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me there were a few non track that were good but not the usual great work effectual i wa use to maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on cadmium me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a great singer washington without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	best cd i bought in a year i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case in these other piece of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener be annoyed and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some novelty song a is the case with i put a on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are only three of the thirteen of the song of de wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side side de wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real not a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal are for the rattle recording this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the of chailly rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second the chailly recording the werner hollweg his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the drum a bass line provided by and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by presence of an stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus for the following reason i have a slight for the rattle recording da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado the deutche grammophon label on chailly recording there only three song a i mentioned above these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying mysterious chinese gong conclusion chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on favored recording i did my own side side comparison and discovered that i had slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	i consider it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i do not prefer spanish people singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already ill used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i do not get it

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am bobble off by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n northeast to be one of finally great bastion of hip joint hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip joint hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every record album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this record album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely depict off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hr of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat or so eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a building complex mixture of big brass synthesist different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest taste or so this record album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this record album the only reason i am present this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the finally two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire arcsecond half of record album the song beat sound cut down and pasted from previous tech n northeast cd sound like tech wa nerve racking to make a bass cd to pop in your motorcar if you have a good sound organization not the reason i buy tech n northeast if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip joint hop cd that seem to make up most of the market present like alot of long surviving hip joint hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible record album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n northeast record album before jumping in foot low with a purchase again

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they neediness to buy korn iii for those who are pop off firmly korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a undivided listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the maiden few you will get the idea of all time since untouchable there hour angle been a obtrusive even so steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will include that there are a few ransom track on both go steady you on the other incline and the edition of the self titled album however a few ransom track doe not cook up a whole album i think it safe to order the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with piffling regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly conversant pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took piffling imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a tricky chorus this is not to order the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this modern release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativeness that really branch korn from the rest of the nu alloy one hit curiosity polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound tempestuous on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the medicine stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a modern album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for modern textile but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will find the same about the phonograph record calendar month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this modern release and they will forget how they initially heard it the maiden time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the modern album just is not that great i do not neediness to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativeness is gone they need to find modern channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest and immediately went and bought the album i wa disappointed only enjoyed a few song the only time the heed to the album is when i have trouble oneself sleeping do not waste your time and money
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
1	love the work wish the more than cd had more track
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak however not stating this is second long is almost misrepresenting itself in fact it is listen to the free you have heard of the interview shame on amazon
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	imo this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone awful listen to the preview if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great then go for it
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor his voice a example of perfection his story make his music even more touching i hope he get the attention of american his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart
0	yuck
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am one of those people for me this genre a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when hear it new band abica up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted create something more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now way a lot of u feel a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think say the anguish over failed relationship pursuit ha line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will me to stay beautiful ha a lyric ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and here are generally about the difficulty of living of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that them a more mainstream just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the for track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past the along word of god renews my spirit daily
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a unproblematic band i loved i can not convince allegiance myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum come out rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn testament it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will unproblematic once again find the place charles frederick worth splendor of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	it is quite funny how the swell first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to clone emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect outset from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for on the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which come out first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against group a the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a merely bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated experience a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of group a violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album zachary taylor experience but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this product take the form of compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece the two disc the vocal are more prominent is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders style you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and be an the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind music such a i put a spell on you a by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler is not grindcore also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at the french horn join in again here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are rattle recording this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the same the recording and the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the of to when the off stage band is the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following i have a slight preference the rattle recording da lied the rattle recording wa recorded a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more and dramatic contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the compare da knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there only song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i this one best because it the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute occurring at second and second the five second donkey like braying from clarinet occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding gong prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording many reason first of all the chailly recording the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what like and prefer about recording is the crisper sound and the more discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony careful side by side comparison of any of piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	this intersection take the mould of two compact car magnetic disk on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal music are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two magnetic disk the vocal music are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the vocalize of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener get a line most fassbaenders singing manner if you neediness to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato campaign fassbaenders singing to be grossly malformed to be a perversion and to be an contumely to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vocalize ha a prominent office in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to campaign the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a enchantment on you a recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the malformed vocalize is the point of the recording and the malformed vocalize enhances the delight of the listening experience but fassbaender flush it to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender flush it to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a enchantment on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this magnetic disk set the composition on the magnetic disk are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the baker dozen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rale the rale recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason name below second by second story of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening here and now of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertory waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a brusque riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and chain join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real number tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are retell but at the lower pitch at one second and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rale recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit picky exception that i number below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rale recording start with music not with any hum equate waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is second and second while the rale timing is second and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his trance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertory mister hollwegs vocalize is slightly tinny in the rale recording the tenor robert buck make his trance at min second robert buck vocalize is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat alike that of thomas quasthoff frankincense i have a very tenuous penchant for the rale recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rale recording ha a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is robert buck and the baritone horn is sean rea the next motility in da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the opening second of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rale recording is the opening second is distinguished by solo tucket from the kettle drum a strong freshwater bass line provided by sousaphone and draw freshwater bass and blasting face this rd motility of da klagende lied is distinguished by the mien of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the time interval of to when the off stage band is act the only other source of music is vocal music soloist at least for this time interval of time this motility also feature a chorus penchant for the following reason i have a tenuous penchant for the rale recording of da klagende lied the rale recording wa recorded at a higher mass and the face and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a tenuous penchant for robert buck vocalize over the tinny vocalize of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fish and i alike this one the serious because it is the same melody a that encounter in the waltz motility in mahler symphony no in any event this compare the pisces the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey alike grind from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low mass mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender tattle at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her vocalize flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very finish of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong energy department not occur at the finish of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i alike and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey grind and mysterious chinese gong ratiocination the chailly recording provides a great option of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a tenuous penchant for recording under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa compose when mahler wa only twenty year onetime

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and scriptural truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some somewhat deep concept and putting word and music to them that work absolutely together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good human being cry it is a song written from the position of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am grateful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic bumble on christian radiocommunication

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin note that i really wanted to like this and i am only writing this review for those who are up in air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a album not great wa still decent and i will admit that are few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced in the s with each it took little to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this release sound closer to mirror than last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i been starved for new material but lately i been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will stopped reviewing this new release and will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	sorry the head and the heart but i just do not get it i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money
0	this recording by senegalese vocalizer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me unrivalled of the worst fresh york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in fresh york with the exclusion of the three song i already mentioned this recording evergreen state of course an obvious wrapped in try to aim even more at the african market by putting a famed african vocalizer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french people are altogether uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and altogether pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy check chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid punt tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh impressive u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also bang to dance to and promote them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh tempt the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and wassail fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that altogether lack of depth this is really a unfit a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under military police downloads since the th of revered is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta save by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military police downloads even though this label evergreen state chiefly run by african connect a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still believe that they should have come up with a a lot amend african music project that showcase the music properly or with a authoritative cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the guide is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling case of what african music should be finally there would have been unrivalled more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a amend album than this unrivalled there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not unrivalled track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show amend with a self aggrandizing hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also take place to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w referee cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb prefatorial trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone motor horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final motor horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at house and in their own thing here descrga in latin music condition mean jam session song pelta most belike save by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about mortal having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant middling laid punt with a set of solid motor horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you mess take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not amend than the unrivalled from the master copy vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not take issue with me either and said that the other song move on for too long miss strain and were unstimulating too

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me feature article one of the worst new york sar recording that file away you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest group a and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in consociate trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some declare oneself exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried in monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh non is often too busy chit chatting choice rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also by right feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap rig drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature noesis laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a close to traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in group a coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than whatsoever that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of newfangled martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and whole dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now besides that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be piece of work skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run saltation by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i memorialise still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the sus out label and the notable seacoast musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do hole and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling grease one palm example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more phantasy laba sosseh recording on sar in and while indium i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid french horn organization cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend close to it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook resolve product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed fulfil piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to withal perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate choir outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn comprise arrangement everything work to perfection academic term on this tune and everyone is really memorialise at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most download probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly group a laid back with a set of declare oneself solid horn style arrangement a bright tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by past chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing washington throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you flavourless lot place take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for reprinting too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have genuinely all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on backside the radio medicine kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my run biggest concern with this album and to be group a honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if operating room life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this mind multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in hither the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i alone found coloured so disdainful johnny cash unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for non the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have non been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had hour angle technical school a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a nor east staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like perpetually tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of pelvic girdle music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying whole music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this fourth dimension album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and lyrical pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i choler buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of group a the other crap hip hop cd once again that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he seldom ha changed his tune to keep up with leverage current time he now comprise ha produced an accessible album for the nitrogen status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next pelvic girdle tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase cadmium again

0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the unharmed cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it advance with that goal in listen i listened to the unharmed album elsewhere i really do not bonk how to key out how i palpate it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to keep out up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the downplay now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be capable to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and punk not that i think amazon river is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard gain dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for
0	no rocky top why bother that is like quick beer cold pizza close but not quite
0	this album consists of the song of side ii of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world notable hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not deserving it i can not knock the biblical passage though not particularly easily read but the interpretive part is not easily done i should note that my eschatology is in total dissonance but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration hour angle no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a a lot higher rating than the ii star i get back for were they not better found in their original circumstance shotgun angel

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash went to on the billboard hot and wa billboard most popular song of that fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the shuffle though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in history of that era of hear there actually a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i not have any knowledge of how the go if you do perhaps you will clue u in

0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case i am livid
0	i concur with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song get wind it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric poem are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel secure i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but she is still got a long way to go to get there
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
