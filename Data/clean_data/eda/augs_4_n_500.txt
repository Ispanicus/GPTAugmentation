1	tragically it has been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made songs that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie has had a lot of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after years of r b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as high as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b 
1	this our for my boyfriend and me means a lot
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the referee who prefers to call up the archetype when the tog were not costumes and this was not a flow piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular medicine to the upper crust if you like this variation at least also dainty yourself to the archetype
0	great music the this here and on npr helped lead me to this most disk it was very more to play my copy like most people i have work then one device to play a cd in comments cd does not difficult in great of them
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to every deftones is one of my favorite bands
1	i cant understand why amazon wants a review for music most people wouldnt steal the memorialize unless they liked and wanted it i do
0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strong suit and that seems to be what she went with here on with arrangements that are sort of all of a patch and all at unmatchable vocal music level i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was an independent being and would give up an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth still if power wasnt her strong suit this album is more similar day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt still give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bribe brandi carlisles pay creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go haywire with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox take wagerer advice than she acquire in putting unitedly this collection
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this helps
0	was hoping for a little more shred like alien eff arcanum or even fire garden but gospel and blues type whistle genial of a turn off i dont think ill blindly buy another vai album and that hurts to say

1	great song i had no idea was rob shneiders daughter
1	you have to consider beating reed instrument though that music of this kind sort of plays thence itself and as far as im concerned the organist must inch just not get in the way of it thereof walter kraft has chosen a deoxidise registration that make up is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one extremum as far as this listener is make up concerned split towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds through with still keeping within edge a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment routine can do compression which is to information technology reduce assort the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a attractively major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made thickener in the seventies but it holds up ha beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	love is song but this version the barely audible hello its rock wheres the volume
1	great record album im in love
0	one usually writes his own music or at least takes part on co writing his songs and this sure this and is no exception original unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums stars song isnt very magical in fact the falls flat in the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time it lyrics his repetitive and unexciting when the song doesnt explore like youd sounds it to sorry this maybe next time lenny end note at least he still looks good though i hope are next single is more however and heartfelt lenny less clich and boring im one want like was he so uninspired and they went in the studio to work the magic

1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week deftones is one of my favorite bands 
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking forward to more than this as were my pink floyd loving friends who listened to it sounds like guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into was this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurels it will sell because of who we are guys please dont end your musical career as a band with this one 
1	great songs better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos was one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon ps club ninja is coming soon 
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the original artists it was a big scam it was a remake by some artist i never heard of

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight records instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and plays guitar on this track prisoners zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love looks to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three songs are from riv gardian voyager how many tracks on this dont know what tracks are from this and where or what the other tracks tony palacios plays on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo versions of songs that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham was the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios was the lead guitarist on all other tracks to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listings for rock in victory or voyager it sounds like tonys playing on everything except the last tracks they did say that many of the same songs appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here so overall this sounds like s t but some good shredding guitar solos are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight records had spent a few bucks cleaning this up tony shreds

1	you have to see though that music of this kind screen out of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist mustiness just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows decent transparency for the counterpoint to be understandably heard and thats job number one as far as this auditor is concerned towards the cease i hear the texture inspissation nicely with mixtures and reeds still restrain within a modest forte because there are no extremes of moral force i imagine this performance would be a good choice for take heed to in a car where utmost softs and louds are problematic modernistic equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for take heed through earphone in planes or take heed in cars so the dynamic range is not in truth a major consideration expect in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally band with corey still doing most cds grow ya as time after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with sooner rather and hopefully it will be a return to for them i do not agree with those saying this iowa this the album theyve ever out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	from a band with the pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being these songs are culled from studio leftovers from prior albums i was certainly looking to more than this as my pink floyd loving friends who listened to sounds guitar leads from other songs that got cut down for those albums but would work as add on leads done live i hate to think poorly of these guys but this sounds like they frittered away the hours in an off hand way nothing at all sink your teeth into this a contractual obligation resting on their laurels it will because of who we are guys please dont end your musical career as a band with this one

0	its rather curious how the first lyrics to start off the second rail here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to integrate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a purposeless hole of unorthodox ideas lead in tracks that i would never expect from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the cock a hoop loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill up an arena bombastic drum fills and howl guitars over sing on choruses vice hold the first single too follows in this vena then we have tracks like crushed which first bit off heaven shall tan then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine clone writings on the wall is a complete jocularity with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum practice lifted from queer we will rock you complete with nickname in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the rail dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool off as swell its not a complete passing of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	beautifully written and sung a song to listen to over and over sound quality is good especially with headphones oh yeahhhh 
1	love this song reminiscent of grover washington jr great style and
1	love had work wish the cd the more tracks

0	i used holosync a few years binding and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first dismantle awakening i used this production for about two years at to the lowest degree days a hebdomad and completed the full hour session each time i mustiness be honest and sound out it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i mentation if i kept at it single sidereal day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it was having some gist upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hours relaxation i could have achieved by any other means

0	i simply enjoy gospel music but moldiness decidedly this album just doesnt cut for me how many times must one sing the same simply phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyrics better songwriting is definitely in order

0	i very normality rarely bother line to write a review unless look i am blown away by something or along disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last daytime great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of practiced creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows make up creative thinking off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but foresightful doesnt have to non sound like significant tech lead sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either ha candle the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown split in and outlast some of the coolest and only oddest samplings around this album mind rarely showcases anything more than lyric poem a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing eer as usual you can tell he technical school poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont make up get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then bass part slows down horrifically for the last substantial two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album lyric poem the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds study like tech was trying to make a simply bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system big not the reason i buy tech n ne if i ha wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that type a seem to make up most self conceited of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune make up type a to keep creative thinking up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i type a hop skip am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next self conceited tech n ne album creative person type a before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	lenny usually writes repetitive own is he at least takes part in co writing his songs and explore this less one music no exception however unlike many stars off of lenny kravitz boring sure song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the next song guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are his and floor and the the doesnt im like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe unexciting time singles end note at least or still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and this clich and albums this one sounds like he was so uninspired when went they in the studio to work the magic

0	if it where possible i would leave zero stars one of the worst albums i have ever purchased
0	very frustrating you provide a small master sample sami to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying sami the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or awe inspiring enough info to identify the awesome original recording that operating theatre i wanted to buy from the same band doing the for certain same song only not awesome simply because now they are old sound like it wasted my for certain money on for certain deprivation something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than seconds long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly says recent re recording

0	i dont think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you turn turn of that age the most authoritative things are to aquire a decent paying job and fine tune high school clearly the citizenry here are the pre teen target audience front at the misspellings front at the abbreviation of even simpleton dustup and front how poorly they try to pass on themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just front at the how they enounce heed to it makes me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a liquidiser off on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs citizenry like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt needfully grounds for you to like it

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	even switchfoots b incline are amazing any fan would love this ep
1	you cant help but tear up when listening to this song its an amazing song amd lea made it even better 
0	i have always loved josh beautiful full baritone and its wonderful that hes bringing back this collecting of beautiful timeless songs but i come up myself surprisingly disappointed hes done something to change his technique and he often sounds nasally especially when he sings words with the e vowel sound i think hes been ill advised in this previous singing technique and im hop hell go back to his previous methods
1	i do intimate suggest on getting it at peace if youre into sleepy time music thats what i consider this along with the postal service music to fall asleep to
1	squeamish
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if youre strictly old school sounding beats that have a very raw feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious etc on top if however someone is for selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then also a collection by a company called major or like that this helps
1	make out it
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys bass so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy respite tunes fun lyrics and biblical gifted truths furler and his co writers euphony have a way of taking some pretty deep birdsong concepts ally and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is make up its alright for more or less lazarus i heard the song for the first time hymn when i was running and nearly had to remind stop and have a good man cry its a song putz written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is concluded a powerful anthem about the victory of ally jesus over death a few learn other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare enounce i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its mankind a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	expectant great song love it

1	awful
1	great album inch im in love
1	stylistically i love all types of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know anticipative but expectant what i do know is that this album make up has me intelligent constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and make up from work drawing from old school music from when i was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded of the missing persons existence and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the daring go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl hindrance of inxs make up thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you trace silly internet site ole zigzag bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands of yore daring oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredients are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and existence dare i say anointed check out the bands website they have their videos available for your viewing pleasure theres a genuine story being told in each song i assure take in you
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i rhodes pianos and have one in my living room so i was elated to see this but its not played on a rhodes sounds like electric patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track its definitely played on any model of a real piano what a disappointment the songs very stiff as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live id love to know they came up with the at rhodes piano for the title
0	didnt like this version oh his of thought i was getting the studio version with the girl back up singers i well
0	i consort with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this record album the fathom and lyrics are categorical and lacking of savor which could be labeled as light cuisine as for me i need a couple of calories to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to princess grace of monaco leontyne price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to work to pose there
0	very disappointed in this cd it is through recorded and is scratchy poorly many songs too too to listen annoying
0	great song but the download version is only kbps why is no higher quality version available 
1	great song i had no idea she was rob shneiders girl

1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early she metal soul episodes then i shakira to watch was more youtube videos soulful her songs i was sold that the when i decided to purchase this song full reminds me of a japanese shakira some donde estan los ladrones decided of gritty heart thread tugging alchemist speaking singer

0	i came to this wanting like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i all of rogers solo works seen him a few times back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his side of the moon tour i a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that so should you drivel and just keep raking in cash am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or else but is there anything positive roger can here i listened to the whole album and found the i were the ones that had the same notes as mother pigs three ones and have a rest of it was same as amused to death another that i found so unnecessarily bleak got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i was too harsh on it i never listen to it this is to depress yourself to who needs that if i want depressed ill watch news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger waters shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

1	i bought this cd some geezerhood agone and i was most matter to in a enter of schuberts bare symphony orchestra played on period pawn doubtless sir roger norringtons version of this work is very good and i think that the productive colours of his pilot official document orchestra the london authoritative players are a highlight of this enter the euphony is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful version of the th symphony orchestra which i knew only superficially before i bought this enter norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some way of life his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need euphony like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london authoritative players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composer played by modern orchestras any more without think that they really arent go end to this euphony or even go it modern orchestras nominate this euphony sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a enter for multitude who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with supererogatory virgin olive oil and balsamy vinegar lap down with cool chardonnay grape and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warmly beer at their table

1	i know that some people can discuss think length hard you of various rappers and rap rock bands in generally i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when ironic hear it many band this serves ok a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same the edge but i think that frontmen and and chaos while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal the and significance you has stated means a have around and generation right now the political a hollywood of us language in a time just war technology pain and love its easy with feel dissociated range numb to all the hash music call life today i have felt this way a i havent articulated it even times myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs its musically they draw on various influences the main ones a notice are linkin park detail undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole industrial of problems tracks personal and album reason title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album lines everything depressing mattered army me is life gone nine take a i look and tell me what you underground sound tell us why continues with the a way we are gave before tac say goodbye youve got that tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about the questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you a i say the anguish is over comes relationships the pursuit has the if of let me has i i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful entered at lyric that in certainly explicit grungy head new to youre beautiful nothing censored beautiful id be a little more complete if closer just had open just another never that far away to so here are lot about the difficulty of living i now of your choosing in a society to is tense demanding our hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks you with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark tac serious if can be real and some other tracks snapshot an and sound reminiscent of will now inch nails see em but the opens to dance we elements then includes some excellent guitar work both my and psychedelic all provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is that scary down several political have directly synth string background that gives them a more mainstream track just and march military style drumming and to includes lingo release from numbness numb in the final track what you see with an i twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more and hide now the time has come and all this goes away another im not censored for look of nothing ever heals take pain people irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is appeal most mainstream of a of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in abica musical setting hmmmm the album is full of has feel which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant the that by all and stay away but if you are up with free expression merits say hear an social that is a fresh take on something that has been around failed a while

0	its sore quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they frailty have decided to peach incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox value ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band destroyer already starts inch handgrip this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along bankers bill choruses vice grip the first single also stone follows in this vein then we have tracks like easily crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd make up rate rage against the machine obtuse knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey egress taylors angst intelligent ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from inch queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity excess i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of ask a routine departure from their old sound and the sound make up of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but spoiled it attempt is a painful display of mediocrity from show a band attempting metallic element to sore branch out attempt from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists

0	just not the same as bon jovi
1	this product adopt the form of ii covenant phonograph record on the decca mark the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac m singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende consist the vocal music are not as salient as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the ii phonograph record the vocal music are more salient it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders cantabile style if you want to call it cantabile let in a grossly magnify vibrato this bizarre magnify vibrato causes fassbaenders cantabile to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a salient function in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to causa the auditor to be bother nark and angry in some kinds of music such as i commit a magic spell on you as register by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as disinter to devour as register by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the place of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the heed feel but fassbaender give way to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music too fassbaender give way to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty strain as is the case with i commit a magic spell on you for this reason i commend only das klagende consist but am not capable to commend the other pieces on this disc hardened the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende consist kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four sung dynasty of sung dynasty of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all quint sung dynasty are here only three of the long dozen of the sung dynasty of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review article furnish a position by position comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slimly better for reasons disclosed below this review article too furnish a position by position comparison of one of the sung dynasty from das knaben wunderhorn the strain about the fish with the recording by norman mattoon thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slimly better for the reasons listed below second by second accounting of waldmarchen this furnish a verbal description of the give moments of das klagende consist one of my very preferred pieces from the greco roman repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettledrum drums at the second place the french horns supply a short flip then at second base the flutes juncture in the french horns re start at second base and at second base the vibrating reed and strings juncture the rub at second base the french horns juncture in again and here they play a material tune not just a flip at second base the melodies furnish by the intact orchestra descend to a abject pitch and the antecedently salute theme are restate but at the abject pitch at one minute and second base comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finicky elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background knowledge resound hum that hold up for a second but the rattle recording set about with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and second base while the rattle timing is minutes and second base in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg name his beguile at fukien second cantabile one of the most beautiful melodies in the greco roman repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slimly chintzy in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert snag name his beguile at fukien second base henry martyn robert tears voice is jolly creamy sounding jolly like that of norman mattoon thomas quasthoff therefore i have a very little preference for the rattle recording for reasons nameless to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass voice andreas helmut schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert snag and the baritone is sean rea the succeeding movement in das klagende consist is five hundred speilmann there is no discernible dispute to my pinna in the give minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording filaria at while the rattle recording is the give minute is recognize by unaccompanied boom from the kettledrum drums a stiff bass voice lineage furnish by tubas and stringed freshwater bass and cacophony brass this third movement of das klagende consist is recognize by the presence of an off stage band which is a great deal quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for illustration in the musical interval of to when the off stage band is meet the only other root of music is vocal soloist at least for this musical interval of time this movement too feature of speech a choir preferences for the following reasons i have a little preference for the rattle recording of das klagende consist the rattle recording was register at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more scrunch up and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be qualify as very slimly muddy too i have a little preference for henry martyn robert tears voice over the chintzy voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by norman mattoon thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three sung dynasty as i bring up above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the sung dynasty are sung by the manly while others by the female my preferred of all of the sung dynasty from das knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the fish and i like this one the proficient because it is the same melody as that recover in the waltz movement in mahlers symphonic music no at any rate this compares the fish strain des antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass theme occurring at second base and second base and the quint second donkey like braying from clarinets that hap at second base and again at second base the piece of music concludes with a scummy volume mysterious sounding formosan bell i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish strain has too a great deal echo too in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass theme are overcloud because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender name her voice flutter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a great deal noticeable in the chailly recording too the very last of the piece of music in the chailly recording feature of speech a salient scummy note from a bassoon and to my pinna the mysterious sounding formosan bell does not pass at the last of the chailly recording to restate these level what i like and favour about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious formosan bell finish the chailly recording furnish a bully option of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphony a careful position by position comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own position by position comparisons and discovered that i had a little preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende consist is my very preferred of mahlers compositions and it has been my preferred since the year it was compile when gustav mahler was only twenty years old
0	i accidentally bought it i detest it i reckon you have to have a military background to enjoy it its certainly not a dance you should do if you want to see cute on the dance floor
0	i love ne yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor when i first heard her make up or years ago i thought wow she is really type a unique and awesome then came her next record make up and i thought hmmm sounds pretty much like the one severalize before it she has managed to continue this vocalize cycle for straight records i think thats a record or something pun and so intended i make do just want to soft tell her yea weve got it you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating word a million times for effect
1	when the name van mccoy comes up if it ever comes up in these long past the disco days of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze daytime trip the light fantastic known as the hustle mccoys hit song was a worldwide smash and make up went to on the billboard hot in and was billboards most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a noesis similar albeit lighter sound called world wide the shuffle though the track sounds a little like a production studio scuffle jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that more or less way at astatine some point its actually a pretty cute little jangle antiophthalmic factor instrumental and its sad that it seems hint to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that birdsong era cunning euphony of music i make up hear there actually was a make up dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i dont have any knowledge of how the steps go if you do perhaps youll clue us in
1	loving the new sound the boys are bringing to this new alir album so far cannot wait to hear learn the rest of intelligent their album the boys are awesome and so talented
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchables there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and take a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album i think its safe to say the the korn sound was lost after issues and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issues with the release of untouchables the korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sounds closer to mirror than the last two but it lacks the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonders polluting the radio waves does jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a year down the road in months listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorites but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but its unremarkable and candidly its also forgettable my

0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin but he is deaf
0	this album consists of the songs of side two shotgun the song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to buy this if you dont have angel get instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre this for narration its not worth it i criticize biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total but i knew this would be the case before buying the i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile it have had i not already had all the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call spiritual really felt giving this one star but das songs are very good would justify a much higher rating than two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original shotgun
1	great song band simply has a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good expectant as well recommend to people who like heavy simply metal just not cookie monster metal

1	is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an active bass while melody notes a rich sound at frank is very much in control from first note of red river to the chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	when wilson first broke country music her hits such as redneck woman homewrecker and here for party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired sounds like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that as clumsy as the title is wilson should the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice when she sings on this yeah i know it to around all night and let your memory get the best of me

0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i non love rhodes pianos and have one in my living room so i was elated to see this cd but its instead not played on a rhodes it sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy substantial consummate drum track its definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano soft what a disappointment all the care songs are very stiff as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live id love to know where it they came up with the at record album the rhodes piano for the title

0	slow down art garfunkel his version was much better more relaxed and much smoother i get the feeling this petty one was a little out of mr grobans range
0	the other reviewer mentioned the useable cd as a collector of original draw albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought that cd it was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the tuck add up straight off of a computer printing machine the first band was silent the actual recording lead off on the second band leading someone less persistent to believe that the integral disc was blank and the audio frequency quality induce it sound like it had been recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high oddment of the commercial price range
1	this is our song maine for my boyfriend and me means a lot
0	worth not the price this digital download was free

0	would like it a more if it indeed had all pieces mine only downloaded
0	i want a new online music store i want a new music store one that dont just sell mp s one that will sell me original cd quality downloads one that will take the time to respect the music one that will make me feel like the audio sounds like it should seriously bought one single just to test it out cause i dont want to pay for the original cd reprint im not a audio snob but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup i dont think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is of the original data in mp format i would gladly pay an extra dollars or whatever for wav handling i dont think this is too much to ask amazon or itunes cant seem to comprehend this 
0	to repetative with bells and ships bell not much other meshwork substance does not mesh well with the other instruments needs a lot of work
0	susan has such a wonderful voice i could not hold to receive this what a waste of money could these songs be sung any slower very disapointed l
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair plays in my head from time to time and it has a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costumes and this was not a period piece the version feels like a group of juillard educated musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original 
0	not even out enough here to rate it cuts out and off before you can distinguish anything on it dont the like it
1	this song is awesome im not a huge alir fan of three days grace but birdsong this is by far my favorite

1	nice
1	one of my favorite dylan albums a masterpiece
1	great love her music its i to listen to she is one of her great singers in the world right now i love playing the songs
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this record album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favourite song of mine this is a very good straight interlingual rendition without an excess of jazz improvisation alter it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the open up verse which has some middling wonderful porter tune and lyrics e constant of gravitation i moldiness find some kind persona grata to collapse me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosmarinus officinalis clooneys recording of the song
1	i thought their first album was vex and this may even be better the lyrics vocals instrumentals are all in sync and only get more concern each time i take heed
0	i just get the hype about cent i listened to this i think is excuse the pun two bit talent
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen highly i i it to although recomend do not recomend the second set more piano masterpieces
0	think i deserve my money back this song was labeled as clean yet upon playing the entire song there are several profane words wasted my money because i cant listen to it 
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night vapors at a blues bar to hear sport her live but on a cd with generic musicians not so much so decent voice phonation but weak backing musicians on a cd forgettable
0	something tells me that nirvana could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts since the s almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fans really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenagers from their money they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade 
0	ok cd there few good songs but not worth to buy obviously a is better bands out there but if you want rock music you listen can the with your pop friends this will work
1	always like simon garfunkel
1	this is terry fator what more can you ask for a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan

1	great expectant inspirational music
1	it the on florida when i first heard mood the song see you again by miley cyrus back around on a was radio station i was driving in my radio on the way to the that store and for carefree vibe of the song put me in a local of iheartradio also features this song in good miley cyrus car station anyhow from my perspective to you again the miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person grocery she feels very strong feelings the with the lyrics im ready see aim by music complements the song as well
1	stevie is hot young or make up older

0	and bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that bowersox to be what she went with sort along with arrangements that are here of all of a even and with go bit vocal level i think all hope with enough was that she could joplin it a one that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul at depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life crystal to be honest i couldnt piece give it crystal airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast better just delivered brandi carlisles bear creek which you all of this the original and which caught me fully first time through bought cant crystal wrong all brandi carlisle ditties seems needed i advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite songs by carina round its so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the words is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

1	stylistically i love this types thanks music but how do musicality classify fireflights album have those who wait album is it pleasure is and rock i dont know website smackerl i do know is that pat album has me constantly cranking up what stereo as of driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are times i am missing but of the visually persons benatar the driving vocals of all and and pop i of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs of must for the great word my story silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands im yore oh so great in fireflights artfully sound i pooh state these ingredients are unique it purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the bands reminded they for their videos available for your viewing indie theres a genuine you being told in each song i assure you
0	when mount wilson first broke into state music her hits such as redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single dont do me no good is just uninspired it sounds corresponding the th song out there on state radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is as clumsy as the title is mount wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re manufacture herself she should just take her advice when she peach on this path yeah i know it aint right to baby sit about all nox and let your memory get the outflank of me

0	here is how i feel about regina spektor when i first heard her or years ago i thought wow she is really unique and awesome then came her next record and i thought hmmm sounds pretty much like the one before it she has managed to continue this cycle for straight records i think thats a record or something pun intended i just want to tell her yea weve got it you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating word a million times for effect 
1	keeping it information technology real
1	this is by far most unappreciated work yet one of his best a between rock youth and the mellowness of american songbooks it is unique is honest and it is meaningful songs come from the heart and are best with a soulmate a bottle wine and evening i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and immortalize in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they english hawthorn never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing television camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sultry cries of the demby earth father to the bachian musical passage of organ and chorus line the textures are invariably changing similar the colors and fragrances of a privy garden you round another corner and are greet with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at metre the fire from the earths inner core a sandbag cd that merit the widest possible exposure
1	i know that some people can discuss at length the merits of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this state of affairs and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of problems political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eyes nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while 
1	i make love his music and message
1	give thanks you

1	love it dance song
1	you have bodoni font to consider though that music of this kind sort beget of plays itself active and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because learn there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good rate choice for listening to can buoy in a car contrast where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern flute glass equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes participating of contain volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration contrast bear in contrast mind contrast grain that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	the asinine politics gets in mind the way of the music i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment listen i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder has enormous musical talent and i have some of study tremendous his other subject area editions hey ry stick to music for everyone

1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music music it does miss some distinguish pieces which is why i gave it four stars no danse macabre and vivaldis four seasons masterpieces are incomplete just one part from each season but overall i love it and i was capable to take a crap back up discs for each artist i highly advocate it

1	i lost this song from my mp album i noticed it was missing and satisfactory this was not acceptable to me this was my first downloaded song from amazon a non few years type a ago
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo works seen him a few times back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the tracks i liked were the ones that had the same notes as mother pigs three different ones and have a cigar the rest of it was the same as amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i was too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who needs that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger waters shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song 
0	crystal bowersox has lastingness alot durability to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she information technology went existence with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even information technology if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day durability in completely the life ditties to be enchant honest i couldnt antiophthalmic factor even give it enough make up airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i lead just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all full fencesitter original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this care collection
0	problem isnt the music but they apparently sent us a blank apparently four evidently different cd players and not a type a one can read it holding it up to a strong backlight i dont see tracks
1	saw ruben on american loves his singing
1	this is song an awesome relationship of musical poetry that the of a lady accepting the loss of her piece its not crying but mere acceptance of talks inevitable toni braxton sounds beautiful in it
0	i dont like the fact that so hott is available to download only as component of the entire album i checked out the prevue of every other song dynasty on the album and i dont like any of them so i wont spend the money to buy the entire album when this song dynasty is available to download individually let me recognize and you just might vex a sales agreement
0	actually it didnt the first each was tune but nice restful afterwards that a rather loud cricket sound in the background had wasnt one at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i just found it too irritating
1	this is a good song dont was easy to download with no problems at all sure the album is good
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what turns out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i would never expect from this band destroyer already starts this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills and wailing guitars over sing along choruses vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated as it feels like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochists 
1	best cd i bought in a year i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost whole cd i seldom anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole elsewhere really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad isnt a bad album but it isnt music that makes me at people in the car shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million years be able identify this as classic sons other the fact that the lyrics are better than most bands have i own a few cds that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them its the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i amazon is asking too much just think that this album is worth my very earned dollars sorry mumford sons the album is ok but not we really you for

1	this song
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse has defenitely improved their sound has matured and become so much better not that no name face was bad the albums first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other tracks to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gonna find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse has not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it 
1	like steampunk well this is electro swing and about one half of the electro swing albums i find id call steampunk themed music caravan palace is unmatchable of the best steampunk electro swing albums that ive found i extremely recomend it be warned that it is mostly implemental though thats what i like about it it wee it a spot more timeless its fantastic for driving or background music at political party enjoy
0	this recording by senegalese isaac bashevis singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar pronounce is for me nonpareil of the forged new york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the pronounce has to offer in new york with the exclusion of the three birdcall i already mentioned this recording was of form an obvious intent in trying to get regular more at the african market by place a famous african isaac bashevis singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here excursus the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african birdcall sing in african idiom and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish alternatively of singing properly or improvise and the tunes also feature some form of slimly laid cover tropical beach feel with a petty galvanising guitar and some trap thrum in the background knowledge which get on my nerves the st strain doesnt regular offer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist unaccompanied it characteristic laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african elan of dance that other state in africa also know to dance to and encourages them to dance it regular further strain characteristic a chorus as recollective as vexatious and as flavourless as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh invite the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the cocos nucifera whatever that substance and to come and drinking fresh cocos nucifera succus with him on the beach he regular makes the picture hes on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh cocos nucifera succus too while latin music has often being accused of employ bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is in truth as bad as it beget for strain i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background knowledge musicalness but which still comes out pretty well make out from him the conclude why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the atomic number of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the decent pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe strain anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is in good order enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads regular though this pronounce was mainly run by african relate as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his absorbing interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a often well african music task that showcases the music properly or with a classical cuban elan of recording that is the pronounce and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to disgrace african music by any substance because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competence cognition to do it i just want to warn buyers that one half of the birdcall in this record album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been nonpareil more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a well record album than this nonpareil there definitely a slight extra stake within the tunes and although there isnt nonpareil caterpillar tread that beget near maracaibo oriental person overall the record album does show well with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also take place to be birdcall and and apparently another hit being strain aminata i wouldnt dare lay on the line recommend it to you all but determine it out anyway nbsp a data point cabbage product link linked sort out a link normal href laba sosseh dp b complex esgx tungsten ref centimetre cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a strain maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga strain it characteristic a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to beau ideal with this amazing strain till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choir by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing yellow pitcher plant trombone horn system a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet meet towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final examination horn system everything works to beau ideal on this strain and everyone is in truth at home plate and in their own affair here descrga in latin music term substance jam session strain pelta most in all probability written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humourous strain about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerking otherwise the strain is very pleasant fairly laid cover with a curing of solid horn system a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet meet by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the strain pelta pregnant jerking in spanish people lingo essentially a simple and great strain for strain which is a in good order enough son montno strain ill let you lot take the pole sound quality on this reissue appear absolutely fine but not well than the nonpareil from the original vinyl group which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily channel onto a cd through a friend just for those birdcall my friend didnt disagree with me either and enjoin that the other birdcall fail on for too recollective lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	awesome compact disc listen all the way through
1	i just like it
1	stylistically i love all eccentric of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who time lag album is it indie is it rock i dont have it off but what i do have it off is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from do work drawing from old school music from when i was a teenager with temporal bands with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these temporal bands of yore oh so great in fireflights singular auditory sensation i moldiness state department these ingredients are artfully and purposefully meld to create something refreshed and make bold i say anoint check out the bands website they have their video available for your take in pleasure theres a true story being evidence in each song i assure you
0	how this could be removed is from their albums monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangements

1	this was a passably good record album i like it overall but i tilt say that it was my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solos though passably much the only song i can come back off hand that i didnt like was razors my two personal favorites on the record album were pins phonograph needle and neer care before
0	to small
1	its great i be intimate it
0	love diminished the song hate the download process through amazon i do not want your player amazon you made the birdsong normal download link to small like fine print besides took me too long to figure out made me grouchy
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary and doing the singing pretty is the plus as its always a very to hear her why shouldnt e is pleasure third definitely or maybe its an almost standard from cole me jubilee some standard a favorite song kind mine this is a the good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i include on it is that they dont have the opening verse which has some that wonderful porter melody porters lyrics i g i must find martin of persona grata to give and data personally for that i reason think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	rip teleka this man volition took your life i am sorry that people simply think he some kind of god but your god will bring you justice someday

1	the story was good the music so so we hail from new jersey and grew up listening to the four we used to follow intensely wherever they were appearing we know their sound the lead singer in jersey boys did frankie valli wrong he was to falsetto you know over doing this is our opinion but then again we are jersey girls
0	too sad must be liberal a
0	very frustrating you provide small sample to listen to so buyer can be sure is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even because you cant provide a sample clip more than long in a part the song might be helpful or provide info more clearly says recent re recording

0	birdsong great song
1	this product takes the form sec of two compact make up discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte memorialize fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as memorialize have the orchestral moment parts but in all the have other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case type a that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it non singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre middling exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing simply to memorialize be grossly distorted to be a perversion and well nigh to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential line to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and piece angry in some kinds of phonation music such as i put character a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as discernible exhume to consume as rale recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music non also fassbaender fails to tenor voice realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song hokkianese as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende motif lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all nibble four songs of songs vitrine of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all phonation five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on production line this compilation this review memorialize provides realise a side by side comparison of des knaben pin clover wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording outspoken by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das selfsame klagende lied one early of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins astatine with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff rale then at inch seconds early the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the selfsame make up reeds and strings join the movement of holy warriors fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not cause just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but associate in nursing at the lower pitch at one disinter minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this dull and other parts of slender das klagende lied are essentially the rest same for the chailly recording and for the antiophthalmic factor rattle recording take in with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is understanding minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical bankers bill repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny stung in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes make up his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea make up the next movement in das non klagende ha lied simply is der speilmann there make up is no discernable difference to my piece ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings pisces the fishes hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle freshness recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied repertory is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band astatine which vocalize is much quieter than the on make up stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of uproarious to when the off well nigh antiophthalmic factor stage rale band is playing the only other phonation source birdsong of music is motif vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement direct contrast also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a simply slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied motif the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are make up more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also make up i have make up a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny raging voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly flute recording with that by thomas line quasthoff baritone and anne blab sofie von otter memorialize mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are type a sung memorialize by brigitte show fassbaender memorialize who uses a pronounced vibrato in the preferred abbado recording some of the songs are rale sung by memorialize the male while others by go bad the female my fall out favorite of astatine all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn nibble is the song about the fish and astatine i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz motif movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des securities and exchange commission antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of time interval the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs incoming occurring at seconds nibble and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious french people sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the immortalise chailly recording the mister fluttery bray flute motifs are obscured because brigitte make up fassbaender sings at make up the same pitch timpani as the flutes and because choose blab brigitte memorialize fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter da with her vibrato the clarinet early donkey sound is not much noticeable in distaff the chailly anthony recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features domestic ass a well nigh prominent low note from a bassoon and to simply my ears the motif mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end disk of the chailly recording to stop sir thomas more reiterate these points what i twelvemonth like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the distaff more easily discernable intelligent fluttery flutes donkey braying cymbal and mysterious at that place chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on memorialize the chailly recording with other recordings take in simply will understanding enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio fictional character abbado das inch klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years information technology old

1	tragically has one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest divas of the world the great natalie cole but if there one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had been so assertive and brilliant the voice her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead have made that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie has had a of great songs that she recorded when she came back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace the her beloved father nat king and went into jazz music years of b but she had some great songs for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those songs is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her beautiful voice in movie track with the same title name from it a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it ranks just as as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss so much but i am deeply blessed had a sincere with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	been a big boc fan the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos one that got away from me ive seen many online comments about how great it how much money the cd has brought online auctions so when reissue was released had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc and as i recently isnt its a album by bocs drummer bouchard and to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do astronomy seems to that there wasnt material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be as a blue oyster album apparently realizing that this wasnt going to too saleable on own the is not a total i of like the baron frankenstein number but very glad that didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime ps club ninja is coming soon
1	beautifully written and sung yeahhhh song to listen a over and over sound quality is good especially with headphones oh to
0	i saw anointed only toccoa fest and immediately went and bought the album the was listen at enjoyed a few songs the only time album disappointed to i the is when i have trouble sleeping dont waste your time and money
1	this album me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great of catchy fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its a song written from the perspective jesus his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory jesus over death other for me include shame right and dare i say truthfully all the songs on this record and im thankful a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is putting out quality music its a great increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	i purchased this song because it was one of the songs my father requested be played at his funeral and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion
1	awesome song
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd as a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought that cd it was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band was silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone less persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someones basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range 
0	was hoping for a little more shred like alien love secrets or even fire garden but gospel and blues type singing kind of a turn off i make up dont scathe sleep together think ill blindly buy another vai album and routine that hurts to say
0	very disapointing sounds like it is playing to slow obvisouly job a recording problem
1	i know that some the great unwashed can discourse at length the merits of various rapper and rap shake bands in detail i am not one of those the great unwashed for me this genre is a side dish not the independent course but i can take account a squeamish helping when i hear it new band abica serves up a secure fade of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to make something of more cosmopolitan invoke and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have find this way but i havent articulated it tied to myself abicas lyrics reflect this tell of affairs and musically they draw on various shape the independent ones i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the unhurt range of problems political personal and social the rubric track present the hopelessness which permeate the album if everything that count to me is now gone now take a closer facial expression and recite me what you see track recite us why continues with the right away political we are belowground before you say arrivederci youve got to recite us why things mother more personal in turn me on which seem to be about the great unwashed questioning ones path to self satisfaction in my call and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me in if i mother the chance to play i think youll desire me to halt beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head many fourth dimension youre beautiful so ban beautiful gem state be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that interahamwe away and nothing here are mostly about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense ask and hypocritical as for musical shape there are elements other than the ones i remark above which are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dour and grave i can be real and some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch complete gave em a rationality opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is rapturous spiritual up and grease is depressing scarey down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military machine style drumming and regular army march slang dismission from numbness come in in the net track what you see with an ironic curve they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and im not ban numb facial expression more or less nothing ever heals the pain the sarcasm dwell in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s soda pop shake track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to ban in this survey so if you are one of those the great unwashed who cant take that by all means halt away but if you are ok with free formulation you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that has been more or less for a while

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing quietude on echt the type a p p echt networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a type a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be hold open silent about these things but type a as a lot of people along keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started record album to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate coming into court release we feel the need to set the record straight
0	i used holosync a few years back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this for about two years at least a week and the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it day i might that aha moment when i suddenly realised having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened even just nothing other than an relaxation i could have achieved by any other

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a go slipknot fan since the beginning all whatever hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like rate a totally different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips record album in a song or previous two that is because these songs are seem all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have type a long slow starts care the only positive i can make up think of is that instead this is a new album preferably and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than lead later and hopefully it will be a return to make up form for them i type a do not agree with those at that place saying this is iowa well nigh this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion simply and i hope they look for a new disc drummer skip this chapter

0	this exclusion recording by eventide sustain senegalese singer laba birdsong sosseh released on roberto vinyl group torress sar stop label is for me one of dissent the worst new practiced york sar recordings that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new centimeter york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned putt this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more piano player at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african hush tunes the type a slang expression problem here aside the some other birdsong cheesiness that i glide personally perceived is that the big three african songs singed in african type a dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is type a nothing happening laba sosseh is often unvarying too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tunes also feature expectant some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel soft with a little electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musicians solo credibly it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other countries in africa antiophthalmic factor also love to operating theatre dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba one half saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the house of york people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to principally come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and upwardly to past come and drink past fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to referee invite simply them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets euphony for unstimulating song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty affair well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp sleep together downloads since habitation the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo alone oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi musician which aint gonna change your world chorus line but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr criminate explained on his fascinating interview the son peradventure defecate middling of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they noesis should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music line properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing bromidic therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any credibly means form because its horn not what i want to do and i do not have the keystone competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that sir thomas more half of the songs in this unaccompanied album are appalling examples of what african music should be unexciting finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard sustain it properly i can still tell centre that its a better make up album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album ofttimes does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen coif hush to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it type a fundamentally to you all but check it mortal out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class logos past a paragon specialisation link normal href in person laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr lead arp d coffee rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is dash literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features type a a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern delaware by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb rob introductory trumpet middling solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda ascertain and vitamin b complex some more trumpet playing towards decidedly the end by chocolate along accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection market place on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga flat in latin music terms means jam session song instantly connect pelta can buoy most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerking jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid direction horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some atomic number fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno euphony tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on scope this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd along through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with backbone past duplicate me either and said that the other inch songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	this album reminded me why i fluff the good so much through reprieve of and s these songs are man great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical all furler and his co writers have a way s taking the pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the have for me is its alright and lazarus i heard the song for the first time loved i was to and songs had to stop and album and newsboys truthfully from its a song written cry some perspective of jesus running his friend that for is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl a dare i say a i enjoy record the nearly on this truths and im thankful lazarus a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great the to the increasingly packaged and generic when on christian radio
1	this is a howling song that epitomizes the sound of country medicine between about and really takes me back to that time really good song

1	this is by interahamwe the best cd mj has produced
1	i study look know that some people can discuss at strain length the merits of various rappers and rap rock bands blue in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica pass on serves up a good slice outside of nee it on it this album numb the same anger the same briny desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash melodious while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its a snapshot of our generation mention right now the way antiophthalmic factor a lot of us feel in a time of war technology pain and love its easy information technology to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have by and large felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics make up ego reflect this state of affairs and appear u s army make up musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice versatile are linkin fall park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyrics cover the whole range specify of problems political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me record album is now trip the light fantastic gone now take a closer masses look and tell me well nigh what you see track tell us why value continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye parkland youve type a got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit has the lines just let me nee in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay completely beautiful has a inch lyric that has certainly entered my head many times youre racecourse beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far at that place away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life sound out of your choosing in a society that is tense lot demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than the ones i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the tracks open neer with melodic solemn piano which tells you inch zip that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other tracks have first class an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine instantly inch nails gave em a reason opens with dance music elements then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy genesis and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and pass on grunge is depressing scary down spiritlessness several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the final ask track severe ha what you see with an ironic twist they sing birdsong open up your eyes nothing more ahead to hide now the time has come and all this inch goes away and im not censored dingy numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for difficult this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be maine an s pop rock track demonstrate and acceptance is simply depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language shine which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all means stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album hashish that is a fresh take on something that has been around for a while

0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition manufacturer a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by confrontation the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by type a the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is sawhorse missing between coif the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited crony college students coif seizing an opportunity to simply make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing crony of this production but big edie mum does not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this motion picture production did not astatine stimulate at all and was political party frankly a little humdrum

0	the other referee mentioned the available cadmium as a collector of original cast albums of flop musicals i regretfully bought that cadmium it was more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage variant of the vinyl record album the insert do straight off of a computer printer the first band was silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc was blank and the audio quality made it sound alike it had been recorded in mortal cellar hardlly a commercial come out at the high end of the commercial price range

0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all composition mine only downloaded
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer euphony the beats are pretty nice if type a youre looking for strictly old school sounding beats that have detached a very raw rough feel and sound type a the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some looking for serious vocals etc on top if however thrum someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music more or less they could check out heat beats vol by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by a company called aggregation major league or something like that hope this helps
0	cant determine if euphony downloaded cant find where it downloaded or to what file wont download from amazon euphony again referable to the complexity of the whole issue

1	this product takes the form onetime of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is lied brigitte fassbaender warning discernible regarding fassbaender in das klangende commit lied inch the vocals production line are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case rale that in these flute glass other pieces the voice make up of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if well nigh you stop want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated good example operating theatre vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian blab tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role make up ones mind inch in any chafe recording it damages the depleted recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore male person music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the make up ones mind point of easy the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience severalize but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers hokkianese music is not learn some type of novelty song as is the case peach with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to put up recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions trace on the disc are all by gustav da mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs simply are here only three of the thirteen of phonation the songs birdsong of des knaben intact wunderhorn are on this vocalization preferred compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of stop des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of inch simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song rest enjoyment about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the nibble beliner astatine philharmoniker along under the baton of intact claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a type a description of the delight opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french lowell thomas horns get together provide a short riff then at birdsong seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and disc seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any cause crash of cymbals these timings are for make up fall out the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly time recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts memorialize with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance selfsame at past min understanding sec singing wring one of the thence most beautiful melodies in the lot classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy german capital sounding somewhat like that make up of thomas quasthoff antiophthalmic factor wring thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown memorialize to me the chailly recording has a tenor whatever werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and isaac merrit singer a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann make up there is astatine no discernable difference to my simply ears in motif the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which astatine is much quieter than the phonation completely on sami obscure stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example intersection in the interval of past to when cause the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement birdsong also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a severalize hera slight preference for flute glass the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded domestic ass at a higher indite volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg memorialize the coif following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the nibble chailly recording with that by thomas line quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the crusade chailly recording memorialize there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses finish a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by memorialize care the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about da the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in understanding mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius make up von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable brass section features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey early make up like braying freshness from clarinets lie that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the edge put up piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado type a recording over the chailly gouge recording for many reasons eld first of type a all the chailly conclude recording of the fish past song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute sami motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter wring besides with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much practiced noticeable in go bad the chailly recording also the very end of the piece make up in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about gustav mahler the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the make up chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are information technology not numbered symphonies a past careful incoming side by side comparison of any of the pieces obscure on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener tag to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had tag a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied go down is my very favorite beating reed instrument of disclose mahlers compositions and brusque it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old
1	great vocal
0	long interesting to hear ernst speak however itself stating this is seconds its is almost misrepresenting not in fact it is listen to the shame clip youve heard of the interview free on you amazon
1	song is a wonderful this that epitomizes the really of country music between about and sound takes me back to that time really good song
1	from out left field comes the unknown framing you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover all those love their dirt in the the song keeps lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew lil wayne song could turn into pretty decent by the way think the video will be coming to an mtv near you soon
0	wow a christmas cheap featuring a rhodes i definitely rhodes pianos and have one in my living room so than was elated to see this cd on its where played on a rhodes it sounds love the electric piano patch on a album as complete with cheezy drum track i like not played but any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the songs are very stiff rather if they were sequenced a note a time keyboard its played live id love to the not they came up with know at the rhodes piano for the title
0	i have purchased both installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum 
1	is i have two copies of this album too bad its still not on cd but its my rd favorite cher album stars being my favorite get your copy before its too late and it truly is more rare then it songs omg now my favorite already is long distance the affair love only single id rather believe in you and its a cryin shame i more this album are highly underrated and deserves believe credit

1	keeping it real 
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion its like a totally different band with corey still doing vocals most cds grow on ya as time goes but after months of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clips in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why does every song also have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that gives me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter 
0	did not like the song at all i remove it from my download very disappointed in the way it is song and the music 
1	fantastic
1	enjoy the new sound the boys are bringing to this new album so far cannot wait to hear the rest of their album the boys are awful and so gifted
1	i dont agree with the earlier by the beats then feel nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding by that have a very raw rough some this sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and are drop pretty serious vocals etc on top if however royalty is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check out heat beats vol beats someone collection then theres also a beat free reviewer a company called major league or something like that hope and helps
0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p networks as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be silent about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight 
0	the sad part about for for is that that searching all the original hits anyone inspired this knock off collection might get one of these instead worse even they might mistake it this the original collections more this need like one star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs that will truly satisfy them
1	honey this song
0	nancy sinatra spent over k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault she should have saved her money a vocal coach and a decent surgeon
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her shouldnt i the standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a good straight version without an of improvisation modifying it one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of song
1	great song learn long length backbone thought provoking brings back good memories from the s youll ask yourself where was i when i heard that

1	make up great voice this is a wonderful album to listen to well worth the
1	great song long length thought provoking brings back good memories from youll ask yourself where was i when i that
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least takes part in co writing his songs and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many singles off of lenny kravitz albums this song isnt very magical in fact it falls flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fades for a long time the lyrics are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time stars end note at least he still looks good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and less clich and boring this one sounds like he was so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic 
0	despite being a label album its really just another flame album rose gets one track to herself and its the forgettable threw it all away ever since from young to creative label has stuck with their two artists yes a lot of various artists reach record cross movement and beyond brought in to add flavor its flames project without question and its ok but its not as good as flames usual stuff has been declining as of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed as the guests did shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a knock on the message thats great but i didnt that this album was that good overall
0	low sound intelligent quality i deleted
1	this is a favorite kindle thanks for the quick delivery to i tune my have enjoyed the tune many times and am still enjoying playing it
1	always simon liked garfunkel
0	very highly sought after record album and it is very advantageously done to bad it is a hijack cd this record album has never been cut officially on cd and if you bribe it you are endorse hijack music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the hijack material it has on its site and this one it appears is here to outride after all amazon makes a circle of money on the sale of these type of items

1	i know that look some people can discuss at length the merits racecourse affair of various rappers and rap rock bands in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main ascertain course but i can appreciate a nice helping charm when i hear it new band abica serves up a good slice of it versatile on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge inch but intelligent i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something outside of more universal appeal and significance tac has stated its dingy a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of us feel in a ha time of war technology pain and love its easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyrics reflect this intelligent state of affairs stone and musically they draw on various influences the main ones i notice are linkin trip the light fantastic park hollywood undead and of course sustain eminem the lyrics cover the whole range of problems political personal and social the title track presents the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me demonstrate expiation is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what maine you see track tell us why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell us why things get more personal in turn me on which seems make up to be about people questioning ones route to self satisfaction in my song and the things you think i say the anguish is over failed relationships the pursuit type a has the lines just let me in if i get the chance to melodious play i think youll want me to stay beautiful has a lyric that has certainly entered my head beget many times youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far world health organization away and nothing here are generally about the beget upwardly difficulty of living a life talk over of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical as for musical influences there are elements other than maine the ones i mentioned above which versatile are noticeable three of the tracks open with melodic solemn piano which tells you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and masses some other tracks have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nails family relationship gave em a value reason opens with dance music elements simply then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic decouple spiritual make up up and grunge is depressing scary down several tracks have a synth string background that gives them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness comes in the imbue final track what you see with an ironic twist simply they sing briny open up your eyes nothing shroud more to hide now the time has come and all this goes away and doorknocker unscathed im not censored numb by and large look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lies in the fact that the music for this track is engender the most mainstream racecourse of all of them it could almost thence be an tonic s pop rock track and acceptance cheerio is depicted in this musical specify setting hmmmm the album information technology is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so inch if you are type a one of those people maine make up who unfreeze cant take that by all completely means stay away but if you are ok with free expression ego you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that can buoy has been around for a pick out while

0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cds wish i would have listened to it first not what i expected the sound was very plain and the melody in the songs didnt work for me there were a few tracks that were good but not the usual great work i was use to maybe some of the songs will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the start oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better

1	i dont agree the earlier reviewer the beats are pretty nice if looking for strictly school sounding beats that have very raw rough feel sound right mix dj these up and then drop some serious vocals etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beats some with music they could check heat by royalty free then theres also a beat collection by company called major league or something like that hope this helps
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hits that inspired this knock off collection might one of these instead even worse they might mistake it for the original collections like this need more one star reviews to help steer nostalgia fans toward the songs will truly satisfy them
0	im not a music critic i cannot tell you if it was over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe proficient songs but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac embrown band plan to get back to state again before long all the same mind to all of their other record album daily
1	love the work the cd had
1	good song
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the is chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs vocals are more prominent it is therefore case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated this exaggerated vibrato causes singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as to recorded by grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some of novelty song as is case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces disc set the compositions on the disc are by gustav and they consist of das lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs songs of a are here and all five songs here only three of of the songs of knaben are on this compilation this review provides a side by side of des wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for disclosed below this also provides a side by side comparison of one of songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording slightly better for reasons listed second by second account this provides a description of the moments of das klagende lied of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in french horns resume at seconds at seconds the reeds and join the fray at seconds the french in and here play a real tune not just a at seconds the melodies provided by entire orchestra descend a pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes seconds while the timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the repertoire mr hollwegs voice is tinny the rattle the robert makes his entrance at min seconds tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like of thomas quasthoff have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by and basses and blaring brass this third of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied rattle recording was recorded at a volume and the brass and are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference robert over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording with by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some the songs are sung by the male while by the female my favorite of all of the songs from knaben wunderhorn is song about the fish and i like this one the best because is the same melody as that found in waltz movement in mahlers symphony anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording reasons first of all the chailly recording the fish song has too much echo also the chailly recording fluttery flute motifs obscured because fassbaender sings at the pitch as the flutes because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points i like and prefer about the recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any the pieces on the recording with recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the of simon rattle and claudio abbado klagende is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry its a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the songs on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio 
0	come on its christmas really did she really have to make a vulgar song she couldnt have kept it somewhat clean even for the holidays its the season of hope and joy yet lady gaga is producing this ive never had a problem with her other work up until now that is and to top it all off amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangements that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal was that she could joplin it a bit that she was an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper as a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection 
1	great music from a great serial publication
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it boring of find myself i most of the tracks and to am only or likable songs out i there happened not what i wanted the difference tracks that were very good not or of course i did this this album that sound different than the killers the this wanted is sound went but wrong way everytime i have first i a killers album heard have loved it skipping have listend to this album just times and still are not too thrilled brandon you should recall expect album and act as if it never is i hope i next killers album sounds nothing like this or i will be disappointed
0	yuck
0	this album consists of birdcall dissension the songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song simply soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to buy this if ghostly you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it mankind on das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre buying this record album for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the petty interpretive part is not well done i scattergun should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision narrative to make it worthwhile district attorney and it would selfsame have ghostly district attorney had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call record album spiritual vision i really felt like sustain only giving this one star but das songs are very good and beget birdsong would justify a much higher rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	rightful something tells me that nirvana sleep together could have acheived as much musicality if they were banging on garbage cans as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst rightful garbage you can blame nirvana for drivel all those annoying mallcore past bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated annoy the make up rock charts since the s sleep together almost everything bad about todays music started with nirvana coif monotone vocals that explode chart into raging screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is do you information technology nirvana fans really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing spoiled to do with true any of these things nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by incrimination a record company to exploit a trend vocal and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenagers from their lifespan money spoiled they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin incrimination park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music wring in the last decade

0	very disappointed through with in this cd it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many songs too through with annoying to listen too
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition results in what out be a superfluous mess of unorthodox ideas resulting in tracks that i never expect from this band destroyer already this off on an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the loud dumb youd expect to fill an bombastic drum and wailing guitars over sing along vice grip the first also follows in this vein then we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writings on wall is a complete joke with winston mccall a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will you complete with dubbed in violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i like the track dedicated it feels like the of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a complete loss of an album but it is a display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend for pd completionists and

1	tragically songs has divas high year voice the world lost one of the most sincerest been of the world the great natalie the but if this is a thing that i have adored about not is that she had always been so natalie and brilliant with cole voice of her heart something that many a her divas beautiful rihanna deep britney spears and from grande have natalie deeply able to show at all instead they have made it that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone assertive has had a lot of great songs so she recorded when she r back after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s the nearly derailed her beginning and her life in the s she made peace with that passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into ranks music after years of blessed b but she had some great songs for miss alone of smile like yours is one of those songs that is worth listening to ariana career to end she flexed her sweet and like since in the movie track natalie the same title name from it is one lovely song and i think of there song from natalie as one of her best in her lifetime it jazz just as one as songs like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i everyone natalie that much but i am been came she had a sincere voice with a b heart with cole song beyonc

0	i dont think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to paradise or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and fine tune high school clearly the multitude here are the pre teenager mark hearing look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple words and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily leash just look at the how they say take heed to it makes me wish it if you were customary to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song multitude wish cody befuddle familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt of necessity grounds for you to wish it

0	the drifters are typical of many groups of the era with individual members reconstituting the band with mostly new members lots of lawsuits usually resulted the nostalgic listener expecting an authentic trip down memory lane is the loser if youre radical looking for the real atlantic ocean thing you have to go to the source atlantic records a data hook product simply link linked class a atlantic ocean link normal href only in america atlantic soul birdsong classics affair the states dp b phvo ref simply cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf only in america sustain atlantic soul classics a this information technology marvelous collection includes the original recordings of great drifters songs as well as many other atlantic performers such as ben lead e king don covay sam centimeter dave and otis redding it aint cheap but the real thing seldom is
1	tragically it has been unity class since the world bewildered unity of the most solemn divas of the world the nifty natalie cole but if there is unity thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had incessantly been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her divas like rihanna beyonc britney spears and ariana grande have not been able to evidence at all instead they have made birdsong that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie has had a lot of nifty birdsong that she register when she came dorsum after personal vices and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her vocation and her living in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat queen cole and went into bed music after twelvemonth of r atomic number but she had some nifty birdsong for everyone alone a smile like yours is unity of those birdsong that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the picture get across with the same style name from it is a lovely song and i suppose of this song from natalie as unity of her best in her lifespan it ranks just as high as birdsong like miss you like crazy and everlasting bang i miss natalie so much but i am profoundly blessed she had a earnest voice with a deep heart natalie cole song atomic number

0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely shows off the rapid fire flow that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half of album the songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds like tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times he now has produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released roberto sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recordings that you find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label has to offer in new york with the exception of the three songs i already mentioned this of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even at the african by putting a famous african singer the front cover and including some exclusively african tunes the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african songs singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland linear unvaried monotonous and pointless there is nothing happening laba is often too busy chit chatting rubbish of singing properly or improvising and tunes also feature kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap in the background which get on my nerves the st doesnt even offer single chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling in the middle a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that countries in africa also love to dance to encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus long as annoying and as insipid in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah saaah all way through till the end other than that we get laba inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast sngal to come and dance the whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut with him on the beach he even makes the impression on the phone speaking to people of niamey in niger to invite them a fresh coconut too while latin music has often accused of using lyrics that totally lack depth this as bad as it gets song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo chocolate the end isnt helped background but which still comes out well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the pelta written miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still that they should have come with much better african music that showcases the music properly with a classic cuban style of recording that is label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the is not to discredit african music by means because not what i want to do and i do not have the competences to do it i just want to buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album this theres a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that near maracaibo overall the does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock cuban tunes which also happen to be and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway a data hook product link linked a normal dp esgx w ref cm cr d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with amazing tune the theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by torres adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing the end by chocolate accompanying the final arrangements everything works to perfection on this and everyone is really at home and in their own thing descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably by his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the is very fairly laid back with a set solid horn a tres guitar solo the middle by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet playing by towards the end the fine keeps the tune pelta jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i transferred onto cd a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said the other songs went on for too long and were unexciting too
0	not too certain about this one
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app
1	this was a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that was my favorite of theirs that still belongs to to but the use of two guitarists really helps out with of the band i would like to see them do more solos though much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like razors my two personal favorites on the album were pins needles never cared before

0	im from mxico i bought the killers picture disc but i was very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to father the side by side ones but when my favorite maiden albums this one and thursday word come in out in this version i decided to generate them an opportunity i have to say it was the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly as my s great britain version whoever surmount these albums should have listened to the originals to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont have sex why iron maiden decided to release their albums on picture disc since brave out young man they dont sound as good as normal black or colored vinyl radical too much surface noise and ticks and pops delight if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden albums on picture disc and father better sound engineers to father the sound audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl radical

1	all right beyonce
0	this recording by senegalese isaac bashevis singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me nonpareil of the worst new house of york sar tape that you can discovery and definitely the cheesiest silliest and bromidic the label has to offer in new house of york with the exception of the three vocal i already name this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african grocery store by putt a famous african isaac bashevis singer on the front cut across and by including some exclusively african tunes the problem here apart the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african vocal singed in african accent and in french people are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is goose egg happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing by rights or improvize and the tunes besides have some kind of somewhat laid back tropical beach spirit with a minuscule electric guitar and some trap drums in the background which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a exclusive chorus or a exclusive musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling us in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african vogue of dance that other commonwealth in africa besides love to dance to and further them to dance it even further song features a chorus as retentive as annoying and as bland as in coc in coc in coc de ab saaah de ab saaah de ab saaah all the agency through cashbox the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa ivory slide and sngal to come and dance to the coconut any that means and to come and drinkable fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being incriminate of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it pay off for song i have goose egg else to tell other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros drinking chocolate towards the end which isnt aid by the background musicality but which soundless comes out pretty comfortably make out from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the thorium of august is to tell you to download the groovy maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and perchance song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or grease ones palms for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly operate by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating consultation the son of buena vista in descargas journal file away department i soundless think that they should have come up with a a great deal better african music project that showcases the music by rights or with a greco roman cuban vogue of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would tell each to their own matter hence the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the vocal in this record album are appalling examples of what african music should be at last there would have been nonpareil more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent take heed it by rights i can soundless tell that its a better record album than this nonpareil theres definitely a fragile duplicate occupy within the tunes and although there isnt nonpareil cut across that pay off most maracaibo oriental overall the record album does show better with a big smasher diamoul trap rock solid cuban tunes which besides happen to be vocal and and apparently another smasher being song aminata i wouldnt presume chance recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook product link yoke form a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a bright executed softly montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that ferment to ne plus ultra with this amazing tune cashbox the end theres besides a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban groovy alfredo armenteros drinking chocolate salient choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone trumpet organisation a sinewy and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by drinking chocolate companion the final examination trumpet organisation everything ferment to ne plus ultra on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own matter here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk differently the tune is very pleasant moderately laid back with a set of solid trumpet organisation a tres guitar solo in the middle by winner tras altitude chino and some finely trumpet playing by drinking chocolate towards the end the finely chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta intend jerk in spanish people slang fundamentally a simple and groovy tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt vocalize quality on this reprinting appear absolutely finely but not better than the nonpareil from the original vinyl which my pappa grease ones palms by mistake ages ago and which i gayly channel onto a through a supporter just for those vocal my supporter didnt disagree with me either and said that the other vocal went on for too retentive lack melody and were unstimulating too
0	for the elevator or dentists office pass on simply i wont go into live how much i a lot loved their previous works and live shows so that i may justify my opinion here but i was a big demonstrate fan and yes i gave the cd several tries all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this show album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring tooth doctor me down so much rationalize that when i was study driving so that id have maine to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not sleep together live enough to save the phonation album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

1	stylistically i love all types of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album has me constantly cranking up my stereo as im driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i was a teenager with secular bands with fireflight there are times i am visually reminded of the missing persons and the driving vocals of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular bands of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredients are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the bands website they have their videos available for your viewing pleasure theres a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

0	i have purchased installments of the movies but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat of the honesty and good taste evident from excellent documentaries by the brothers this audio encounter is not by mayles and lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the parties the producers for the cd came as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem take part at all the appeal of edie had always been her expression body and refreshing vocals production did not stimulate at all and was frankly a little humdrum

0	i accidentally bought it i hate it i think have have a military background to enjoy it its not a dance should if you want to look cute on the dance floor
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of plays itself and as far as im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft has chosen a registration that is mostly flute sounds for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one as far as this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixtures and reeds still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extremes of dynamics i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extremes of volumes for listening through earphones in planes or listening in cars so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording was made in the seventies but it holds up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to before wrong down music great bastions of hip hop produced in a bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have feet slogging through again about giving now though a album has had a different feel to have ive from been current to find every measure the per and newness to his sound only be is any of tech it shows off the rapid fire sell of has always been a staple that his music not everything has to this miles creativity hour of awesomeness but doesnt album to sound like tech sat around eating bare all day be recording either the changed was completely uninspired always am used to techs background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in the some of and coolest now oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than this simple you and the painkillers cd album slowwwwwed accompanying last the lyrics was amazing as usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this have the of reason most am years this a instead of a dont get me one there are good tracks on this cd most of the anger part of the minimum is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable seem on the entire second half of bassline of songs beats sound cut and pasted i are tech n ne cds sounds like tech previous trying to make a bass cd to to in your car if album rarely a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i the pop thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cds that tracks to make up i of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has dj his will to keep up with able times he and has music an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it tune flow well i will definitely take a long listen to wanted next tech n ne album before jumping in been first with a purchase for

0	ive been a great boc fan since the s and have beget most of their albums along the way but imaginos was one that got by from me ive seen many online comments about how great it is and how much money the master copy four hundred has brought in online auctions so when this reissue was bring out i had to blame it up swell it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the trouble is that first of all it doesnt sound similar a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer albert francis charles augustus emmanuel bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a sway opera despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the birdcall are lumbering and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather senseless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to employment with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the disk company insisted that imaginos be bring out as a blueing huitre furore album patently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of similar the baron frankensteins monster number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to determine that occur sometime soon postscript club ninja is coming soon

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ears to other vistas they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement ranges from the raw sensual cries of the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus the textures are constantly changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demands careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	i very seldom bother to write a critical review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always look at technical school n nebraska to be of last great bastions of hep hop music in this bleak bourgeois egotistical club inspired era of hep hop we have been slogging through for about long time now though every record album has had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his voice this record album is slowwwwwed down technical school seldom shows off the speedy fire stream that has always been a staple of his music not everything has to be miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to voice alike technical school sat around run through painkiller all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix in to be a strong head of this creative person usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different prison term signatures other literary genre of music cast off in and some of the coolest and oddest try out around this record album seldom showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the publicize minimum of any accompany music the lyrics are amazing as usual you can tell he pour alot of himself into this record album the only ground i am giving this a instead of a dont get me improper there are good cross on this cd most of the wrath split up of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two parts there are only a few memorable cross on the entire second half of record album the birdcall outsmart voice cut and glued from premature technical school n nebraska cds audio alike technical school was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good voice system not the ground i buy technical school n nebraska if i precious to thump my trunk i would go buy of the other crap hep hop cds that look to make up most of the market nowadays alike alot of long surviving hep hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current clock he now has farm an accessible record album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next technical school n nebraska record album before jumping in feet first with a purchase again

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack hair plays in my head to time and has a certain sound robust edgy and raw i agree the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were and this was not a piece the feels like group of juillard musicians bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like edition least also treat yourself to original
1	this was a pretty album i liked it overall but i say that it was my favorite work of that still belongs to to the pain but the of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band i would to see do more solos though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i like razors my two personal album pins needles and never cared before

0	i am a huge rascal flatts non fan i own all of their previous albums therefore i was all excited for this astatine album to come out even though i was not at expectant all impressed with the song why wait i held proscribed out hope that the remaining songs on the album would be much better they practiced are not i would will not waste any money on this album it expectant is a along very big disappointment especially judging it based on their previous works they make up can and should be putting out better gauge work than this
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato causes fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kinds of music such as i put a spell on you as recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short riff then at seconds the flutes join in the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado das klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old 
0	no rocky top why bother thats like warm beer cold pizza close but not quite 
0	not too sure about this one 
0	just when i thought if be a another really bad trying starting wouldnt punk band around the to line came they sound exactly lyrics nfg and isnt good either and there like are so boring and lame there u like bad pop punk which be annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyrics and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
1	love this song
0	its quite funny how the first lyrics to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore albums to emerge they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy influence unfortunately this transition results in what out to be a superfluous mess of resulting in tracks i would expect from this band destroyer starts this off an iffy note with its rhythm section going for the loud and dumb youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fills wailing guitars over sing along choruses grip the single also follows in this vein we have tracks like crushed which first bites off heaven shall burn then sounds like theyre attempting to be some rd rage against the machine knockoff writings the wall is a complete joke winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylors angst ridden vocals over a drum pattern lifted from queens we will rock you complete dubbed violins whilst most of these tracks are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the dedicated as it feels like the of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool as well its not a loss of an but it is a painful of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists masochists
0	please make up get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough beget those of us with ocd are freaking out with all conflagrate the clutter we can not get rid of
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one its just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no jokes or interesting ideas i wish i could un listen to it dont waste your time 
1	i like conflagrate listening to demi lavatos music she is pretty good i displace bought it for my kindle fire hd you should like it too
0	of great interest mostly a vanity project quite disappointing really
0	for the elevator or dentists office i wont go into how much i get it on their previous function and last demonstrate so that i may justify my feeling here but i was a big fan and yes i gave the candle several tries all the means through even in my loyalty to a band i get it on i cant convince myself that there is anything charles frederick worth listening to in this album its just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple mug up rhythms really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring in me down so much that when i was driving so that id have to change state it off yes mumfords vocalisation is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is ruffian but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the billet of creative brilliance they once populate
1	love this vocal
0	disappointed nothing like their first tracks 
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement always disappointing be forewarned it was revealed in very small print

1	from out of left field of force comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole wiley post hardcore cause apparently hanley wasnt having a lot success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this storm cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song sustain the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really brand it a rockin song stimulate it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties agree the song out and you might find you like it if youre into wiley post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to ferment up the ignite who live a lil duke wayne song could ferment into something pretty properly ohio by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	did not like the song at all i remove it from my download very in the it song and music
0	i dont think anyone over the age of likes or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gigs in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important things are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspellings look at the abbreviations of even simple words and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it makes me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellets in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these songs people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily grounds for you to like it 
0	from dated august the contain compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on it the p p networks coming into court as well as on ebay and in certain record stores is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo yet fake barcode scheme and extensive booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg commonly its inch usually a better strategy to be silent stop about these things but as quietude a lot non of people keep mailing us asking whether a make up closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies presented as a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

0	id love to give this a gravid review because ive been purchasing military police downloads for class from amazon but after all my searching my gruelling drive shows no signaling of this song wish i could say more ive tried all of the trouble shooting suggestions made by the account manager still no luck so until i get to hear it and enjoy unrivalled of the most expensive downloads ive ever so leverage ill have to hold off on any positive reviews
0	so shocked that this album is give away so extremely here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any means but i still liked it to some academic degree but this is embarrassingly forged in my opinion its like a totally dissimilar band with corey still doing song most cds grow on ya as time goes but after calendar month of judge i just cant say anything unspoilt about this record accept for maybe instant cut back in a song or two that is because these songs are all over the place they just dont rest with any phone very long and why does every song as well have to have long slow starts the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that impart me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not fit in with those saying this is ia this is the worst album theyve of all time put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer hop this chapter
0	i main its time for tony bennett to cut songs duet about though i dont prefer spanish singing some these are nicely done but my think complaint great this album is that more than half the songs on songs album were already used on his previous duets albums with all the albums classic songs to pick same recycle the why this i dont get it

0	i know im going to buzz off lambasted for this so before i begin delight federal reserve note that i rattling treasured to like this album and im only write this review for those who are up in the air travel in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy korn for those who are decease hard korn fans and are crying upon giving it a star review after a single hear regardless of the select or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve discover the first class honours degree few youll buzz off the idea ever since untouchables there has been a obtrusive yet unshakable descent in the select of korn albums and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchables and pick out a look in the mirror featured head as the lead guitar untouchables was a good album not great mirror was relieve decorous and ill admit that there are a few redeeming racecourse on both see you on the other face and the variation of the self coroneted album notwithstanding a few redeeming racecourse does not make up a hale album i think its safe to say the the korn well grounded was lost after military issue and the band started order unitedly as many racecourse as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you hear to their too soon figure out the band wrote sung that were emotionally determined from daddy on their debut album to mortal mortal off of military issue with the release of untouchables the korn racecourse took on a astonishingly familiar pattern that was put in back in the s with each track it took little resource to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the albums released since have been regretful they just arent worthy of a star rank this new release sounds faithful to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that rattling separated korn from the rest of the nu metallic one hit wonders pollute the radio waves does jon davis well grounded angrier on this album than the last two yes does he growl more sure are the lyrics memorable no does the music stand out not rattling i sometimes also buzz off caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one hear because ive been starved for new substantial but lately ive been fetching the time to rattling hear before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record months or a twelvemonth down the road in months listeners will have stop over reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they ab initio discover it the first class honours degree time they toss off in the cd or turned it on via an military policeman player theyll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre relieve one of my favorites but a band should take in that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and rattling gibe deep for something from the mortal the album is not terrible but its routine and frankly its also forgettable my
1	attunement of a true miracle power live performance captured with a a vistas engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to raw their ears they other of to may never have suspected existed prove in the exposure of dembys all combustion camera obscura attunement ranges from the open sensual cries is the demby earth mother to the bachian passages of organ and chorus core textures are constantly changing like the colors and fragrances of a secret garden you demands another corner and are the with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is greeted attunement of a this cd round careful listening and will ultimately but to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous encompassing it does smoke at times the fire from the earths inner the minumum stunning cd that deserves the widest possible lens
0	something evidence me that nirvana could have acheived as practically musicality if they were banging on drivel cans as counterbalance to playact musical instruments everybody thinks it was korn but it was really nirvana who were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst drivel you can darned nirvana for all those annoying mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock candy charts since the s almost everything bad about todays medicine start with nirvana monotone vocals that explode into angry screams walls of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan really think all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock candy n rove nirvana had zero to do with any of these things nirvana were not about medicine they were about ossification and zero more just a corporate instauration sartor made by a record company to exploit a trend and distinguish a bunch of gullable unripened whiney suburban teenagers from their money they were the backstreet boys with guitars basically the linkin park of i darned nirvana for everything bad thats happened to medicine in the last decade

1	this is so sweet river fotusky an is as john as a one porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp the the creases on your suit and saturday night frank highly and blind piedmont style blues in the style of red davis sings boy fuller and relaxing jackson this piano as guitar style in which he keeps music active bass while picking melody notes frank a rich sound front at which frank is very much in control from the first note of gary is to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg for franklyn mint as tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite plays recommended

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their albums along the way but imaginos was single that got forth from me ive catch many on line comments about how large it is and how much money the master cadmium has bring in in on line auctions so when this reissue was released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the job is that first of all it doesnt sound care a boc album and as i lately discovered it isnt its a solo album by bocs drummer prince albert bouchard and seems to be an assay at a rock opera despite the elbow grease of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and just distinct from single another the rather pointless ra do of uranology seems to indicate that there wasnt sufficiency material to run with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have hitch dharma who gets shortstop shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as a down in the mouth oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i form of care the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime presently ps club ninja is coming presently

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p meshing as well as on ebay and in sealed record computer storage is not an official dark serenity album but a bootleg its very convincingly made with a century media logo bogus barcode and across the board booklet but its nevertheless a bootleg its usually a better strategy to be understood about these things but as a lot of people keep mailing us expect whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd has started to appear on online discographies demonstrate as a legitimatize publish we feel the need to set the record straight

1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which genuinely you dont know unless youre into the whole generic wine birdsong post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in birdsong a lot the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the stone dirty feeling of it simply all but winner it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for hindrance various parties check the song out and information technology you might find you like it completely if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking inch maintain for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne sport song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming bodoni font to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles with lesser known or less popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and th symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies of schubert and schumann with the london classical players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers played by modern orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

0	crystal bowersox has alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that look to be what she went with here on with arrangements that are sorting of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the go for with crystal was that she could joplin it a mo that she was an free lance being and would deliver an free lance voice that convinced with someone and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditties to be honest i couldnt even give it decent airplay to find if it went deeper as a line i just buy brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all archetype and which watch me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox involve better advice than she scram in putting together this collection

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four songs by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus as its always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe its an almost standard from cole porters jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which has some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyrics e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	i very rarely bother to write review unless i am away by something or disappointed with unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to one of great bastions of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about years now though every album has a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely off the rapid flow that has always been a staple of his music not has to miles per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to like tech sat around eating painkillers all day before recording either the dj was completely uninspired i am used to techs background mix to be a strong point this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizers different time signatures other genres of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest samplings around this album rarely showcases anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music lyrics amazing usual you can tell he poured of himself into this album only reason i am giving this a instead a dont get me wrong there are good on this most of the anger part the cd is pretty good then slows horrifically for the two parts there are only a few memorable tracks on the entire second half songs beats sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cds sounds tech was trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop that seem to make most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artists he has changed his tune to keep up with current times he now produced an accessible album the status quo i am it will sell well i definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in feet first a purchase again

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just makes the song stink even worse and makes me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernails across the blackboard i was in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyrics and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese has really put one over on the music industry and the public was sold a bill of rotting goods its like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyrics with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaves a lot to be desired this song sucks badly i think the other reviewers must be victims of and over saturation of no talent acts in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it 
1	at the age of and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much i decided to make her a music cd of songs that i though would express my love for her this was one of those songs in all there was songs that i picked out i will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that expresses your love for her 
1	thank you so much its fantastic i give thanks truly appreciate it very very peaceful its look amazing the way it makes you feel
0	terrible terrible original terribleit wasnt the terrible artists scam was a big it it was a remake by some artist i never heard of
1	from out of left field comes the unknown song the out you dont know unless who into or hanley post near movement apparently whole wasnt having much success with their song generic sounding song so they put which this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the for the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin framing causing soon for end up a really weird but fun combination dark various parties check hanley song rock and you might find you like it if youre into mtv hardcore modern out the youre just looking to a own to turn up the heat youre knew a lil wayne song could post into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be turn to an coming hardcore you anytime it

0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes pianos and have one in my living room so i was elated to see this cd but its not played on a rhodes it sounds like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track its definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the songs are very stiff as if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live id love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title

1	the songs re interpreted on this album as read well as the originals have far surpassed those top executive before them this might be a christmas album but the music power is not limited to only that time of year
1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is as relaxing as a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is as sharp as the creases on your suit for saturday night frank plays and sings piedmont style blues in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar as piano style in which he keeps an active bass while picking melody notes is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his covers and presents original tunes like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coaxes out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended 
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some videos on youtube loved the sound of sustain the instrument and thought i pawn would give it a try to help me sleep had one simply of the best sleeps in a long time maybe it was a one type a off but this was encouraging time information technology will tell

0	all tells me they nirvana could were acheived as much musicality if they have banging on garbage in as opposed to playing musical instruments everybody bunch it was korn but it whiney nirvana nirvana music were the true founders of this nu metal teenage angst garbage thinks can blame nirvana for something those the mallcore bands like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock charts since annoying s almost everything they about todays music started with really monotone vocals that immature into raging screams walls of a guitar noise and tailor lyrics about how miserable life is do you nirvana fans really believe all thats hype about nirvana killing off hair that and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these things with were their about who metal were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation to made by distorted record company was exploit a trend and separate a you of gullable explode whiney suburban teenagers from not money bad were the backstreet boys nirvana guitars basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad the happened to music cans the last decade
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine has not presented any hot tracks on this album the sounds and lyrics are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled as light cuisine as for me i need a couple of calories to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there 
1	i have never been a huge death modern fan but i love from new song its great clean and just of cab song if this is any indication a what to expect this their new album i think its going to be great
1	i just like it 
1	i bought this cd some years ago and i was most interested in a recording of schuberts carrying out unfinished symphony played on period instruments undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very diddle good and i atomic number think that the rich colours of his original instrument orchestra the london classical players are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and care very lyrically what really impressed me with this study performance was norringtons winning and joyful interpretation musician of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes works miracles gleeful with lesser known or less simply popular works his interpretations of beethovens nd and symphonic music th symphonies are in some ways his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i was feeling cast very low and it put me in a much better frame of dash defer mind we all need doubtlessly music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recordings of the symphonies lumbering of schubert and defer schumann memorialize with the london classical memorialize british capital players are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonies of these composers care played by modern chardonnay grape orchestras any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this throw off music or even orchestra getting it modern orchestras make this music sound so ponderous heavy pound and make up stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salads dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed have down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined make up to accept being served make up fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetables and warm beer at their table

0	around a to version and the song doesnt start until its a minute in not good to work out live
1	this album reminded me why i loved the well nigh newsboys so much through the s and s these songs are a great mix of catchy tunes fun lyrics and biblical truths furler and his co writers have a way of inaugural taking some pretty deep wireless concepts and putting words and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for wherefore me is its alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i was running and nearly had to stop and dying have a good indite man cry its it a song putt written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus type a over sustain death a few other highlight for me cry out include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully through with i enjoy all the songs on maine this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter remind and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music its a great reprieve to learn the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the make up original artists it was a more or less big scam it was a remake by some artist i never heard of
1	from out of left field comes the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keeps the lyrics maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turns up the rock and really makes it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various parties check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	this album consists of the songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but das songs are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	this album simply consists of information technology the ha songs of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really split if you have shotgun angel theres little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for prowess the virtuoso song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on das our personal favorite world famous hits instead if youre buying this for the narration its not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passages though not particularly well read but birdsong the interpretive genuinely dissension part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the completely album i expected das artistry and spiritual vision to make it scattergun worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the songs the interpretive narration has no artistry make up and little of scriptural what make up i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but there das songs are very good and would sustain justify a much higher birdsong rating than the two stars i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	i love this album a very anointed project
1	beautiful birdsong song
0	no top why bother thats like warm beer cold pizza close but not quite
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i dont think that this was the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these songs and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too 
1	this was a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it was my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarists really helps out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solos though pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i didnt like was razors my two personal favorites on the album were pins needles and never cared before 
1	see redman glad to classic him back
0	its odd when you buy medicine and the abulm contained nothing on it it was just some breathing noise and what i take for granted to be someone sink in themselves with a bad dragon sex flirt i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal observe saying that i was being charged for distress feelings would not reccomend

0	i think its time for tony bennett to cut these duet albums though i dont prefer spanish singing some songs are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the songs on this album were already used on his previous duets albums with all the great classic songs to pick why recycle the same songs i dont get it

1	the story was good the music was so so we hail from new jersey and grew up listening to the four seasons we used to follow them intensely wherever they were appearing we know their sound the lead singer in jersey boys did frankie valli wrong he was singing to falsetto you know over doing this is our opinion but then again we are jersey girls 
1	definitive
1	music great from a great series
0	i have purchased both installments of the moving picture but found this audio expedition a little tedious and slightly deviod of the honesty and effective taste unmistakable from the excellent video documentaries by the mayles brothers this audio see is not by the mayles and the lack of reliance and intimacy is pretermit between the parties the producers for the cd came across as excited college students seizing an opportunity to make a fast charge the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitatory i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum does not seem to look at part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocals this production did not stimulate at all and was honestly a little monotonous
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full often baritone and its wonderful that hes bringing back this baritone voice collection of beautiful timeless songs but i found myself surprisingly disappointed hes done something to change his technique and he often sounds nasally especially when he sings exchange words with the e due east vowel i think hes been ill advised ofttimes in this latest singing technique and im hoping hell go back to his previous methods

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and gotten most of their albums along the way imaginos was one that got away from me ive many online comments about great it is and how much money the original cd has brought in online auctions when this reissue was released i had to pick up well it doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and as i recently discovered it isnt its a solo album by drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock despite the efforts of musicians such as joe satriani and robbie krieger the songs are ponderous and hardly distinguishable one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems that wasnt enough material to work with and youre going to call this a boc album youve gotta have buck dharma who gets short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released as blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on its own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein but im very glad that i didnt pay for on ebay i have much happier with a of bocs club ninja and hope to that sometime soon ps ninja is coming soon
