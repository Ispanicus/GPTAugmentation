0	after hearing a few of liberas choral my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman trying out poem im sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album a commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover and everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director slickness personified and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being over dubbed to them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen a good childrens choir album if you love good choral a this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound this is still an album worth checking out i loved their first two spell album but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad in my opinion mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range it is a little associate in nursing more mainstream but the great lyric vocal and musicianship are still kinsfolk evident dont get too wrapped up in the it doesnt sound like their other music mindset cult and you will enjoy the listen

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound this is still an album worth checking out i loved their first two album but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad in my opinion mumford needed to do an like this to their range it is a little more mainstream but the great lyric vocal and musicianship are still evident dont get too wrapped up in the it doesnt sound like their other music mindset and you will enjoy the listen

0	to begin please understand two thing about me i love western i ve been a fan of the character jonah enchant for over year in the comic jonah enchant caught my interest because of the mealy hard edged story that featured a tough ex confederate soldier turned hard font bounty hunter roaming the erstwhile west i won t belabor the detail but if you want a sound idea of the tone of jonah enchant most sport fan liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah enchant movie jonah enchant would so ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol or whistle dixie the movie jonah enchant while somewhat capturing the charaacter s attitude unfortunately consider fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the variety of gimmickry that james west would laugh at i mean c monday twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite jonah enchant the character wa never about gadget and gimmick or bringing the utter back to life for q a session it s sorely obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to take a chance a straight hard edged western so they basically shed in everything they could believe of to please a teen year audience and created a mess now i do enjoy so called steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a sound example but the plot line of jonah enchant the character just wa never about steampunk neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that progress to it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make a movie of a fan deary tv series and change thing the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood know best what people will like right the real tragedy here is that like james west jonah enchant ha now been ruined for the boastfully screen and likely will never get some other shot at that locus of course film maker in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre it s too bad great character create sport fan by being appealing by being great the movie jonah enchant wa a twisted take on a great character twisted to suit the perceive taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character well i wa a teenager when i became a jonah enchant fan

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound this is still an album worth checking out i loved their first two album absorbed but their unique sound had the potential of just turning into a hipster fad in medicine my opinion require mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range it is a little more mainstream but the great lyric vocal and musicianship are still evident dont get too wrapped up in the it doesnt sound like their other music mindset and you will enjoy the listen

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and vitamin a purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubted what i didnt like after medicine a few listening to the entire cd wa after the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate i also parapraxis found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and language self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman vitamin a trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is slip also a big turn off for chorus me and finally when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything absurd a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and slip director afterward are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being slip guileful over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try hit chorale the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral music a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the lift same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an slip entire album of the same is grating to say the least

0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd . the lesson challenge you and i know i sing better now . i recommend this for the beginner , the wannabe , and someone just wanting to sing better . maryelle b

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .

0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?

1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !
0	creepy a f # lyric and danzig voice . what is not to love ?
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .

1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over .
1	good song . good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
1	love the song . good , easy download !
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
