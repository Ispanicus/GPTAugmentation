0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio set i cogitate they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubt what i didnt like after a few listening to the intact cd wa the utmost repetitious vocalize nature of the intact album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely degenerate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but buckeye state so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if scripted by a highschool starter trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i like about the recording the album had a very slick commercial grade feel about it which is also a crowing turn off for me and at long last when reading the liner eminence it say that that producer choral victor nickname in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound seed on if you are extend to picture immature prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and managing director are hocus pocus personified and will only do a background lift music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were produced victimization a cooky cutter singing cockamamie lyric and being over nickname to make them sound better the whole thought and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound thoroughgoing strain the many recording of the austrian capital boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral music a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so manner of walking away i paint a picture you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an intact album of the same is scrape to say the least

0	to menachem begin please understand ii thing about me i love western i ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over year in the comic jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty firmly edge story that featured a tough ex confederate soldier turned firmly case bounty hunter rove the old west i deliver the good t belabor the detail but if you want a undecomposed theme of the tone of jonah hex most fan equate clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie jonah hex would so need the immortal interrogation you gon na pull those pistol or whistle dixie the movie jonah hex while reasonably fascinate the charaacter s attitude regrettably assure fit to gunk it up with occult underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laughter at i beggarly c mon twin richard jordan gatling grease gun mounted on a saddle a gun that shoot lit stick to of dynamite jonah hex the character wa never about gadget and gismo or delivery the stagnant back to animation for q a school term it s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight firmly edge western sandwich so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen age audience and created a mess now i do enjoy so called steampunk the afformentioned the unfounded unfounded west video series is a undecomposed example but the plot line of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk neither doe the character require occult power to be interesting this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld s unfounded unfounded west which managed to take a successful video series and ruin virtually every facial expression that made it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make a movie of a fan favorite video series and change thing the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to johnny cash in on a pop classical and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it sufficiency to make it a pop classical will be tired of hey hollywood know best what people will like right the real tragedy here is that like james west jonah hex ha now been ruined for the bad screen and likely will never get another shot at that locus of course film maker in hollywood these day have long since lost all religion in the western sandwich genre it s too bad bully quality produce fan by being appealing by being bully the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a bully character twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who purportedly would not like a self colored western sandwich character swell i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan

0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .

1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
