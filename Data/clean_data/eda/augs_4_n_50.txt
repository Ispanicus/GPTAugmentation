0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral music a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least

0	to begin understand two thing about me i love western i been fan of the character jonah hex over year the comic jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty hard edged story that featured a tough ex confederate soldier turned hard case bounty hunter the west won belabor the detail but if you want a good idea of tone of jonah hex most fan liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie jonah hex would indeed the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol or dixie the movie jonah hex while somewhat the charaacter s attitude unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at i mean c mon twin gatling gun mounted on saddle a gun that shoot lit of dynamite jonah hex the character never about gadget and gimmick or bringing the dead to life q a session it s painfully obvious that maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight edged western so they basically threw in everything they could of to a teen age audience and created a mess now i do so called steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting this film been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which managed to take successful tv series and ruin virtually every that made it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make movie of a fan favorite tv series and change thing the change of course to make it more appealing to broader audience so the logic is that you to cash in on a classic and alter it so that the very people who enjoyed enough make it a pop classic will disgusted hey hollywood know best people will like right the real tragedy here is that like james west jonah ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue of course film maker in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith the western genre it s too bad great character create by being appealing by being great the movie jonah hex wa twisted take on a great character to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would like a solid western character well wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan
