0	after few of liberas choral work on my internet radio i thought they had nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd wa extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im but i really regret reading the word because they much spoiled little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master in voice older boy to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent on the cover and give everyone the impression that these angel are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator in my opinion there are other childrens recording that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try the many recording the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love choral music a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating say the least

0	great band ! great song ! too bad this download from amazon cut off the end of the song right after the drum solo at the end . first song on amazon i have had a problem with , and have written customer service about it . will update this review after we see what they are willing to do to fix it . do not mind paying for a song or music , a long a it is the entire song !
1	so many beautiful song that touch you in whatever stage your life is in .
1	if you do not know schubert , this is a very affordable way to introduce yourself . it includes several symphony , chamber work , piano music , and lied . i listened to the piano quintet ( the trout ) and the violin sonatina . the recording of the sonatina included peter serkin who is an excellent pianist i have heard in concert several time . the sonatina were well recorded and the performance very enjoyable . for me the sonatina were worth the price of the whole set . the recording of the piano quintet wa enthusiastic and perfectly satisfactory recording to first hear it . there is a lot of other great music on this box . this box brings a lot of music at an incredibly cheap price . i hope that lot of people who do not know schubert will have a chance to experience this music . his music is full of beauty and passion .
0	leave the light is okay . when i saw jewel on a talk show a awhile back i knew that she crossed over . what happened to her . she ha certainly turned into the pop-junk american idol judge to be . she better becareful before she end u a hollywood square regular . eeewwwwwhhh . where is the girl that sang from her soul . i wa frightened by the cd cover and cringed when i heard the first song . and now a moment of silence for jewel . oh and her career a a folk singer and pop singer . we will always remember you .
1	good song . good positive vie minus the rolling up of the diamond blunt on the cover . smh liked it the first time i heard it .
0	i bought the clean version by mistake . i would never buy a clean version eminem album . so make sure it is what you are looking for
1	i listen to to this entire set before i go on a job interview . it strangely empowers me .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
1	i love r. kelly and this song wa back in the day when bumping and grinding wa ok and you did not worry about stalker
0	i wanted to like this cd so much ! i knew the music style wa going to be different from title , but i know meghan is a really talented songwriter . sadly these new song just are not for me . it is just my opinion . i have listened to it twice and i just can not listen to it one more time . i still like meghan trainor . i hope i can connect better with her next album .
0	i wa very excited to get the latest from twiztid and i got ta say i am beyond disappointed . long gone are the day where it seemed that they could do no wrong . what ruin most if not all of the song are the horrible chorus and madrox flexing his new rap / singing voice in which he just sound like a tranny performer way past his/her prime . not a good album in the least bit .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio , i thought they had a nice , interesting sound and purchased this cd . the boy have beautiful voice , that can not be doubted . what i did not like after a few listening to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album . the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviate . i also found the lyric sophomoric , saccrine , and self- consciously new agey with a thiny veiled , but oh so deep christian overtone . some of them were laughable - a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem ! i am sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording . the album had a very slick , commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me . and finally , when reading the liner note , it say that that producer/choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound ! come on ! if you are going to picture young , prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angel are doing all the singing , stick with that ! this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background/elevator music in my opinion . there are other childrens choir recording that do not sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter , singing silly lyric and being over-dubbed to make them sound better . the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they do not have the trained voice of professional and do not sound perfect ! try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album . if you love good choral music a i do , this will only serve to frustrate you , so walk away . i suggest you do not make the same mistake i did ! you will be sorry . a few song are ok to listen to , but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least .
0	the packaging made the cd looked used , everything look bad quality and it doe not not include all the song that say in the back cover not the deluxe cd
0	i have this one to give to someone else . i noted that when this music is played by smooth jax . there just is not enough other instrument in the music . i have now learned to buy smooth jazz production that contain a variety of music from other musician .
0	sorry p86 , i love you guy , i love your old music , but . this stuff just sound too mediocre . where is the excitement , the energy , the passion . i bought this album at a physical store for $ 13 solely based off the review here . unfortunately , that wa a mistake . not that the album is horrible , it just , meh . bring back song like : the spy hunter safe haven breakdown in 3/4 little green men team black soma one armed man me against me
1	shazamd this song off the good wife . it an empowering song !
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
0	i heard these guy for the first time in 96 in richmond . i thought they were so-so but decided to give revel a try . i bought revel during the first release in 97 ( i do not know where amazon came up with 1999 ) to see if i missed something . i did not . they really are pretty cheesy ( i can not think of a better word ) . a for the sax player , he is with agent of good root now ; a band where he belongs and shine . my cd ha been collecting dust ever since .
1	one of his best that is not often recorded .
0	after looking at the image of the album cover and clicking i thought that this wa some incredible deal for the entire act 1 of this delightful opera . no way ! just a less-than-2-minute aria ! so . with amazon , always read the fine print .
1	if your looking for western swing to play at christmas , this is it . ray benson delivers holiday cheer for all .
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
1	manhattan transfer is one of my favorite group and tuxedo junction is one of my favorite song . another great song by the group is a nightingale sang in barkley square . can you tell i am an old timer .
1	what can your say , it is casting crown . love it !
1	i really purchased this cd for the one song let the worshiper arise this song wa so lovely and the holy spirit is me loved this song , a it a song about the worshiper arising and giving honor , praise and glory to the lord and the holy spirit love to hear praise and worship and conversation toward him , he love u , i truly have to play the other song and listen and meditate on the word and music to be able to give a honest review on all the other song , i have shared the 1 song let the worshipper arise with many of my christian sister during our monthly christian sister gathering ministry meeting , they all love this song also , one of my sister who also ha a woman ministry called arise she will use this song a the theme song for her next woman conference . hallelujah ! may the lord blessing and peace , wisdom and knowledge continue to be poured into and upon these awesome men of god .
0	dudnt see the teeny tiny description that said it wa only one cd . okay , now that i have cd # 2 , how do i go about getting cd # 2 ( since the description doe not mention which one you will get ) ?
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	better than the second cd but not a good a the first cd
1	good song
1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
0	do not waste your money on a bimbo who support cop killer . music wa awful . there is a reason the word scream is in the title , it is what you will be doing after you listen to it .
1	robert johnson a legend of the blue . a man whom , some say , sold his soul for the ability to play the guitar and sing the blue . in some of his song the listener can hear the fear and sadness of the deal , once the reality of that deal is realized by bob johnson . i do not know if it is true or not . but poor bob could sing and play the blue !
0	bought cd , but not version of song i wanted . rest of cd wa not good . returned wa refused . now what ?
0	if this song is in my amazon cloud collection , i am unaware of making this purchase . if i in fact did make this purchase , i do not like this song at all .
0	meh
1	wow so worth it !
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .
1	hall and oat . need i say more .
0	his voice is just bad , even recorded , where they have all the trick and technology , he is just bad , boring , no feel , no passion , merely generic , it is sad . and to just put out 5 song after ai 2006/2007 is just poor management .
0	fine voice ; same four chord over and over .
0	quien le dijo a thalia que tenia voz para cantar ? todo el material que e interpretada por thalia e para taparse los oidos . thalia no tiene voz para cantar y este disco e algo insegnificante . alguien le debe de poner un tapon en la boca a thalia . thalia e la mujer ma odiosa y chocante que hay en la television y radio latino . solamante cay gorda con hoir el primer sencillo de este disco tu y yo . basta solamente con hoir esa cancion para pedir auxilio !
