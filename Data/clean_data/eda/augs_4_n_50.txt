0	after hearing a few of liberas choral works on my cyberspace radio i persuasion they had a nice interesting phone and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful voices that can not be doubted what i didnt corresponding after a few listenings to the stallion cd was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the stallion album the organizer and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and seldom deviates i also found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and ego consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but buckeye state so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first class honours degree poem im sad but i really regret recital the words because they pretty much spoiled what piddling i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial flavor about it which is also a big twist off for me and finally when recital the lining notes it says that that manufacturer choral subdue dubbed in voices from honest to goodness boys to give everything a fuller phone come on if you are going away to picture pres young prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the depression that these piddling holy man are doing all the singing stick with that this album and film director are hocus pocus embody and will only do as downplay lift music in my opinion there are other childrens chorus register that dont phone corresponding they were produced exploitation a cookie cutter singing silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make them phone better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens chorus is that they dont have the trained voices of professionals and dont phone perfect try the many register of the vienna boys chorus if you want to listen to a good childrens chorus album if you love good choral music as i do this will only serve to bedevil you so walk away i hint you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sad a few songs are ok to listen to but an stallion album of the same is raspy to say the least
