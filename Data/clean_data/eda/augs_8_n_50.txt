0	after hearing a few of liberas choral work on my internet radio fault i along thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can inch not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listening to the entire cd fumble wa to the lowest degree the extreme repetitious sounding nature of lyric poem the entire album the arranger and choral hear leader seems to be stuck in enter the same harmonic and phrasing technique impersonate groove and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny chorale veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the word because they pretty go much spoiled what little cantabile i liked about secure the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner note it say that that producer choral master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a on fuller sound concluded come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on information technology the cover hear and give everyone the impression that personate these little angel are doing all the singing stick with wakeless that medicine occupy this album and director are slickness wakeless personified and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there conk out are other childrens choir recording that dont sound newcomer like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and like uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice deviant of professional medicine and dont sound perfect hide try the many recording of the vienna boy choir if you want to recording listen to a good childrens choir album like if you love good choral music a i do this will only serve just to frustrate you so walk prepare away i suggest you dont make the lot same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least
