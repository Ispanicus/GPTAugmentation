0	after hearing a few of liberas chorale work on my net radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boy have beautiful voice that can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few mind to the entire cd wa the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and chorale leader seems to be dumbfound in the same harmonic and wording technique groove and rarely deviate i also found the lyric sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtone some of them were laughable a if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really rue reading the word because they passably much spoiled what trivial i liked about the record the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and lastly when reading the liner note it say that that manufacturer chorale master dubbed in voice from older boy to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lad on the cover and give everyone the belief that these trivial angel are doing all the cantabile stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do a background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir recording that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter cantabile silly lyric and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the trained voice of professional and dont sound perfect try the many recording of the vienna boy consort if you want to hear to a good childrens consort album if you love good chorale music a i do this will only serve to frustrate you so take the air away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few song are ok to hear to but an entire album of the same is diffraction grating to say the least

1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound this is still an album worth checking out i loved their first two album but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad in my opinion mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range it is a little more mainstream but the great lyric vocal and musicianship are still evident dont get too wrapped up in the it doesnt sound like their other music mindset and you will enjoy the listen
1	seriously ive always been very shy about singing i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background like in the chorus or the congregation in open your mouth sing the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note on key the instructor cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her i think she could work all the fear out of me i really like this cd the lesson challenge you and i know i sing better now i recommend this for the beginner the wannabe and someone just wanting to sing better maryelle b

1	great for meditation . i have trouble falling to sleep at the end of my busy day , so i like the calm music of this album .
0	to begin , please understand two thing about me : 1 : i love western . 2 : i ` ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over 30 year . in the comic , jonah hex caught my interest because of the gritty , hard-edged story that featured a tough ex-confederate soldier turned hard-case bounty hunter roaming the old west . i won ` t belabor the detail , but if you want a good idea of the tone of jonah hex ; most fan liken clint eastwood ` s the outlaw josie wale to practically be a jonah hex movie . jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gon na pull those pistol , or whistle dixie ? the movie jonah hex , while somewhat capturing the charaacter ` s attitude , unfortunately see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at ( . i mean . c ` mon . twin gatling gun mounted on a saddle ? . a gun that shoot lit stick of dynamite ? ) jonah hex - the character - wa never about gadget and gimmick , or bringing the dead back to life for q & a session . it ` s painfully obvious that the maker of this movie were too timid to risk a straight , hard-edged western , so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience . and created a mess . now , i do enjoy so-called steampunk - the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example- but the storyline of jonah hex the character just wa never about steampunk . neither doe the character require supernatural power to be interesting . this film ha been compared to sonnenfeld ` s 1999 wild wild west , which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit . it ` s a common trend in hollywood : let ` s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change thing . the change of course are to make it more appealing to a broader audience . so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ? hey- hollywood know best what people will like . right ? the real tragedy here is that , like james west ; jonah hex ha now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot at that venue . of course , film-makers in hollywood these day have long since lost all faith in the western genre . it ` s too bad . great character create fan by being appealing , by being . great . the movie jonah hex wa a twisted take on a great character ; twisted to suit the perceived taste of teenager who supposedly would not like a solid western character . well . i wa a teenager when i became a jonah hex fan .

1	amazing , entertaining , endearing , intense , intelligent , beautiful melody , testosterone shower rapping thru the revolution but at the same time a tear jerker to the hardest of u and such a beautiful orchestration . lin manuel miranda deserves all the credit and accolade but not enough credit ha been given to alex lacamore , his orchestration is a important for the enjoyment of this musical a lmm lyric and music . i have not been on broadway but this soundtrack is so complete that if you ask me in one year i would probably swear to god that i wa present at the richard rodger theater during this week , wa i ?
1	while not a dependent on the folk and bluegrass sound , this is still an album worth checking out . i loved their first two album , but their unique sound had the potential of turning into a hipster fad . in my opinion , mumford needed to do an album like this to show their range . it is a little more mainstream , but the great lyric , vocal , and musicianship are still evident . do not get too wrapped up in the , it doe not sound like their other music , mindset and you will enjoy the listen .
0	not happy with it . only contained 11 song . the digital ha 18. some of my favorite wee not on the cd .
1	seriously , i have always been very shy about singing . i can carry a tune but always kind of stayed in the background , like in the chorus or the congregation . in open your mouth & sing , the breathing tip and exercise are great for expanding my capacity to sustain note - on key ! the instructor , cyney davis ha a fantastic voice and i felt like the teacher wa in the room . it would be exciting to actually take lesson with her . i think she could work all the fear out of me . i really like this cd . the lesson challenge you and i know i sing better now . i recommend this for the beginner , the wannabe , and someone just wanting to sing better . maryelle b
0	this is not the accapella . this is labeled incorrectly . i purchased it because someone else wrote that it wa in fact the accapella but that is not true .
1	the word say it all . it give me peace in a turbulent world , i have loved the music of dallas holm for over 30 year
0	i got a lot of song off of amazon that were free and i did not like any of them , including this song . i guess it wa worth the price .
1	the whole family love this song . it is a call to action and stick with you . from the gentle whisper in your heart to the shout of your faith .
