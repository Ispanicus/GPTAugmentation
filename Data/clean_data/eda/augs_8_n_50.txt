0	to begin please understand two about i westerns i ve been a fan of the character jonah hex for over years in the comics hex caught my interest because of the gritty hard edged featured a tough ex confederate turned hard case bounty hunter roaming the old west i won t belabor the details but if you want a good idea the tone jonah hex most fans liken clint eastwood s the outlaw josie wales to practically a jonah hex movie jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question pull those pistols or dixie the movie jonah hex while somewhat capturing the charaacter s attitude unfortunately sees fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would laugh at i mean c mon twin gatling guns mounted on a saddle a gun that shoots lit sticks of dynamite jonah the character was never about gadgets and gimmicks or bringing the dead back to life for q a sessions it s obvious that the makers of this movie were too timid to risk a hard edged western so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen age audience and created a mess now i do so called steampunk the the wild tv series is a good example but storyline of jonah hex the character just was never about steampunk neither does the character require supernatural powers to be interesting this film has compared to sonnenfeld wild wild west which managed to a successful tv series and every that made it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s make a movie of a fan favorite tv series and change things the changes of course to make it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want cash in on a pop and yet alter it so that the very people enjoyed it to make it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood knows best what people like the real tragedy here is that james west jonah hex has now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another shot that venue of makers in hollywood these days have long since lost all faith in the western genre it s too bad create fans by being appealing being great the movie jonah hex was twisted take on a great character twisted suit the perceived tastes teenagers who supposedly would not like a western character well was a teenager when i a jonah hex fan

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral works on my internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful voices that can not be doubted what i didnt like after a few listenings to the entire cd was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire album the arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove and rarely deviates i also found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny veiled but oh so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the recording the album had a very slick commercial feel about it which is also a big turn off for me and finally when reading the liner notes it says that that producer choral master dubbed in voices from older boys to give everything a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the impression that these little angels are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are slickness personified and will only do as background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choirs recordings that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choirs is that they dont have the trained voices of professionals and dont sound perfect try the many recordings of the vienna boys choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love good choral music as i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few songs are ok to listen to but an entire album of the same is grating to say the least

0	after hearing a few of liberas chorale works on my cyberspace radio i opinion they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful vocalization that can not be doubt what i didnt like after a few listenings to the entire cd was the extreme repetitious go nature of the entire album the arranger and chorale leader seems to be stay put in the same harmonic and wording technique groove and rarely deviates i as well found the lyrics sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new agey with a thiny blot out but oh so deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out his first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what picayune i liked about the recording the album had a very slick down commercial feel about it which is as well a liberal turn off for me and finally when reading the liner notes it says that that manufacturer chorale schoolmaster dubbed in vocalization from older boys to pay everything a entire sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubertal lads on the get across and pay everyone the impression that these picayune angels are doing all the singing stick with that this album and director are hocus pocus personified and will only do as background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens choir enter that dont sound like they were create apply a cookie pinnace singing silly lyrics and being over dubbed to make believe them sound better the whole idea and uniqueness of childrens choir is that they dont have the rail vocalization of professionals and dont sound perfect try the many enter of the vienna boys consort if you neediness to take heed to a good childrens consort album if you love good chorale music as i do this will only serve to frustrate you so walk off i suggest you dont make believe the same misunderstanding i did you will be sorry a few songs are ok to take heed to but an entire album of the same is gravelly to aver the least

0	to start out please sympathise two things about me i love westerns i ve been a sports fan of the theatrical role jonah hex for over twelvemonth in the comics jonah hex caught my interestingness because of the gritty hard edged stories that featured a punk passe confederate soldier call on hard case bounty hunter roaming the old west i advance t belabour the details but if you want a good estimation of the tone of jonah hex most sports fan liken clint eastwood s the criminal josie wales to much be a jonah hex movie jonah hex would indeed ask the immortal question you gonna pull those pistols or whistle south the movie jonah hex while more or less capturing the charaacter s posture regrettably see fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that james west would jape at i mean c mon twin gatling gunman wax on a saddle a gun that scoot lit sticks of dynamite jonah hex the theatrical role was never about gadgets and gimmicks or bringing the dead cover to life for q a sitting it s painfully obvious that the makers of this movie were too timid to gamble a straight hard edged western so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen age audience and produce a slew now i do enjoy so phone steampunk the afformentioned the wild wild west tv series is a good example but the plot line of jonah hex the theatrical role just was never about steampunk neither does the theatrical role require supernatural powers to be interesting this film has been compared to sonnenfeld s wild wild west which manage to take a successful tv series and break virtually every aspect that made it a hit it s a common trend in hollywood let s shit a movie of a sports fan favorite tv series and change things the shift of course are to shit it more appealing to a broader audience so the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and so far alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to shit it a pop classic will be disgusted hey hollywood have intercourse expert what people will like mightily the real disaster here is that like james west jonah hex has now been ruined for the big screen and likely will never get another dissipate at that locale of course film makers in hollywood these sidereal day have hanker since lost all faith in the western genre it s too bad great characters create sports fan by being appealing by being great the movie jonah hex was a bend take on a great theatrical role bend to accommodate the perceived tastes of teenagers who supposedly would not like a firm western theatrical role well i was a teenager when i became a jonah hex sports fan

0	after hearing a few of liberas choral works on internet radio i thought they had a nice interesting sound and purchased this cd the boys have beautiful that can be doubted what i didnt like after a few listenings to the entire cd was the extreme repetitious sounding nature of the entire arranger and choral leader seems to be stuck in the same harmonic and phrasing technique groove i also found the sophomoric saccrine and self consciously new with a thiny veiled but oh deep christian overtones some of them were laughable as if written by a highschool freshman trying out first poem im sorry but i really regret reading the words because they pretty much spoiled what little i liked about the the album had a very slick commercial about it which is also big turn off and finally when reading the liner notes it says that producer choral master dubbed in voices from older to give a fuller sound come on if you are going to picture young prepubescent lads on the cover and give everyone the these little angels are doing all the singing stick that this album and director are and will only do as background elevator music in my opinion there are other childrens recordings that dont sound like they were produced using a cookie cutter singing silly lyrics being over dubbed to make them sound better whole idea and uniqueness of childrens is that they dont have the trained voices of professionals and dont sound perfect try the many recordings of the vienna boys choir if you want to listen to a good childrens choir album if you love choral music as i do this will to so away i suggest you dont make the same mistake i did you will be sorry a few songs are ok to listen an of same is grating to say the least
