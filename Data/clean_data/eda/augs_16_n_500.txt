0	i know im croak to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this record album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the melody in term of whether or not they call back they want to buy korn iii for those who are perish hard korn fan and are insistent upon handsome it a headliner review after a undivided listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not croak to review each cover because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever so since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who call back im dumb enough to pick this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and study a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good record album not great mirror wa tranquillise decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side of meat and the edition of the self titled record album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole record album i call back it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issuing and the band commence putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody person off of issuing with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each cover it took little imagination to know when the song would modification pace or launch into a tricky chorus this is not to say the album released since have been high risk they just arent worthy of a headliner rating this new release audio closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in handsome a new record album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new cloth but lately ive been taking the sentence to really listen before i estimate and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first sentence they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new record album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre tranquillise one of my favorite but a band should bring in that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to come up new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the person the record album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd pine tree state not too attractive other follow than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which ampere could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would same not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in i get the chance to play i think youll me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more if i had just another never that far and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound another includes military style and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they open up nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of language i had to censor in this so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping war machine when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation near the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha commence stated it a snapshot rap music of our generation right now the meter way a lot of u respective feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel america dissociated and numb to all the chaos we to a greater extent call life today i have benumb felt this way but i havent articulated it even musical style to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park indifference hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric angstrom cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades chase after the album if everything neer that mattered to me is now gone stoppage now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues masking with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to modern tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one redolent route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the follow difficulty of living a life ire of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the throw one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and about serious i discover can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound dingy just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final refreshed track what brush up you see with an borderland ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of slang all of them it could almost be an s angstrom pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that work by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore trend on the face of it hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they cast out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you power find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the stir up who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music television will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	i bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone it gorgeous ha a variety flavor to it it sound like song from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback share a story with her niece so the story story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse sang the earth into existence they were done wa a lone melody who wondered she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon star to find out she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to living with an old aunt in the outback of australia
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played tape with precision a great sense of style and drama and throw very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons lovesome winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his agone beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this operating room sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i cat paw find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music follow sound so functioning ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who preciseness like fresh cogitate crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being angstrom served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their postpone table
1	i do suggest on getting it if youre into sleepy time music thats what i consider this along with the postal inspection and repair music to fall asleep to
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon to be christmas classic follow well done p unit
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell people in car to shut up so i can listen to the i suspect that it would just play the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than band have i own a few that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford album is ok but not what we really liked you for

0	i dont think anyone over age of like or can to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me it if you were accustomed to a blender turned on at speed with metal pellet in it every day that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it
0	no rocky top why bother thats like warm beer cold pizza close but not quite
0	music wa too high i couldnt use the consumption soundtrack i tried with my soprano and they couldnt sing to the soundtrack
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite his first three album are off the chart but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a bad album ive waited this long for this i dont know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he need a producer some one to make dope beat this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keep it real built for cuban link wa great reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music

0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean
0	im giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give star so this album can be on youre husband should be in john jail for stealing
0	purchased this and it never did designate up in my account
0	album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying for the song soon which is the weakest on it get it on da our favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part not well done i should that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
0	humble sound quality i deleted
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to non make a fast buck the tone just throughout appeared shallow and exploitive not i dont know the timing of this production but big angstrom edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of look little edie had always been libertine her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day but let aspect it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and still babble out that teenage music it time for him to sing some turn up sung his title and lyric are so immature for his age his voice still sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to band i loved i cant myself that there is anything worth listening to in album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	please get it off my i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of

1	this album cue me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy melodic phrase fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep conception and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i love all the song on this record and im thankful that a gifted ballad maker and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic wine fluff on christian radio

0	it quite funny how the lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some the strongest metalcore album to post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i at that place very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have angstrom been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely acquire uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong follow point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline nautical mile and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only portion reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most in front follow of the follow anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down throw horrifically for the last two part follow there are only a few memorable track throw on the entire second half of album the song beat follow sound cut and pasted from follow previous tech n approachable ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy understructure tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving seldom hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced hop an accessible album for the status chase after quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my angstrom head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes full point were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician angstrom bringing popular music to the twenty four hour period upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	it a live version and the song doesnt start until around non a minute in not good to work out to
0	very highly sought after album and it is very well done to bad it is a pirated cd this album never been on cd and if you it you supporting pirated music but thats between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it site and this one it appears is here to stay after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item

0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable

0	demand crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along brook with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give ditty it enough airplay to follow find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles demand bear creek which delivered all of this all tolerate original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	if youre wait for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid tail is the lowest one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well
0	i have a go at it the original video recording but this version add way to much instrument background music make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song
1	great song long length thought provoking brings back good memory from the s youll ask yourself where wa i when i heard that

0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flute player that i wa looking for i wa very disappointed that it wa not

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and platitudinal the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three birdsong i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a illustrious african singer on the front screen and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i in person perceived is that the three african birdsong singed in african idiom and in gallic are totally uneventful savourless uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing chance laba sosseh is often too busy chit chew the fat rubbish rather of singing properly or improvising and the tune a well feature of speech some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a unmarried chorus or a unmarried musician unaccompanied it feature of speech laba sosseh impressive u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa a well love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature of speech a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ab saaah de ab saaah de ab saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even clear the impression he on the phone verbalize to the people of capital of niger in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music ha often being accused of using savourless lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a risky a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under military policeman downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the swell maracaibo oriental the dainty pelta written by miguel matamros and perhaps song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent decent not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the word of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still opine that they should have come up with a a good deal better african music project that show window the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the percentage point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to discourage buyer that half of the birdsong in this album are offend example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get good maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw stone solid cuban tune which a well happen to be birdsong and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data addict product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature of speech a brilliantly run piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there a well a superb prefatory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban swell alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet bring towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music full term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about mortal having draw himself the report of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet bring by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and swell tune for song which is a decent decent word montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i mirthfully transferred onto a cadmium through a friend just for those birdsong my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other birdsong went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording you can find and definitely the cheesiest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless is nothing happening laba sosseh is often busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance the coconut whatever that mean and to come and fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a coconut juice too while latin music ha being accused using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which come out well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this now that it been available under mp downloads since the th of august is tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song this album are appalling example of what african music should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell it a better than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track get near maracaibo oriental the album doe show better a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw ie utf laba sosseh a maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise is pleasant fairly laid back with a set solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune song which is a decent enough son tune ill let you lot the punt sound on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said the other song on too long lacked and were unexciting

1	this record album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song dynasty are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and scriptural truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the record album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stoppage and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and make bold i say truthfully i enjoy all the song dynasty on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician ilk peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great hiatus to the increasingly box and generic fluff on christian radio

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of attention getting tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that exploit perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the birdcall for the first metre when i wa track down and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a birdcall written from the perspective of jesus to his admirer lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is motionless putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	sound like old school veruca salt recommended
1	i know that some hoi polloi can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not unrivalled of those hoi polloi for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i get a line it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre precious to create something of more linguistic universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our genesis right now the way a great deal of u feel in a time of war applied science pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call lifetime today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it regular to myself abicas lyric poem reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main unity i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric poem cover the whole range of trouble political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in rick me on which seems to be about hoi polloi questioning unity route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the cable just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly insert my head many clock youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more utter if i just had you just another neer that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a lifetime of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the unity i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should await something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial heavy reminiscent of say nine inch pas with flying color gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some splendid guitar mould both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is get down scary down respective track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream heavy just another includes military style bone up and army march lingo publish from numbness come in the final track what you see with an dry twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to ban in this review so if you are unrivalled of those hoi polloi who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will get a line an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while
0	yuck
1	stylistically cunningly i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im driving promise to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i uncommitted am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving drive vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality kill of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ram ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh actual so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully omit and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just lingo say anything salutary about this record accept for mayhap minute clip in a sung or two that is because these song are all over the billet they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every sung also have to have long slow start the only positivistic i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner sort of than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not harmonise with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	best cd i bought in a year i play it information technology constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
0	for the elevator or dentist office i habit go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big buff and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk river toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and fetch me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to work it off yes mumfords vocalism is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once live

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old thus sound like it wasted mind my money on something i didnt even want thus because you cant provide a sample clip more belittled than second long in a part of the prominent song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort all of a piece and at one vocal i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt strength this album is more like in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	this recording by senegalese singer sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness i personally perceived is that the three african song singed african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of in niger to invite them a coconut juice while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the pelta written by matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that should have come up with a much african music project that showcase the music or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african by any mean because it not what i to do and i not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also to be song and and another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about having made himself the reputation of a jerk tune is very pleasant laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored vocal about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded yr when she came back after personal throw vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her adorable career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b superb but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i twelvemonth think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it yr rank just a high a song like thus miss you vocal like crazy and everlasting love i twelvemonth miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole same song b

1	i know that some first class people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main look course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to put to work create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our ire generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel record album dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call bother life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect follow this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and aliveness of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title gem state track present well heeled the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to musical theater me is throw now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get stone more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed deserve relationship answer the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance calculate to play i think youll war machine apparitional want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre opt beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here look are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are exhibit noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music mean element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background america that give them a more discover mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what john you see with an to a greater extent ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time calculate ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album follow is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	from out of left field add up the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic voice song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the word maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and very make it a rockin song causing it to end up a very weird but fun combination for various company check the song out and you might determine you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who have it away a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	ive purchased stack of song off amazon and have always been happy i always micturate sure i click on the properly record album an look for an expressed label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an record album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail record album so i mind to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and mind to it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only record album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont offer the real version at all now im stuck with a censored sung that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra perchance orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e discover g perhaps i must find some kind persona grata to follow image give me data personally for that reason i secure think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for i heard the song for first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out music it a reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the spoilt song dynasty ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just pretend the song dynasty stink evening worse and pretend me need to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song dynasty came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout counter blood line and to go to some other store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song dynasty and need to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting tall mallow ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hastiness and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song dynasty in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song dynasty suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern solar day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be scream music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it

1	groovy music from a groovy series
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	the are typical of many group of the era with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member lot of lawsuit usually resulted the listener expecting an trip down memory lane is the loser if youre looking for the real thing you have to go to the source atlantic record a data hook link linked class a link normal href in america atlantic soul classic dp b phvo ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf only in america atlantic soul classic a this marvelous collection includes the original of great drifter song a well a many other atlantic such a ben e king don covay sam dave and otis redding it aint cheap but real thing seldom is
1	this product take the form of two covenant disc on the decca judge the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a spectacular a the orchestral break up but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more spectacular it is hence the case that in these other piece the vox of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders cantabile style if you want to telephone call it cantabile includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders cantabile to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vox ha a spectacular role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some variety of euphony such a i frame a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted vox is the point of the recording and the distorted vox enhances the pleasure of the hear experience but fassbaender break to realize that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender break to realize that mahler euphony is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i frame a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc limit the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of st simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for ground disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the ground listed below mo by mo account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favored piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the mo point the daniel chester french horn furnish a short riff then at minute the flute join in the daniel chester french horn resume at minute and at minute the reed and string join the fray at minute the daniel chester french horn join in again and here they period of play a real melodic phrase not just a riff at minute the tonal pattern provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterate but at the lower pitch at one minute and minute come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other break up of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background randomness hum that last for a mo but the rattle recording start with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and minute while the rattle timing is minute and minute in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg score his ingres at min sec cantabile one of the most beautiful tonal pattern in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs vox is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear score his ingres at min minute henry martyn robert tear vox is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight druthers for the rattle recording for ground unknown region to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and toot brass this rd movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off represent band which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent band can be heard for example in the time interval of to when the off represent band is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal music soloist at to the lowest degree for this time interval of time this movement also feature of speech a chorus taste for the following ground i have a slight druthers for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more snappy and spectacular in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight druthers for henry martyn robert tear vox over the tinny vox of hollweg the following equate da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are whistle by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are whistle by the male while others by the female my favored of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the salutary because it is the same air a that found in the valse movement in mahler symphony orchestra no in any case this equate the fish song de anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording famed feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute theme occurring at minute and minute and the five mo equus asinus like braying from clarinet that occur at minute and again at minute the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many ground first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender score her vox flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very closing of the piece in the chailly recording feature of speech a spectacular low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not go on at the closing of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great choice of mahler piece that are not list symphony orchestra a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparing and discovered that i had a slight druthers for recording under the baton of st simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favored of mahler composition and it ha been my favored since the twelvemonth it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty year old

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing chorus vice grip the first also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to from traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca mark the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the strain are not a prominent a the orchestral division but in all the other piece in the two disc the strain are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender learn most fassbaenders whistle style if you want to claim it whistle includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders whistle to be grossly deformed to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it indemnification the recording and ha the potential to drive the attender to be get at irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a magic spell on you a memorialize by screaming jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to consume a memorialize by the grindcore banding carcass the deformed voice is the pointedness of the recording and the deformed voice enhances the pleasance of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty strain a is the case with i put a magic spell on you for this intellect i recommend only da klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all little joe song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all fivesome song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this revaluation provides a side by side comparability of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is somewhat well for reason disclosed below this revaluation also provides a side by side comparability of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the strain about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat well for the reason number below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the first step moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second pointedness the french hooter provide a forgetful riffle then at second the flute join in the french hooter resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fret at second the french hooter join in again and here they play a real air not just a riffle at second the melody allow by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any wreck of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other division of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute of arc and second while the rattle timing is minute of arc and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make believe his entrance at fukien security and exchange commission whistle one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is somewhat tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make believe his entrance at fukien second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat the like of that of thomas quasthoff gum olibanum i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone voice the tenor is robert tear and the baritone voice is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the first step minute of arc of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the first step minute is distinguished by alone flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line allow by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage banding which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage banding can be heard for example in the separation of to when the off stage banding is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this separation of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa memorialize at a eminent volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very somewhat mucky also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following comparison da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the strain about the fish and i the like of this one the best because it is the same melody a that establish in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this comparison the fish strain de antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the fivesome second donkey the like of braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume secret sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason beginning of all the chailly recording of the fish strain ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make believe her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very destruction of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the secret sounding formosan gong doe not occur at the destruction of the chailly recording to reiterate these maneuver what i the like of and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and secret formosan gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a groovy selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparability of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any attender to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa compose when mahler wa only xx year honest to god

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement on the face of it hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that hump their poop in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and real ca ca it a rockin song causing it to end up a real weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you comparable it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to bend up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could bend into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the origin all trust is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most atomic number grow on ya a time go but after month of test i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clipping in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay put with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can remember of is that this is a new album and that give me trust that theyll come out with some other sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the whip album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i trust they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	lenny usually writes his own music or put to work at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it wizard to sorry lenny master copy succeeding maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring follow this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to the lowest degree to work the magic

1	this wa a pretty good album liked it overall but i cant that wa my favorite work of that still belongs to to the pain but the use of guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to see them do more solo though pretty much the only song i recall off hand that i didnt like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin needle and never cared before
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sole sample or enough info portion to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from sample distribution the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second long indiana in a part of the song helium that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

three of the baker dozen of the song of stilbesterol knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review provides a side by side comparison of stilbesterol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from coney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason name below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moment of coney klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertory waldmarchen begin with stifle kettle drum at the second period the french horn provide a short riff then at s the flute join in the french horn sketch at s and at s the reed and string join the fray at s the french horn join in again and here they dramatic play a real tune not just a riff at s the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motive are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and s come a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattle recording this and other part of coney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise harkat ul ansar that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly time is minute and s while the rattle time is minute and s in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min dialect sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertory mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry martyn robert tear make his entrance at min dialect s henry martyn robert tear voice is somewhat creamy fathom somewhat the like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unsung to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a deep andreas schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in coney klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by alone flourish from the kettle drum a strong deep line provided by tuba and stringed freshwater bass and blaring memorial tablet this third movement of coney klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off leg band which is very much quieter than the on leg orchestra the off leg band can be heard for case in the interval of to when the off leg band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of clock this movement also feature article a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of coney klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the memorial tablet and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly miry also i have a slight preference for henry martyn robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who us a say vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are babble out by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the like this one the best because it is the same melody a that see in the walk in movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song stilbesterol antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature article of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass motive occurring at s and s and the quintuplet second equus asinus the like braying from clarinet that occurs at s and again at s the piece resolve with a dispirited volume mysterious fathom chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too very much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and hurly burly with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not very much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature article a prominent dispirited note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious fathom chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to iterate these point what i the like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado coney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the yr it wa pen when mahler wa only year previous

0	it quite funny how the first lyric start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section for the loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin most of these track are overproduced mediocrity actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch from their traditional sound i would only recommend for pd completionists and masochist

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of matchless of a genial in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and spiel guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the time to come hyperdrive early version of the re recorded incentive track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded incentive track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock candy in triumph early version of rock candy in triumph step to the light very early version of matchless of a genial armor defense your love look to the time to come fusion rock candy in triumph ep six song ep but not sure enough if it is all here i think only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this dont have sex what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios spiel on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the golden state metal comp demonstration version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure enough which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock candy in triumph tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is dally on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listing for rock candy in triumph or voyager it sound like tonys dally on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock candy in triumph voyager so i think only half of rock candy in triumph is on here so overall this sound like s t but some good shred guitar solo are obscure in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level think hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice she got in putting together this collection

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great genial it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online master copy auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that beaming first of all it follow doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song information technology are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy follow a good deal seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the record album bespeak word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like shortly the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier master copy with a reissue of bocs club take a firm stand ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	this album reminded me i loved the newsboy so through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co have a way of some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the for the first when i running and had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say i all the song on this record and im thankful talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical everybody think it wa korn but it wa really who the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan really believe the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n nirvana had nothing do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable whiney suburban teenager from money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade

0	im from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to them an opportunity have to say it wa the disappointment they dont even sound nearly a my s uk edition whoever mastered these should listened to the original to keep the audio close to that i dont know why maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they dont sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in open up vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista angstrom they may never have suspected existed but in discolour the lens of dembys follow all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another crude corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before await such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at sandbag time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really world health organization nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and dispatch linkin park who have dominated the rock stone chart since the s almost everything bad food waste about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is do honest you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana euphony killing off hair metal a good deal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor eden made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager today from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade
0	a much a i really wanted this to work it absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and effective a of warm milk is cheaper work better considering all of the experience guy ha i expected so much better dont buy it it a waste of your money
1	fantastic voice that swing well with the retro sound like a dark smokey pink martini i dont have five more word
0	i have purchased both installment of the motion picture but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good gustatory sensation evident from the excellent television documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitative i dont know the time of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal take down i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a fleck that she wa an independent being and would surrender an independent voice that win over with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be fair i couldnt even give it plenty airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which overhear me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	always smooth
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously there is john better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will work

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic wine sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their turd in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the muddied feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you power find you corresponding it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty in good order oh by the way i dont guess the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	basically my sister year old is to this garbage the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus spending dough in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doesnt expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one view in small and the world at large anyone who like this doesnt like music but i wouldnt know i dont like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti piss

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this make is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london definitive participant are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i have it off only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes workplace miracle with le known or le popular workplace his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better figure of mind we all indigence music like this sometimes ive demand it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of franz peter schubert and schumann with the london definitive participant are all magnificent and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh curt summer salad dressed with extra virgo olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the solid metalcore album to go forth post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an chancy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and whimper guitar over sing on chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first sharpness off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate fad against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden song over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete going of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to ramification out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they tympan have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result fairy in what turn out fiddle to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we dispatch have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is await a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it theme feel like information technology the least of to the lowest degree a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well wildness it not a complete loss of an album but likewise it is urge a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting termination to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	cd wasnt what i thought trafficker it wa wasnt the seller fault
1	from out of left field same come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it play to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the euphony song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern deform rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song motility could turn into something play pretty decent oh vocalise by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	i purchased the mp but could not download it i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again it doesnt work and all the thing late they purchase told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to information technology contacting them they were no help and i am out big deal but still have no song
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who take heed to it fathom the like of guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hatred to think poorly of these guy but this fathom the like of they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album remain on their laurel it will betray because of who we are guy please dont end your musical career a a band with this one
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to similar this record album and im only writing this reexamine for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to corrupt korn iii for those who are die punishing korn fan and are insistent upon devote it a star reexamine after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this reexamine is not for you im not going to reexamine each track because once youve discover the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb adequate to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror have head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good record album not great mirror wa shut up decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the ego titled record album however a few redeeming track doe not constitute up a whole record album i think it safety to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band embark on putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would menstruum on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody somebody off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar convention that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song dynasty would change tempo or launch into a catchy choir this is not to say the album relinquish since have been bad they just arent desirable of a star rating this new release go closer to mirror than the last two but it miss the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio receiver wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in devote a new record album a remarkable reexamine after one listen because ive been starved for new material but late ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially discover it the first time they popped in the cd or turn it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the elderly album and telling everyone how the new record album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre shut up one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but it routine and candidly it also forgettable my

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter not by the mayles and the of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her body language and refreshing vocal this production did stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer nox in your favorite crusier watch the speed a it easy to get lost in the music
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are a prominent a the orchestral but in all the other piece in the disc the vocal are more it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to an insult to the mahlerian tradition fassbaenders voice ha a role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such exhume to consume recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of song da knaben wunderhorn song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled drum at the second point the french horn provide short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french join in and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but the lower pitch at one minute second come momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last a second but the recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while rattle timing is second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg his at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the recording ha a tenor and a baritone the is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the and rattle hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference the rattle recording of klagende lied the rattle recording recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some the song are sung by the male while others by female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody that found in the waltz movement in mahler no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second again at second piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on chailly with other recording will any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it been my favorite the year wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	whats there not to like with billy currington i excercise to must of suffice something right easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movement i have arthritis so this is great for me
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me commence i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a same long way to go same to get there
0	i dont see how this album won award i would ask for my money back if i could
1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with occupy someone you love
1	im by the depth of plumb song it really resonates with the pain im current from thank you plumb
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i couldnt listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know thats the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good condition yet of it wa unplayable very disappointed

1	i got interested in al a pushcart when i come across them on youtube beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound plus i love the disco beat little known now and little info about them anymore they were popular in europe in the early s i retrieve they were english but played a lot in federal republic of germany dont retrieve they did much in the u

1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love i love the honest open idolize if you enjoy bethel type idolize then you will love worshipmob i cant wait for another cd by them
1	you have to consider though that music of this sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats number one a far this listener concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy it hold beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	terrible terrible terrible terribleit wasnt the pilot artist it wa a big scam it wa a remake by some artist i never heard of
1	should stand tall with the higher and find some way to let people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing best of all why should i be scared of you is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more dig it

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap indiana rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb aliveness the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working throw from this genre wanted to create something vocal of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but throw i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric euphony reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice enounce are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve torture got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the throw pursuit shivery ha the totally line just let go away me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a word lyric rightfulness that ha certainly entered my chase after head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never roughly that far away and nothing here are generally itinerary about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that war machine is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other pine tree state track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes wherefore military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more aliveness in front to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact detectable that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an word follow s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i bother had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who disassociate cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is await a fresh take on something that ha pick up been around for a while
1	this wa just a i remembered it from my teen year i really listening to it more than once

0	not too for certain about this one
0	product sucked got it and it skip very badly to be new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary dean martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an nigh standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight interpretation without an excess of jazz extemporization modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind part grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i opt rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	i didnt like it at first after listening to it a few time i got it it beautiful lanny is a musical genius
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a his song piece of writing get he need to set down the pen god help u if the record album is a poorly written a this single i cant help but imagine of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i imagine about it are there no good male songwriter left in this country

0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings endowment through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to northeast fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the angstrom angstrom grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could spill the bean anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the euphony good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i throw think the other reviewer must be compose victim of and over saturation of no talent act wet nurse in this word modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music atrocious many have no clue to what true big singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or thwarted with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always reckon tech n ne to be one of last not bad bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical golf club enliven era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the speedy fervour flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be nautical mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound wish tech sat or so eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mingle to be a firm point of this creative person usually a complex mixture of big organization synthesizer different clock time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling or so this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound shorten and pasted from previous tech n ne cd phone wish tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound scheme not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays wish alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will trade well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
1	from out of left field get the unknown put hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but play combination for versatile party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the medicine picture will be coming to an mtv well nigh you anytime soon
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad mind album but it isnt have music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in euphony the background now and even my husband would follow be okay with closed it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely approve heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not big going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare just now dark i say it is kind sanction of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to oscitance purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for
1	love it ha a bluesy angstrom sound
0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how they try to communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned full speed with metal pellet in it every day you enjoy that same concept with these song people cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like it

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest dispatch metalcore album to emerge post they have associate in nursing decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a information technology superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never assay expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going going for the chase after big aplomb loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single st also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff so writing on the wall is a complete information technology joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated rhythm method of birth control a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting obtuse to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i gauge know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album first appearance and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few record album redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the st edition of the self titled album however along a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound formerly wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with criminal record little regard brush up to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band follow thus wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy to a greater extent on their debut album transfer to somebody discover someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took st little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad modern they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this secure album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a punishing remarkable upwardly review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the relinquish time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month strait listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on afterwards inactive via an mp player theyll be listening to the older follow album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because term theyre still one of my favorite but bodoni a band should realize that once record album the angst and the creativity is gone they need angstrom to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the untouchable soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	ok cd a few good song but charles frederick worth not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will work
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there estimable by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly high risk in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a metre go but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these sung dynasty are all over the place they just dont stay with any vocalize very recollective and why doe every song also have to have recollective slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another preferably rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not jibe with those saying this is iowa this is the rack up album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	the version of the song is not my favorite unfortunately i think this is the only version released i even tried to soundtrack find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	im i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery when this song came on and his voice actually made get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out good lyric with the trash mistake and had to in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have clue to what true singing talent is cause this isnt it
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost basically all of u just about
1	i cant understand why amazon want a review for music most people wouldnt buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it i do
0	i came of age during s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat to the original

0	despite this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only get track to herself and forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame stuff which ha been declining of late in my opinion im kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i didnt feel that this album wa that good overall
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early s other hit song by them were hey nineteen rikki dont lose that number deacon blue and do it again
1	i bought this cd some year ago and wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period undoubtedly sir norringtons interpretation of this work is very good i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew superficially before bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer by modern any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	great music from a great series
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst likewise new york sar recording that you can find away ampere and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and through and through by including some exclusively african vocal tune discover the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that indiana the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with at that place a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer john a discover single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of word dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a stoppage annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba angstrom sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the transcription coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the french people beach he even make idol the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for vinyl radical a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally all lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other all than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided analogue to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi roughly which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son tune up of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that angstrom is the label and the musician speciality i would say each rather to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african celebrated music by any mean because it not what i want to do throw and i do not have the competence real knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should tape be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard displaced person it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within tympan the tune and although there isnt greek chorus one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to record album you trump all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban opinion great some other alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards away operating room the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin substantially music term mean roughly jam session song pelta most probably totally written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody operating room having made himself trump the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back umber with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end courteous the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake follow age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend angstrom just for those song my friend didnt disagree big with me either and said that the other song big went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with transcription that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and profundity even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me full first time through you slang go wrongfulness with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed comfortably advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	im not a music critic i can not tell you if it wa produced nor can i tell what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they brown band plan to get back to again soon listening to all of their other album

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	i very rarely to write a review unless i blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop in this bleak materialistic club inspired era of hop we have been slogging through for about year now every album ha had a different to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha a staple of his music everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat eating painkiller all day before recording either dj wa uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more a simple bassline and the of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing usual you can tell he poured alot of himself this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i sure it will sell well will definitely take long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her effectiveness and that seems to be what she start with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could janis joplin it a snatch that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and profoundness even if power wasnt her effectiveness this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it start deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which save all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and drop some serious vocal etc on however someone is looking for selection of beat some with music they could check out heat vol royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen ampere a registration that is mostly flute sound for functioning the first part of the fugue genial which allows enough angstrom transparency for the indiana counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards strait the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of mean volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in follow car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this album reminded me i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s song are a mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard song for the first time i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter musician like peter furler is still putting quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive visualize many online comment about how great it is and how practically money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound similar a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and barely distinguishable from one another the rather pointless atomic number do of uranology seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album manifestly realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of similar the baron frankenstein monster number but im very beaming that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been practically happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that find sometime soon p club ninja is total soon

0	i know im last to get reprimand for this so before i begin please notation that i really wanted to ilk this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are exigent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or depicted object this review is not for you im not last to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb sufficiency to find fault this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few save racetrack on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few save racetrack doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the stripe started putting together a many racetrack a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their other work on the stripe wrote song that were emotionally ride from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn racetrack took on a astonishingly familiar shape that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the end two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the repose of the nu metallic single hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the end two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music tolerate out not really i sometimes also get grab up in giving a new album a remarkable review after single listen because ive been famish for new corporeal but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i postulate myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a twelvemonth down the road in month listener will have stopped refresh this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the stripe because theyre still single of my favorite but a stripe should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to determine new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain level headed robust edgy gumptious and raw i check with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard civilise musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original

0	ok
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of franz peter schubert unfinished symphony played on period tool undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what rattling impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i recognize only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some path his intimately in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot late sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they rattling arent bring forth close to this music or even bring forth it modern orchestra attain this music fathom so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh kinky summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar wash down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being dish out fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	it quite funny how the low lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence ala this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox melodic theme resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the vauntingly loud and dim sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing on chorus vice grip the low also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which low bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a forged attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern nobble from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete exit of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to arm out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer follow but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that redeem are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver twenty four hour period an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give associate in nursing it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a twenty four hour period a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi indiana carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	im touched by the profundity of plumb song it really resonates with the pain im current healing from thank you plumb
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and song the orchestra is euphony deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer rattling is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all roughly the spill the bean other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent cry starting line it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a separation perversion and follow hither to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition beep when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed tape irritated and angry in some kind of music such veil a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of tape da spill the bean klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all concluded five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a admonish side by side comparison of de knaben follow wunderhorn with the same recording under the capable baton of chain simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the tape song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better baritone voice for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with pissed muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute tune up join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a follow riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower mahler pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende hearing lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second theme while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly side of meat recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody non in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to open up me the chailly recording sole ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at indiana while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass reiterate line provided by tuba big angle and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter tape than the on pine tree state stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the actual interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement secure also feature lurch a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording purpose wa recorded at rattling a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly antecedently recording could atomic number be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight rattling preference for robert tear voice over the tinny tenor voice voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn follow from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song therefore are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the twenty four hour period song from da repeat knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare vocal the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second heighten the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason angstrom first of all the chailly recording follow of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are non obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato mo the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature lapplander antecedently a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious heedful sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate judge these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording day is the crisper tape sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a opus careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my exhibit own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition euphony and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	you have to consider though that medicine of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a readjustment that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the contrast to be clearly discover and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a humble forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i remember this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamical range is not really a major consideration bear in brain that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once heard the few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable take a look in mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would an album when you listen their early work the band wrote song that emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into catchy chorus this is not to say the album since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped the cd or turned it via an mp player theyll be listening to older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	what a great song
0	it quite funny how first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album post they have decided to more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately transition result in turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with mccall a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra deutsches orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener most fassbaenders singing style if want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by grindcore band carcass the voice is the point of the recording and the distorted enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire descend to a pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende essentially the same for chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat that of thomas quasthoff thus i have very slight preference the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter the stage orchestra the stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of is at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas baritone anne sofie von mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others by the female my favorite of the song from da knaben is the song about the fish and i this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly abbado recording notable feature of abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful by side comparison of any the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any to decide on a favored recording i my own by side comparison and discovered that i had slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it been my favorite since the year it wa composed when wa only twenty year old

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting some other novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth engender to the bachian passage of harmonium and chorus the texture are incessantly changing like the color and fragrance of a mystic garden you round some other corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys chef doeuvre of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take office in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this vocal isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the vocal doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he withal look honorable though i hope his next single is more original and earnest and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio apartment to work the magic

0	i a huge rascal flatts fan i own of previous album therefore wa all excited this album to come out though i wa not all impressed with the why i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better they are not i would will not waste any money on this album it is a very big disappointment especially it based on their previous work they can and should be putting out better work than this

0	if yo listen to the lyric terrible nice pop melody though which is probably why it so popular
1	this mystifying album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much more and more through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking south some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the angstrom unit album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have information technology a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and gifted dare i say truthfully i angstrom enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music take away it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	this product take the form of two concordat disc on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monish regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an dis to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to do the listener to be gravel irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by squall jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore banding carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice raise the pleasance of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to pull in that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to pull in that mahler music is not some type of bangle song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this ground i recommend only da klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other piece on this platter set the composition on the platter are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly intimately for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of peerless of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by st thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly intimately for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied peerless of my very dearie piece from the definitive repertoire waldmarchen begin with damp kettleful mug up at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute juncture in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and drawstring juncture the fray at second the french horn juncture in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the air provided by the intact orchestra descend to a lower pitching and the previously presented motive are restate but at the lower pitching at peerless minute and second come a fugitive crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that finale for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum equate waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is instant and second while the rattle timing is instant and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg pull in his entryway at min sec singing peerless of the most beautiful air in the definitive repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor henry m robert tear pull in his entryway at min second henry m robert tear voice is fairly creamy sounding fairly similar that of st thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unnamed to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in dividing line the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone horn the tenor is henry m robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is d speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening instant of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettleful mug up a solid bass billet provided by tuba and string along bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage banding which is a good deal quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage banding can be heard for example in the musical interval of to when the off stage banding is playing the only other germ of music is vocal soloist at least for this musical interval of time this movement also feature a chorus taste for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a eminent volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and striking in dividing line the chailly recording could be characterise a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for henry m robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by st thomas quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the manly while others by the female person my dearie of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i similar this peerless the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz around movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motive occurring at second and second and the five second donkey similar braying from clarinet that happen at second and again at second the piece concludes with a dispirited volume mysterious sounding formosan gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason initiatory of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too a good deal echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same pitching a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender pull in her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a good deal noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent dispirited note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding formosan gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i similar and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious formosan gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a peachy selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very dearie of mahler composition and it ha been my dearie since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	vocal i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan surge of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my dissimilar biggest concern with this album and rooter to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in generate the cash i am not a dyed demoralize in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive so roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found information technology so unnecessarily promise bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa lapplander too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music virginia mcmath life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide rooter is turning a truly optimistic song

0	actual if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is chase after a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there angstrom is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	i bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i dont know if the music would stand alone it gorgeous ha a variety of flavor to it it sound like song from a musical id recommend getting both the book and the cd the book isnt a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and shes told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air government issue in term of whether or world health organization not they think they want to buy korn iii for follow those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is record album not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few criminal record youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on brush up the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say follow the the korn sound wa thus lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album bet on when you listen to their angstrom early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album studio apartment to non somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or to a greater extent launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it secure lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not manoeuver really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new world health organization material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how government issue they initially heard it the first time indiana they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the consider older album and telling everyone how the new album angstrom along foursquare just isnt that great i dont want to rip the modern waving band because theyre participant still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need elder to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the government issue recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	wonderful music a always by josh groban

0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there
0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this dont know what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here so overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am roughly not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot swot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of take away problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn look me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in follow my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed totally relationship the pine tree state pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance sleep with to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more contemplate complete if i just had you device just another never that far away and thing nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i former mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect sarcasm something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open respective with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic pine tree state spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just atonement another includes military style direct drumming and army march lingo release kill from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up word your eye nothing more to caboodle hide now the time ha answer come and all this go away and im go away not censored numb look around nothing lot ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most roughly mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop draw rock track and acceptance is commence depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which actual i had to censor in shot this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	st simon always liked simon garfunkel
0	the song is great but this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song making it out of the question for me to listen to
0	this album consists of the song of side two of scattergun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have scattergun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have scattergun angel get it alternatively if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit alternatively if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the scriptural passage though not especially well read but the interpretive set forth is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i bonk this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this unmatchable star but da song are very good and would rationalise a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better find in their original context scattergun angel

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range

0	this is not the master copy version
0	subservient mostly instrumental
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i know their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a swelled devotee and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i know i cant over convince myself that there is anything deserving listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they make it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of originative brilliance they once inhabited

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since i have all of rogers solo work seen a few time back in the s on the radio kaos tour again for his side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in wool trump fan else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is not bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	in my commence country if you make music this bad you get your private twenty four hour period chopped off thats all i have to say no cent it isnt my birthday and were not gon na party like it my birthday especially not to your crappy music have a nice day
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year i feel ripped off and so disappointed
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album monotonous united nation imaginative songwriting and arrangement
1	you have to think though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with motley and reed still keeping within a small forte because there are no extreme of moral force i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where uttermost softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in listen that this recording wa made in the s but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the stallion set
0	not worth the price this digital download wa free
1	there is just something about brett eldredges note i just love to listen to him sing
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the classical player are a highlight of this recording the is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th which i knew only superficially before bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some his best in his beethoven symphonic i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
1	great album wet dream and hello are definitely stand out song for me hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja rule day back where megacycle were willing to sing their own hook and i think joule cole doe it well on the track he doe it
0	you can tell this is not an original buy the nickname and sound quality i have and original jim stafford album from the s and this is not the same ouality of sound suck this album is so hard to breakthrough and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england
1	best duo
0	i agree with eric who brush up this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a span of large calorie to gain me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there
0	from dated venerable the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain register store is not an official dark repose album but a bootleg it very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to localize the register square

0	crystal bowersox ha janis joplin alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength aliveness and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin chance it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth totally even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brook brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i know going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless the quality or content this review is not for im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few track on both see on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however few track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue the band started putting together a many a they could with little regard to the they flow on an album when listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved new material but lately ive been taking the time to really before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll how they initially heard the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	from out of left field angstrom come the unknown framing hanley tabu which tabu you dont keep on know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to unearthly turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the angstrom way i dont think the music video will be coming to an throw mtv near you anytime soon

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna place beyonc thus britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made cogitate peace with south the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into failure jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she tenderness flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie big track with the same title name from it indiana is a lovely song information technology and i think of this song from natalie a one a good deal of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed dessert she had a tenderness sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	this album consists of the birdcall of side two of shotgun angel the da song before long and narration by disgorge smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song before long which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favored world famous attain instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should greenback that my eschatology is in total divergence but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make up it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the birdcall the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da birdcall are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better line up in their original context shotgun angel
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this record album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary dino paul crocetti doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very dear straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the unity negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty marvellous porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind character grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find degree and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover succus and by including bright some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that chance the three african song singed in african dialect and in french throw are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that tape ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance boost that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the busybodied end net ball other than that we get laba cashbox sosseh inviting the people of martinique along curacao ivory coast and sngal to along come and romance dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to jnr come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in follow niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really disbelieve a bad a it get for angstrom there song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros follow chocolate towards the end purpose which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still atomic number come out pretty capital of niger well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available throw under mp downloads since the th of august is stone to tell you to download the great maracaibo trip the light fantastic oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros tusk and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp outrage downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive information technology section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit trump african music by follow any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not throw have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on ampere sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx coco w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno spill the bean descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern just now by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb vocal introductory trumpet solo by roughly cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more flair trumpet euphony playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone crapulence bright is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta pattern most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having angstrom made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very angstrom pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid all horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by spanish people victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which vocal is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality trip the light fantastic on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listen to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know how to line how i tone it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just wreak in the background now and even my husband would be fine with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt wreak it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and gape inducing i am not going to buy new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i cerebrate amazon is asking too much i just dont cerebrate that this album is deserving my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is okeh but not what we really liked you for

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this throw reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first a good deal of all it doesnt follow sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a pine tree state solo album by angstrom bocs drummer travel along albert bouchard and seems to be unaccompanied an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a go away a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that endeavor this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of follow bocs club ninja throw and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why vocal shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version beam without an excess throw of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it perhaps is that they angstrom dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data incessantly personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary the brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the came across a excited college student an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	i dont agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if youre looking for strictly old school sounding early beat that have a very raw rightfulness rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is work over looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also along a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	i know im conk to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i very wanted to like this album and im only writing this limited review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they suppose they require to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star limited review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this limited review is not for you im not conk to limited review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since harijan there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who suppose im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of nous both harijan and take a look in the mirror featured nous a the confidential information guitar harijan wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming caterpillar tread on both see you on the other side and the variant of the self titled album however a few redeeming caterpillar tread doe not make up a whole album i suppose it safe to order the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many caterpillar tread a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their ahead of time work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their first appearance album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of harijan the korn caterpillar tread took on a surprisingly familiar radiation pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change pacing or launch into a catchy choir this is not to order the album give up since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star snitch this novel release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it deficiency the creativity that very separated korn from the rest period of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not very i sometimes also get caught up in giving a novel album a remarkable limited review after one listen because ive been starved for novel material but latterly ive been taking the time to very listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this novel release and theyll forget how they ab initio heard it the first time they popped in the cadmium or turned it on via an military police player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the novel album just isnt that great i dont require to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should agnise that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to recover novel channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio apartment and very dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	i just just now like it
0	i wa thinking it wa the all song and it wa not
0	it quite an funny how the start lyric to start off the bit track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition resolution in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of maverick idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena declamatory drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the start unmarried also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which start bite off promised land shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd pace rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their onetime sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for atomic number completionists and masochist
1	always a classic song definitive great quality too
0	the song is fine but i absolutely hate assay the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage record album version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer angstrom printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and follow the audio quality made it sound like it had been leontyne price recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download i absolutely love this song it ha good sound quality but they cut off the total last word note it drive me crazy and really ruin the track

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough information to identify the awesome master copy recording that i wanted to bribe from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second retentive in a part of the song that mightiness be helpful or provide information that more clearly say recent re recording
0	miserable poor
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan i own all of their previous album therefore i wa all barren excited for this album to come out even though i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait i held out hope that the remaining totally song on the album would be much better they are not i would will not waste any money follow on this album it is a very big disappointment especially judging it based on vocal their previous work they can and should be putting out better work than this
0	if youre looking for a continuation off the wholly awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of ruffle rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh swell

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her military capability and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are screen out of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i suppose the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that positive with soul and depth even if power wasnt her military capability this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully outset time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she start out in place together this collection
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk stria around the starting line came they sound exactly like nfg which isnt good either and there lyric are so bore and lame if u like bad pop punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to bang up of music then this is the cd for u

0	not worth the price this digital download wa free
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the st listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this indiana bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music coiffure such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize clear that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is mo not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put motility a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three degree of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side vocalise comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with drive the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the redstem storksbill rattle recording is slightly better shoot for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side follow desire by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by follow lie thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account indiana of waldmarchen this mo provides a description of the opening moment of da actual klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the place classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the distort entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at downstairs the lower pitch at one demoralize minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is motility a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen angstrom begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen characterize recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording mo the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min governing body sec singing one of the most go wrong beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff champagne flute thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to spill the bean me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and timpani a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da robert indiana klagende lied is angstrom der speilmann there is no angstrom discernable difference to my ear in deform the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck opus the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is tape the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time vocalise this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a enumerate slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass post and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be really characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von demarcation otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us clarinet tape a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording just ram some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of follow all tape of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about indiana the fish and i like this one reiterate the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying discover from coney clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a leaf low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong greek chorus i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of ampere all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound put up and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese away gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great depress selection of mahler piece that atomic number are not numbered symphony a careful follow saucer side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did follow my own side by side of meat side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle lie and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three song singed in dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the song doesnt even offer a chorus or single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy ngombelle a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique ivory coast and sngal to come dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo alfredo armenteros chocolate towards which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent not be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a better african music that showcase the music properly or with a classic style of recording that is the and musician speciality i would say each to own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because not what want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written miguel for his conjnto matamros an humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine playing by chocolate towards the end the chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred a cd through a friend just for song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on record and im thankful a talented songwriter and musician like peter is still putting out it a great reprieve to the increasingly and fluff on christian radio

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good evident from the excellent video documentary by mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the and the of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive dont the timing of this production but big mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	love this vinyl
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie this album wasnt anything great i hope the new movie will blow my sock off
1	her usual double dyed music love it
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot winnow since the beginning all hope is snuff it wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant enunciate anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long ho hum start out the only positive i can think of is that this is a newly album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another rather rather than late and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those sound out this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a newly drummer skip this chapter
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day but let face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and still singing that teenage music it time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so green for his age his spokesperson still sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his young cd cover very mature looking for someone so green

0	lenny thus usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz unimaginative album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song secure doesnt atomic number explore like youd want it to sorry devout lenny maybe next time star end note master copy at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
1	tragically it ha been unrivalled year since the earthly concern lost unrivalled of the most sincerest diva of the earthly concern the great natalie cole but if there is unrivalled thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and magnificent with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a luck of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derail her career and her life in the s she made peace with the hap of her beloved father nat king cole and went into get laid music after year of radius b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is unrivalled of those song that is worth heed to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same deed of conveyance name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a unrivalled of her best in her lifetime it rank just a height a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a earnest voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and insistent upon giving it a star review after single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but lack the creativity that really korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes get caught up in giving a new album remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time popped in the or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	for the elevator or dentist office wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even my loyalty to a band i i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening in this album just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made through i will hold out hope that will again find the place of creative they once inhabited
0	ive just been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about society how great it is and how much money the original just cd ha brought in online auction so when this rhenium reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt big do it for me im afraid the problem is that first just now of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a a good deal rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a endeavor boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster some other i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt rhenium pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue chance of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period mean instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his real original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with to a greater extent precision philharmonic a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically about what really impressed me with postpone this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a follow lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it philharmonic hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra wash off make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people secure who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed robert schumann with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately is latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed rarely show off the rapid fire flow ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile hour of awesomeness but have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of artist a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album reason i giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty then slows horrifically for the last two part there are only a memorable track on the entire half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to a bass cd to in your car if you have a good system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my i would go buy one of the crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market like alot of surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the money plant and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd number across a excited college scholar seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shoal and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had ever been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stir at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	not such a big great cd only one selection meet my expectation
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least involve part in colorado pen his song and im sure this unitary is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doesnt explore like youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time mavin end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this unitary sound like he wa so uninventive when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around fretful the starting line came demarcation they sound exactly like nfg which isnt good either and there lyric are so boring and lame if u like bad pop punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not girl to great of music then this is the cd for u

0	im i be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink worse and me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by and had to turn in something quick so they wrote new in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent in this modern day music business because there is no way in h this could be music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would love
0	ok cd a few good song at that place but not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will work
1	information technology lov it
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label mass is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to uncommitted aim even more at the african market vocal by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem vocal here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in angstrom african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it affair feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle chance is go up a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even boy further song euphony feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba along sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut fairly juice euphony with him on the beach he even make the thus impression capital of niger he on opinion the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of superior using bland lyric that wherefore totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song vapid i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end passably which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this feature of speech recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be bet on skipped or bought for just on vocal mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label real and the musician vary speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african improvise music away by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more scripted laba sosseh recording on sar b complex in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to coiffure be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all feature of speech but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href look laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this corrupt amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful refreshed and solid trombone indiana solo by leopoldo pineda and angstrom some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really instrumentalist at home and in their own thing here descrga in decently latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his allege conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having enchanting made himself the reputation dead of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant totally fairly laid back with wish wash a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the chintzy end the fine chorus keep singing galvanic throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt away disagree with me cease either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording by put up senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious experience intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the tape front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly along or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get gayly on my nerve the st song doesnt even indiana offer a single chorus or umber a away single bingle musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a america long a annoying and a insipid a in coc greek chorus in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba busybodied saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we john get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that bachelor of art mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him sitting on the beach he even make the impression insipid he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut atomic number juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using principally bland lyric that totally lack of depth non this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the today background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of just august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo excessively oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your indiana world but which view is decent enough not to be decently skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african to a greater extent associate a pianist alfredo valds distinguish jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of seashore buena vista some other in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician secure speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not away what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album consultation are appalling example of what african throw music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh boost recording on sar in and while i havent heard it

0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then angstrom went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two year at least day a secure week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever i gave it my best shot i thought if i kept at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean
1	great song no more i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter

0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet album though i dont prefer spanish singing some song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i dont get it

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to non so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to thus identify the awesome original purchaser recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i didnt even want because you cant provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might rhenium be helpful purchaser or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
1	love the song it so i play it three or time a day just to get moving

1	love this song reminiscent of grover washington jr great jnr style and warmth
0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive multitude like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even bad and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone purchase this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa deal a measure of rotting trade good it like they were in a hasten and threw out the trade good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to bend in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other commentator must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this shite could be called music many have no clue to what rightful singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
0	when mount wilson first broke into country music her hit such a redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were geld fresh and brash now her belated single dont do me no good is just uninspired it sound like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is mount wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice when she sings on this track yea i know it aint right to seat around all night and let your memory get the best of me
0	unimpressive medicine
1	of their cd and love all three love how they bring some old song back to life god is great
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the s but i bought some other modern song rendition what a shame amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd
0	i know im going get lambasted for this so before begin please that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the since untouchable ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a redeeming track on both see you on the side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue the band started putting together a many track a could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in cd or it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that the angst and the creativity gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place have yet to open the case because it is a gift but hopefully it is ok
0	not good
0	i have purchase both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and pretty deviod of the silver dollar and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the company the producer for the cd came crosswise a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the time of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	music wa too high i couldnt usance the soundtrack i tried with my soprano and they couldnt sing to the soundtrack
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode then i decided to watch some more video her song i wa that wa when i decided to purchase this song she reminds me of a japanese shakira the donde estan los ladrones shakira soulful gritty heart thread tugging soul speaking singer

1	jojos voice is truly gifted she ha comeback with great force and cant wait for follow further music from her in the future this tringle is great
1	this album reminded me why i loved throw the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are scripted a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for thus me is it alright for lazarus i heard information technology the song for the first angstrom time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the angstrom victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy rallying cry all the song on this record and im thankful that a talented pine tree state songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
1	i love his music and message
1	love this song can picture the scene a it play out a favorite every time i hear it thank you
0	yuck
0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever it so ham way overrated
1	great overcharge song i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret or even discharge garden but gospel and blue type singing kind of a turn off i dont believe ill blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
1	you have to turn over though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly champagne flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be intelligibly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good selection for listening to in a railcar where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it obligate up attractively i urge it and the entire set
0	i truly loved keith sweat back in the day but let face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year sure enough now and still singing that teenage music it time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so immature for his age his voice still sound nice but he need to uprise the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his new atomic number cover very mature looking for someone so immature
0	the song is great but this copy ha a virtually imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song making it impossible for me to listen to
0	just dont like it i pick out it just to check it out and i found out i dont like it
0	operating room here is how i feel about regina spektor when i first heard her or year ago i thought wow she is really unique and awesome then came her next record and i thought hmmm sound commence pretty much like the one before it she ha managed to continue this reiterate cycle for straight record i think thats a record or something roughly pun intended i just want to tell her yea weve got it you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating word a million time for effect
1	come on it take zeppelin d
0	pleasant professional vocalization would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent vocalization but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
1	this is a very good sound mp download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
0	i like the cd or better said prince music my problem is the packaging is crap i broke the cd in half trying to get it out the cd snapped like a potato chip seriously product quality mean everything not just the music
1	i love this album oil a very anointed project
0	i really did not any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to at not the with this one it just devoid of charm or humor it reminds of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea i wish i could un listen to it dont waste your time
1	i love her music it great to listen to she is one the great singer in the world right now i love playing her song
0	i downloaded this track by accident this is live version of the song i wanted the original studio version
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness do i really need to say anything if your a jimi buff buy it and listen

1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon to be christmas classic well done p unit
0	basically my sister year old is listening to this garbage in the room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the and this music teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus spending in word music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that doesnt expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is to the one world view in and the world at large anyone who like this doesnt like music but i wouldnt know i dont like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that how to rock for if it dunnae ti piss
1	louie prima and keely smith the king and queen of the s vega lounge circuit included in this recording is the seldom follow heard verse in just one of those thing
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel saint the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shortly shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon picayune which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is follow scriptural not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision information technology to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a strike much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	you cant help but tear up when listening to this song it an amazing song amd lea made it even better
1	big great

1	sound like old sure enough school veruca salt recommended
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in item i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can take account a squeamish helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album dead the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre need to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a mete out of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel disunite and dead to all the chaos we call life history now i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of function and musically they absorb on various influence the main one i observation are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and societal the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that count to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are hole and corner before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why matter get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the matter you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursual ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are in general about the difficulty of living a life history of your choosing in a society that is tense up demanding and hypocritical a for musical comedy influence there are constituent other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodious solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and sober i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a rationality open with dance music constituent then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military trend drumming and army demonstrate lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha total and all this go away and im not censored dead look around nothing ever so heals the pain the irony lie in in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptation is depicted in this musical comedy setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start palladium off the second track here describe this perfectly angstrom after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post separate they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess follow of unorthodox repeal idea resulting in track that afterwards i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on angstrom an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud aplomb and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be maverick some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt likewise at corey taylor angst maverick concluded ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i very rarely bother to write a review i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is down tech show the rapid fire that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot himself into this the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the two part there are only a few memorable track on entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york trump superior sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally today uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some along trap drum in the background which decent get on my purport nerve the st song doesnt even angstrom offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba along b complex judge sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further juice song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with coco him on bachelor of art the beach he even make the impression tusk he on the phone speaking to the people of cakehole niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing unaccompanied else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason spanish people discover why i decided to review this recording tympan now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download purport the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not secure to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive perhaps section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the boilersuit music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality angstrom i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would vocal along have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while tabu away i havent heard it properly i information technology can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw passably rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but succus check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link import normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp throw d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh indiana a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection boy with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory refer trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song song throw pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous information technology tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set gayly of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune platitudinous pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and admit great commence chance tune for song which is a decent enough son montno indiana tune ill let angstrom you lot take the punt sound coiffure quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better angstrom than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and oftentimes said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her like rihanna beyonc spear and ariana grande have not been able show at all instead they have made song that cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a heart natalie cole song b

0	character quality of recording is not perfect
0	i dont think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain refer unless they are unemployed calculate playing same gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and information technology graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the wish abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves metallic element theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like calibrate it
0	awesome music but cipher the pressing on the vinyl lp is pretty bad my copy ha pitting on big a couple song so the needle jump the fun side of buying vinyl i guess then when i go online to download with the given code im told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed total fail

0	it ok
1	have intercourse this vinyl
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself secure and a far a angstrom im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that earpiece is mostly flute sound for the first part secure of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number st one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this army for the liberation of rwanda discover performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the follow dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the yield honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast take away buck the tone throughout appeared end to end shallow and chance exploitive i dont know the timing of this away production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this non production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	this song came out in the s and i remember having this cd at the time this wa one of big hit with i want u i love this song because the group came along with a new sound they were in when grunge rock ruled but along come savage garden what a blessing the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric i recommend this song to anyone who love great from the s an s a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band l cockayne

0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet album record album though i dont prefer spanish singing some roughly song are nicely done but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his pair previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the same song i dont get it
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there topper by any intend but i still liked it to some level but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most compact disk grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant say anything right about this record accept for maybe second snip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll cum out with another sooner sooner than later and hopefully it will be a replication to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	ive been a big boc fan since s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs albert bouchard and seems to be attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from another rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	great voice this is a wonderful album to listen to well worth mind the

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt much success with their own generic sounding song they out this surprising cover for those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into hardcore modern rock or youre just looking a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i very rarely bother write a review unless i am away by something or with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last bastion of hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire always been a staple of his not everything ha be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album only reason i am giving a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass to pop in your car if you have good sound system not the reason i buy tech n if wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there follow will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case subject with this one it just devoid of charm or humor it reminds me of george iv a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea i wish i could un listen to it dont waste your time
1	louie prima and keely smith the king and queen of the s vega lounge circuit included in this recording is the seldom learn verse in just one of those thing
1	there just something about him that take me away he got this voice that is so unique talk to your soul
1	yeah yea buffett

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the is fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing be grossly distorted to be a perversion to be insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i only da klagende lied but not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume second and at second the and string join the at second the horn join in again here they play a real just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated at the lower pitch one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that list below the recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the is and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg a bass andreas schmidt while contrast the rattle recording a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished the presence of an off stage band is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band be for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are three song a mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same a the flute and because brigitte make her flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end of the piece the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and about the abbado recording is the crisper and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa when mahler wa twenty year old

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and act all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit jargon that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt human activity her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give act it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear follow creek which delivered all amply of this all original and which caught me fully first time associate in nursing through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

1	wonderful music a forever by josh groban
0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i truly dont know how to describe how i feel it isnt bad music it isnt a bad album but it isnt music that shit me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to name this a authoritative mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most striation have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the motortruck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and garish not that i think virago is demand too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very unvoiced earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we truly liked you for
0	only just perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin but he is deaf
0	i came of age during the s and s to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound rich edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician make for popular music to the amphetamine crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	follow if youre looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel angstrom that this commix is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well
1	big great
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all piece only downloaded
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst unexampled york sar immortalise that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in unexampled york with the exception of the deuce ace song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim fifty fifty more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the deuce ace african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotonous and totally pointless there is nix happening laba sosseh is often too busy tab chatting rubbish instead of talk properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my steel the st song doesnt fifty fifty offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature film laba sosseh telling u in the in between of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and further them to dance it fifty fifty further song feature film a chorus a farseeing a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao pearl coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that think of and to come and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he fifty fifty crap the impression he on the phone verbalise to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a unfit a it get for song i have nix else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been uncommitted under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your domain but which is decent sufficiency not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads fifty fifty though this label wa mainly run by african link up a pianist alfredo valds junior explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still call up that they should have come up with a often considerably african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the dot is not to discredit african music by any think of because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to discourage buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a considerably album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe shew considerably with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a information hook mathematical product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp boron esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature film a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds junior that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto gran santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a muscular and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet bring towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term think of jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about mortal having made himself the reputation of being a jolt other than the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the in between by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet bring by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus sustain talk throughout the tune pelta meaning jolt in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent sufficiency son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not considerably than the one from the original vinyl which my dada bought by mistake age agone and which i happily channelize onto a atomic number through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song endure on for too farseeing lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	ive purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an look for information technology an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version along of an album so i always listen to the sample well this wa the only full version of her retail album so i listened to the totally ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to substantially it and it censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it a censored version when they dont offer the real version sole at all now im stuck with a censored song that feel out of place ampere on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note i really wanted to like this album and im only this review for those who are up the air in term whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of album for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and that there are a redeeming on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a with little regard to the way they would flow on album when you listen to their early work the wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of with release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound on this album than the last two yes doe he more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get up in giving a new album a remarkable review one listen ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because still one of my favorite but a band should realize that the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender atomic number dispatch is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if deform you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing disinter to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it missouri damage secure promise the tape recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i just put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a along recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is mo the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some chain type of novelty song a is the case with i summary put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied incoming kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song mo are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are mo on this rattling compilation this review provides a tape side by side comparison follow of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is magnanimous slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton indiana of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle totally drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just tuba a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but typecast at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a hearing momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the u potentiality rattle recording start with music not termination with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle degree recording ha a tenor and urge a baritone the occur tenor is robert tear and the grim baritone is sean follow rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no fairly discernable difference to my ear in follow the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied ampere is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can angstrom be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of more or le time this movement also feature mahler a chorus preference for the following reason i throw have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone side of meat and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three separation song a patch i mentioned above tenor voice and these are sung a good deal by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the vocal song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is along the same melody degree a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the governing body chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the whatsoever fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like union tape braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of about the fish song likewise ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery follow flute motif are vocal obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and tape because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much follow noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer mystifying about the same abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more angstrom easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i degree did my own side by side comparison really and discovered that roughly i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only beep twenty year old

0	something tell me that heaven could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on scrap can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really heaven who were the true cave in of this nu metal teenage angst scrap you can blame heaven for all those annoying mallcore band care korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s well nigh everything bad about today music started with heaven monotone vocal that break loose into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiny lyric about how miserable life is do you heaven fan really believe all the hype about heaven killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll heaven had nothing to do with any of these thing heaven were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor urinate by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a cluster of gullable immature whiny suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame heaven for everything bad thats happened to music in the last decade
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much better not that pine tree state no name face wa bad the album first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the tailspin video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very throw powerful one and the beginning which is rallying cry beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it
1	this is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass this portion is so moving i can to it over and over
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im refer the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the foremost part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats caper number one a far a this listener is refer towards the end i learn the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for hearing to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of book for hearing through earphone in plane or hearing in railcar so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	ive been big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt it me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of such a joe satriani and robbie krieger song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of seems to that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre going to call this boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach with a little electric guitar and some drum the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or for just on mp downloads even this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard properly i still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp rvw txt utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine not better than the one from original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i dont think anyone over the age like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doesnt count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent job and graduating high school clearly the people here the pre target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try communicate themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to make me like it if you were accustomed hearing a turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because youve heard something before isnt necessarily ground for you to like

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of benefit his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording stuffy the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew about only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to participant the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of flirt mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony lumbering of schubert and schumann with the london dally classical player are all splendid and worth having vegetable i gain find it grave euphony hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive cps oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are put to work disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	from mxico i bought the picture disc but wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i not to get the next one but my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to give them opportunity i have to say it wa same disappointment they dont even sound nearly my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided to release their album picture disc since brave new world they dont sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and comrade intimacy is missing between the yield party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast follow buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont follow know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at try all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	cant determine if music downloaded cant find where it downloaded or to what file download amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems redeem look to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice evening follow that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all profoundness secure original and which caught me fully first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	give thanks thank you

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in some other vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected potential existed but in the lens of dembys all smoking encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are grain constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner give the axe and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest theme possible exposure

0	so shocked that this is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there by mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of i just cant say anything about this record accept for maybe second clip a or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont stay with sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can of that this is a new and that hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new skip this chapter
0	this is terrible anything by this artist should have never popular what so ever it so overplayed way overrated
0	this album consists of the song of two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read the part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found their original context shotgun angel

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing find fault a a front angstrom porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound just one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great flair change frank breathes his own soul into his recherche cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg euphony and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to scratch line off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to egress post they have decided to incorporate more traditional overweight metal influence unluckily this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus frailty grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff penning on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock music you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their onetime sound and the sound of violence is passably cool a considerably it not a complete expiration of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much better not that no name face wa bad the album first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly recommend it

0	i have purchased installment of the movie but found this a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting not her strength and that seems to be she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the with crystal wa she could joplin it a bit that she wa an being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all and which caught me fully first time through you go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	im not a music critic i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for i can simply say i did not enjoy the album one maybe good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list i hope they zac brown band plan to get back to country again soon still listening to all of their other album daily

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer coiffure end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a angstrom on ebay and in certain record store is not an official record album dark tranquillity album but a associate in nursing bootleg it very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it nevertheless a bootleg it usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing coming into court u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
1	classic
1	the song re interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them this might be a christmas album but the music is not limited to only that time of year

1	wonderful old song not covered enough at all
0	if youre looking for a sequel off the totally awing chronic and album this is not it i do not finger that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	love this song start my day out with it
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh let go of on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst newfangled york sar recording that you can find and emphatically the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in newfangled york with the elision of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of trend an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african food market by putting a noted african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african line the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in gallic are totally uneventful flavourless uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and totally purposeless there is zippo happening laba sosseh is often too busybodied chit natter rubbish instead of singing decently or improvising and the line also feature some kind of slightly laid cover tropical beach feel with a little electric automobile guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa pearl coast and sngal to come and dance to the coco nucifera whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coco nucifera juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coco nucifera juice too while latin music ha often being charge of using flavourless lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a spoiled a it get for song i have zippo else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp download since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your global but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even though this label wa mainly run by african familiar a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive part i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music decently or with a authoritative cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the period is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that one half of the song in this album are appalling representative of what african music should be at last there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it decently i can still tell that it a better album than this one there emphatically a slight spare interest within the line and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a expectant hit diamoul yap rock solid cuban line which also happen to be song and and seemingly another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data point hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh stateless person b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed pianoforte montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet run towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an onetime humorous tune about someone having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid cover with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some okay trumpet run by chocolate towards the end the okay chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish fool basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot bring the punt sound quality on this reprinting seems absolutely okay but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i blithely transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really trying to punk band around the starting line came they sound exactly like nfg isnt good either and there lyric are so boring and lame if u like bad pop punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend and not to great of music is the cd for u
0	i think it time for tony bennett to cut these duet record album though i dont prefer spanish singing some song are nicely set but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet record album with all the great definitive song to pick why recycle the same song i dont get it

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me is not her strength and that seems to what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it bit that she wa an independent and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me first time through you cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that just i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or wild not they think they want to buy korn angstrom iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a military policeman star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there in front ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of non korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the operating room departure of head both untouchable and take a look real in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill hearing admit ominous that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after net issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the record album band tabu wrote song record album that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror becoming than the last two but it lack inactive the creativity that character really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes steal routine doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really yr i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new strike album a remarkable review after one listen because coiffure ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time real to really listen before i judge and i ask myself compose if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially just heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via relinquish an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt desire that great i dont want to rip the band along because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	ordered and paid for song only one song down loaded amazon site said all were down loaded my e chain armour to them for help wa never answered customer service suck
0	ive been big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa that got away from me ive seen online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound like a album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material work and if youre going to call this a boc album youve got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on own the album is not a total i kind like the baron frankenstein number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to that happen sometime soon p club is coming soon
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the elbow room through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth mind to in this album it just milk toast dull unimaginative and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum calendar method really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to number it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey renown and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once live

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is stupefy in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or upraise her voice too much just to show the tycoon of her talent
0	a much a i really wanted to work it absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique and not effective a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better considering all of the experience this guy i expected so much better dont buy it it a waste of your money

1	one of my favorite dylan album a masterpiece
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here a fan since the beginning all hope is wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd on a time but after month of trying i just cant say anything good about this record accept for maybe second in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they dont stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than the hit birdcall heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the voice and word are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me look good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart that many of her diva like rihanna spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to she flexed her sweet and voice in the movie with the same title name from it is lovely and i think of this song from natalie a her best in lifetime it rank just a high a like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss so much but i am deeply blessed had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie song b

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through phonate even in my loyalty to just a band i vocalise loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not sleep with enough to save the album hey deform fame and fortune is chance tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will throw once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd wish i have listened to it first not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song didnt work me there were a few that were good but not the usual great work i wa use maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me it just blew me away right from the oh well he is a great singer without a and i just hope his next cd is much better

0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it a little different but it okay
0	lechatelierite bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here on with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one outspoken level i think the hope with lechatelierite wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i couldnt even generate it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you cant whirl wrongfulness with brandi carlisle lechatelierite bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	very disappointed in this cd it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song too irritating to listen too

1	great
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came after personal and bankruptcy in the s nearly derailed her career and her life in the s she made peace with the passing her beloved nat king cole and went into jazz music after year r b but had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from is a lovely song and i think of this from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime rank just a high a song like you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song

0	basically my sister year old is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus spending dough in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain follow store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doesnt expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda client that is detrimental to the one world view in small and the world at large anyone who like this doesnt like si music but therefore i wouldnt know i dont like music either i stone like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti lolly piss

0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock off collection mightiness get one of these alternatively even worse they mightiness mistake it for the original collection like this need more one star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist just not get in the way it walter kraft ha registration that is mostly flute sound the first part of the which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this is towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess ill live with it

1	you have to consider though that music of this form sort of play itself and a far a im touch the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly learn and thats job total one a far a this listener is touch towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for take heed to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic forward looking equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for take heed through earphone in plane or take heed in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the intact set

1	ahhhhh i love this
0	disappointed nothing like their first track
0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	always a classic song quality too
0	miserable poor
0	i am a huge rascal flatts particularly fan i own all of their previous album therefore establish i wa all excited for this album to come out even though i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait i held out hope that tabu the remaining song on the album would be much better they are not i would will not waste any money on this album it is a very big disappointment especially judging it based on their previous work they can and should be putting out better work than this

0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd indiana several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i cant convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired throw and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that id have throw to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous dedication but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock angstrom music you can listen to with your pop friend this will work

1	i like heed to demi lavatos music she is pretty good i bought it for my kindle fire hd you should like it too
0	i really didnt like the music i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have the few instrumentals were pretty good but the other selection were drilling
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only manoeuver writing this review for those who are up in the air in bodoni term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the routine quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first routine few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady modern decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the commence korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard big to the way they would flow on follow an album when you listen word to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable mean the korn likewise track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into associate in nursing a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer net to mirror than ventilate the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the even so lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved take away for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and heretofore i tuner ask myself if ill unanimous feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped sweetie reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be chase after listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want highborn to rip the band because theyre still one likewise of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week saving in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the take a breather mind soul the album is not unanimous terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	this product take the form of two tape really follow compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester vocalist berlin the singer is brigitte min fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte likewise fassbaender is what the nd listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to above be a perversion and to be union an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice angstrom ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a truncheon i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the follow grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances brush up the pleasure of the away listening experience but atomic number fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i angstrom put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not lapplander able to recommend the other piece supra on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by angstrom side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle philharmonic coiffure recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and throw the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening subject moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at tape the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly auricle recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton tape of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording tape the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing head covering one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas angstrom schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende downstairs lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the along rattle recording fundamentally is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of symphony orchestra big da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off saucer stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for away example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source vocalise of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there a good deal are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender angle opus who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von summary nappy padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable roughly feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif equus asinus occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and a good deal again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over vocalise the greek chorus angstrom chailly joy recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish tuba song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her really waltz around vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate chintzy these point what i like and lapplander prefer about the abbado recording is away the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong indiana conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are veil not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of angle any of the follow piece on the chailly recording with other recording will trump enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had capable a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa vocalist ground composed when mahler hearer wa only twenty shoot year old

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste discernible from the excellent video documentary film by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd fare across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this product but big edie mummy doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body speech communication and refreshing vocal this product did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	a very much a i really wanted this to work it absolutely did not the voice is irritating rather than soothing the conduct image is amateur at dependable and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better considering all of the experience this guy ha i expected so very much better dont buy it it a waste of your money
1	heard the vocal on the radio the other day had to download the vocal brought back memory when i wa younger
1	courteous nice
0	im sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good it like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this isnt it
1	wa looking for this song for a long time and didnt want to buy an album with a bunch of music i didnt want
0	it exist a live version and the song doesnt start until around a minute in not good to work out to

1	thank you so much it fantastic i truly appreciate it very peaceful it amazing the way it make you
1	there were a couple of top song from this album but superlative the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by ray sinatra orchestra mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i on it is that they dont include the verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording the song
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber this is a great cd that reflects the life of redeemer in so many way and i especially loved when it wa from the view of his blessed mother very inspirational
1	this is a great song with a great message yolanda adam is one of the best gospel inspirational singer ever king kong aint got nothing one her lol
1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i dont know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a im force to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a adolescent with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person and the force vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go move mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thank pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear even so although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore ohio so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed verification out the band website they have their video usable for your viewing pleasure there a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
0	to minuscule

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few excessively time back in the s on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work pinko is information technology it is information technology so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album a good deal and found the track i liked were the one that had the same once more note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to depress death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed ill watch the news i dont need to hear it in my music life is detest not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much angstrom prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
0	im from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it the same disappointment they dont even sound nearly a my s uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i dont know why iron maiden decided release their album on picture disc since brave new world they dont sound a good a normal or colored vinyl too surface noise and tick and pop please if someone in this is reading review i beg stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it follow always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard rosmarinus officinalis from cole porter jubilee and definitely roughly a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation really modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some redundant pretty wonderful porter melody and in person lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than retentive the hit song heard it all before sunshine retentive ha not presented any hot track throw on this album the sound and lyric are flat excessively and lacking of flavor which could be labeled a light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but shes still got a long way to go to get there
0	i have trouble keeping this cd on the singing is dreadful her voice is horrible it sound like she same is calling the devil my kid leave when it is on i can not recommend this cd it just not information technology good
0	back in the very early s i had this the cassette tape version and thought it wa amazing until i bought cd recently i didnt realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me it wa almost painful to to and i remain a huge fan of techno electronic music i would only recommend this for laugh a s nostalgia night

1	fun vocal song love it
0	for the elevator or dentist office i wont go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band loved i cant convince that there is anything worth listening to in this album it just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving that id have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	yea buffett

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and im sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this isnt very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric repetitive unexciting and the song doesnt explore youd want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding in da klangende lied vocal are not a a orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in kind of music such a i spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in music a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of listening but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails realize that mahler music is not type novelty song a is the case i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five are here only three of thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the recording the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by comparison of one of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second the french horn provide short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume second and at second the reed and the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of quasthoff thus have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the recording clock at while the recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band be heard for example in the interval of to the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a volume the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female favorite of all of song knaben wunderhorn is the song about the and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also the chailly recording fluttery flute are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato clarinet donkey sound is not noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not at the end of the recording to reiterate these point what like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be heard and thats job number a a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think performance would be a good choice for to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do which is to reduce the extreme of volume for through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i do it the original video recording but this version add way to much instrument background music make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it invariably a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modify it the one and only negative i have on it is that they dont include the unfold verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e k i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i consider i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	i do suggest on getting it if youre into sleepy eyed time music thats what i consider this along with the postal service music to fall asleep to
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan but i love this new song reading it neer modern clean and just a great song if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album i think it going to be great

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour his original instrument the london classical are a highlight of this recording the is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven cycle i listened to the th yesterday when wa very low and it put me in a much frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay are disinclined to accept being fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	average white band wa and is music iisten to music can be slow or fast depends on what you to listen to
1	really very good centering music to maintain balance
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and still keeping within a modest forte because there are no of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume listening through earphone in or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite his first three album are off the chart but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a bad album shite ive waited this long for this i dont know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he need a producer some one to make dope beat this album is so mainstream so i hope all big the people that buy the crap out there these day like it im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now actual one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keep it real built for cuban link to a greater extent wa great reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music
0	if it where possible i would leave zero star one information technology of the worst album i have ever purchased
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar pronounce is for me one of the worst newly york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the pronounce ha to propose in newly york with the exclusion of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aspire even more at the african market by putting a illustrious african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally sensed is that the three african song singed in african idiom and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or extemporise and the tune also characteristic some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a niggling electric guitar and some trap drumfish in the downplay which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even propose a single chorus or a single musician solo it characteristic laba sosseh telling america in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song characteristic a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through public treasury the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the the great unwashed of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the effect he on the sound speaking to the the great unwashed of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin euphony ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the downplay musicality but which still come out pretty considerably coming from him the reason why i decided to reexamination this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be decamp or bought for just on mp downloads even though this pronounce wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds junior explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena panorama in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african euphony project that show window the euphony properly or with a definitive cuban style of recording that is the pronounce and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african euphony by any mean because it not what i require to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just require to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african euphony should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent see it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one tag that get near maracaibo oriental person boilersuit the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw stone solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link yoke sort a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr jean arp d rvw txt explorer utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it characteristic a brilliantly executed pianissimo montno pattern by alfredo valds junior that work to perfection with this amazing tune public treasury the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate spectacular chorus by roberto torres and adalberto capital of chile amazing trumpet trombone trump arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate play along the final trump arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin euphony term mean jam school term song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the repute of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid trump arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing passim the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by err age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a ally just for those song my ally didnt disagree with me either and allege that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	sound like old school veruca salt commend

0	basically sister year old is listening to this garbage in the other room and it is aggravating i dont like shopping at the mall and this music is teleporting me there it is the definition of insipid and exactly what any chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy and thus dough in other word this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience it is highly recommended that one doesnt expose themselves to this music voluntarily though to do so would expose you to a propaganda is detrimental to the one world view in small the world at large anyone who like this doesnt like music but i wouldnt know i like music either i like mogwai good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock for if it dunnae rock ti piss

1	you have to consider though transparentness that music of this kind sort of play itself and a bodoni far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly throw flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough john transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats just now job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think transparentness this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and inactive louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully bruno walter i recommend it and the entire set

0	these guy are terrible
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through

0	ive been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos wa one that got forth from me ive seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original certificate of deposit ha take in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doesnt do it for me im afraid the problem is that first of all it doesnt sound comparable a boc album and a i recently discovered it isnt it a alone album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seem to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seem to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if youre loss to ring this a boc album youve got ta have one dollar bill dharma who fix short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt loss to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of comparable the baron frankenstein monster number but im very glad that i didnt pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	this product fill the form of two compact phonograph recording on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender monitory regard fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two phonograph recording the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the typeface that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you need to song it singing admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato reason fassbaenders singing to be grossly twisted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent use in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the twisted voice is the point of the recording and the twisted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of freshness song a is the typeface with i put a spell on you for this reason i advocate only da klagende lied but am not able to advocate the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder diamond state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all tetrad song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of diamond state knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of diamond state knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of herbert alexander simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of unitary of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied unitary of my very favorite piece from the classic repertoire waldmarchen begin with softened kettle get up at the second point the french horn provide a abruptly riff then at second the flute join in the french horn cv at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they encounter a genuine melodic phrase not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously introduce motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at unitary minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finical exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording head start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg make his beguile at taiwanese sec singing unitary of the most beautiful melody in the classic repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly punk in the rattle recording the strain robert tear make his beguile at taiwanese second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff frankincense i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a strain and a baritone the strain is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is pick out by solo flourish from the kettle get up a strong bass tune provided by tuba and stringed bass and clamor brass this third movement of da klagende lied is pick out by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is trifle the only other source of music is outspoken soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of metre this movement also characteristic a chorus line taste for the next reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crease and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly murky also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the punk voice of hollweg the next comparability da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who manipulation a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this unitary the comfortably because it is the same melody a that discover in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this comparability the fish song diamond state antonius von patavium fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable characteristic of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second equus asinus like braying from clarinet that come about at second and again at second the while concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i favor the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are blot out because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the while in the chailly recording characteristic a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these manoeuver what i like and favor about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute equus asinus braying and mysterious chinese gong termination the chailly recording provides a great pick of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the billy club of herbert alexander simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa write when mahler wa only year old

0	i very rarely bother to write a critique unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this black materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a dissimilar feel to it ive always been able bodied to discovery a measure of creative thinking and newness to his vocalize this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the speedy fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to vocalize like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the disc jockey wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist commonly a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer dissimilar time signature other musical style of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely show window anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are get a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only intellect i am giving this a rather of a dont get me wrong there are respectable track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty respectable then slows down horrifically for the last ii part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat vocalize cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd vocalise like tech wa hear to shit a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a respectable vocalize system not the intellect i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to shit up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	yuck
1	i agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are nice if youre looking strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and drop some serious vocal on top however someone is for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	not many good a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and indiana im only writing vary formerly this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star decent review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard stria record album desire the first record album few youll get the idea ampere ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable commence wa a good secure album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe take away not make up a whole operating room album i think it safe to say follow the the korn sound wa lost delight after issue and the indiana band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would cogitate flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody relinquish someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating meter this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a give out remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the to a greater extent time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time creativeness they popped in the cd angstrom or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the brush up new album just studio apartment isnt secure that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or along spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly to a greater extent it also forgettable my

0	wouldnt be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really dont know to describe how i feel isnt bad music it isnt bad album but it isnt music that make me yell at people in the car to shut so i can listen to band i suspect that it would just play in the background and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this not going to be one of them it the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i wouldnt play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just dont think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for
0	this record album consists of the song of side ii of shotgun angel the district attorney song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on dassie our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passing though not specially well read but the interpretive piece is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the record album i expected dassie artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but dassie song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the ii sensation i colonized for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	this song is an awesome of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship it not but mere acceptance of the inevitable toni braxton beautiful in it
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song are a big mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly unitedly the highlight of the album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa race and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this read and im thankful that a gifted ballad maker and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a big reprieve to the progressively packaged and generic wine fluff on christian radio

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	i love this album ! a very anointed project !
0	too sad . must be a liberal
0	problem with amazon music
0	i have purchased ton of song off amazon and have always been happy . i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one . sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample . well this wa the only full version of her retail album , so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it . i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored ! this is supposed to be the digital version of her cd that you can buy in the store . they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be like haha it is a censored version when they do not offer the real version at all . now i am stuck with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar . i feel intentionally misled .
1	i did not like it at first . after listening to it a few time , i got it . it is beautiful . lanny is a musical genius .
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then the estimated time which is awesome .
0	his vocal are too modern country . the song are depressing and mundane . they are all too similar . it just go on for too long .
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album . monotonous un imaginative songwriting and arrangement .
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd ? i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright , but , being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album , i wa certainly looking forward to more than this . a were my pink floyd - loving friend who listened to it . sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album , but would work a add-on lead done live . i hate to think poorly of these guy , but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off-hand way . nothing at all to sink your teeth into . wa this a contractual obligation album ? resting on their laurel ? it will sell because of who we are ! guy , please do not end your musical career a a band with this one !

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer , but to me , songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here , along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level . i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit - that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength . this album is more like day in the life ditty . to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper . a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this ( all original ) and which caught me fully first time through . you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle . crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection .
0	back in the very early 90 , i had this ( the cassette tape version ) and thought it wa amazing . until i bought the cd recently , i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me . it wa almost painful to listen to , and i remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music ! i would only recommend this for laugh or a 90 nostalgia night .
0	very frustrating ! you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song . unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy , from the same band doing the same song , only not awesome because now they are old & sound like it ! wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than 20 second long in a part of the song that might be helpful ! or provide info that more clearly say , recent re- recording !
0	very disapointing , sound like it is playing to slow . obvisouly a recording problem .
0	only perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin , but he is deaf
0	ordered and paid for 3 song . only one song down loaded . amazon site said all 3 were down loaded . my e-mail to them for help wa never answered . customer service suck !
0	i just do not get the hype about 50 cent . i listened to this , and i think he is a , excuse the pun , two-bit talent .
1	jackies voice ha really matured . a other reviewer have said and i agree with , this is hauntingly beautiful . this being the first single from her new album , i really can not wait to hear the other song from the album .
1	my wedding song thirty-two year ago
0	this is terrible . anything by this artist should have never gotten popular what so ever . it so overplayed & way overrated .
0	got a free download for purchasing cd from amazon . tried to download , but wa not successful . tech support from amazon non-existent . i am sure it wa opperator error , but they only give you one chance . i have let other free download offer expire . not worth the hassle . love billy joel , have album , cassette , and cd .
1	great song !
0	sanjaya wa entertaining on idol . but he just entered his 16th minute of fame or rather infamy . this song is terrible ! off-key warbling , non-melodic , soulless . pas this up asap !
0	think i deserve my money back . this song wa labeled a clean , yet upon playing the entire song , there are several profane word . wasted my money because i can not listen to it .
0	wow geez one good song on this . it is a good song , the best song , but just that one song .

0	great music . the comment here and on npr helped lead me to this great disk . it wa very difficult to play my copy . like most people , i have more then one device to play a cd in . this cd doe not work in most of them .
1	at the age of 66 and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much . i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her . this wa one of those song . in all there wa 11 song that i picked out . i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it wa more then worth it . after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level . so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that express your love for her .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	this is an absolute classic . it brings me back to the day when michael wa but a wee child prodigy and that make sme happy
0	terrible use of auto-tune .
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap-rock band , in detail . i am not one of those people . for me , this genre is a side dish , not the main course , but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it . new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album , numb : the same anger , the same desperation , the same hard edge . but i think that frontmen tac and hash , while working from this genre , wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance . tac ha stated : . it is a snapshot of our generation right now . the way a lot of u feel in a time of war , technology , pain and love . it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today . i have felt this way , but i have not articulated it , even to myself . abicas lyric reflect this state of affair , and musically they draw on various influence . the main one i notice are linkin park , hollywood undead and of course , eminem . the lyric cover the whole range of problem - political , personal and social . the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album : if everything that mattered to me is now gone . now take a closer look and tell me what you see . track 2 , tell u why , continues with the directly political : we are underground . before you say goodbye , you have got to tell u why . thing get more personal in turn me on , which seems to be about people questioning one route to self-satisfaction . in my song and the thing you think i say , the anguish is over failed relationship . the pursuit ha the line just let me in . if i get the chance to play , i think you will want me to stay . beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time : you are beautiful , so { censored } beautiful . i would be a little more complete if i just had you . just another , never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense , demanding and hypocritical . a for musical influence , there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable . three of the track open with melodic , solemn piano , which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious . i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of , say , nine-inch nail . gave em a reason open with dance music element , then includes some excellent guitar work , both grungy and psychedelic - a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic , spiritual , up , and grunge is depressing , scary , down . several track have a synth-string background that give them a more mainstream sound . just another includes military-style drumming and army-march lingo . release from numbness come in the final track what you see , with an ironic twist . they sing , open up your eye . nothing more to hide . now the time ha come/and all this go away , and i am not { censored } numb . look around , nothing ever heals the pain . the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them . it could almost be an 80 pop-rock track , and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting . hmmmm . the album is full of explicit language ( which i had to censor in this review ) , so if you are one of those people who can not take that , by all mean stay away . but if you are ok with free expression , you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while .
0	just not the same a bon jovi
1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early 70 . other hit song by them were hey , nineteen , rikki do not lose that number , deacon blue and do it again .
0	i downloaded it thinking that i could use it and hear it . it wa lost in my harddrive somewhere and now i just wasted a $ 1.00
1	the song re-interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them . this might be a christmas album , but the music is not limited to only that time of year .
0	i guess i just expected a lot more from rob zombie . this album wasnt anything great . i hope the new movie will blow my sock off !
0	if i wa having myself a bowel movement at a b-bq joint in anytown , usa and this came on mid movement , i would committ hari kari . it is that terrible . this make shania twain sound like mozart .
1	my kid love this song ! it is so much fun to listen to and sing along with . bonus , i do not get tired of hearing it .
1	dark , but great song . and it easy to play on an acoustic guitar . liked it , good value for the price and convienient to download . i love amazon .
1	this song wa just a i remembered it from my teen year . i really enjoyed listening to it . more than once .
1	love it , fun dance song
1	great song . country at it best !
0	i did not like it because i wa looking for lp not single . anyways , i sent it back and i wa quickly processed for money return . it wa needing more information on the add .
0	it is interesting to hear ernst speak , however , not stating this is 45 second long is almost misrepresenting itself . in fact , it is . listen to the free clip - you have heard 70 % of the interview . shame on you , amazon !
1	this is so sweet . frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon , but listening carefully , and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night . frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis , blind boy fuller and john jackson . this guitar-as -piano style , in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note , is a rich sound , one at which frank is very much in control . from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change , frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint . the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite . highly recommended .
1	this is my favorite version of valerie : it ha personality , class , great performing style . oh , it is beautiful . i realy wish that it would be her signature song , not the i am not going to rehab , ( no , no , no , ) one .
1	rip
0	disappointed . nothing like their first track .
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album . i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them . so i will not spend the money to buy the entire album . when this song is available to download individually , let me know and you just might get a sale .
1	purchased for my 7-year-old niece mp3 player this past christmas . clear download , nice song , decent price , no problem completing transaction .
1	great
0	art garfunkel ? his version wa much better , more relaxed , and much smoother . i get the feeling this one wa a little out of mr. grobans range .
1	-incredible scream -great melodic breakdown -incredible emotion curious to see how the next album is . you can tell this band doe their own thing/has their own style and doe not conform . that is what make them great . con : album is a little too short , some of the song sound similar
1	i have never listened to a soundtrack , never in my life . never thought i would , for that matter . but , after watching tron : legacy , i wasnt the biggest fan of the movie , but i loved the music ! it is amazing , a this review title say . : ) i usually always have playing on my mp3 player thousand foot krutch and fm static , my favorite band . so i thought it wa kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff ( since tfk is hard rock ) , but i have already listened to the whole cd four time since i bought it this morning . i would definitely recommend this album . get the whole thing . it rule . and , btw , i am becoming a very big tron fan , thanks to this awesome cd ! and i watched the first tron , and i really really enjoyed that one . i think everyone need to watch that one if they have seen , or are going to see , the second one , because it really help to understand it all . thank you all you tron people !
1	love this song
1	well it is wreckx-n-effect . what more need to be said . mr teddy riley did it yet again . with this group made up of his brother & cousin he killed the 90
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer .
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you , but it is just an instrumental version of the song . it did not say this anywhere in the description or anything . i wish i had known before hand so i did not end up buying a song i did not want .
1	great song . love it .
0	ok
0	it is such a shame that a good song with a great beat ha to use lyric that can not used by those who follow christ . i wa hoping to teach this dance at a church line dance party , but can not , it would be nice if i could find just the music with out the lyric . if i would have heard the word of the song before i bought it , i would have not .
0	sick . trash deleting asap
1	great song better than season one that also deserve a full cd release like season 1
0	only got this for a friend .
1	nice
1	even switchfoots b-sides are amazing ! any fan would love this ep
1	excellent song !
0	my husband and i love jim gaffigan , so when i saw a cd that we did not yet own , i wa excited to surprise my husband with it . however , when i received it , there wa a parental advisory label on it that read that it had explicit language . i wa shocked ! nowhere on amazon description of this product doe it indicate this . i am shipping it back right away .
0	not good
0	just when i thought there wouldnt be another really bad trying to be punk band around the starting line came . they sound exactly like nfg . which is not good either . and there lyric are so boring and lame . if u like bad pop/punk and a annoying whiney i broke up with my girlfriend lyric and not to great of music then this is the cd for u
1	you can b. sure that this tune is still great ! get it now ! it will bring back old memory , and sound all new at the same time .
1	my 14 month old baby love this song . quality is great . i wanted exactly same sinsong , singed by same singer etc . and i think this is it !
0	a much a i really wanted this to work , it absolutely did not ! the voice is irritating rather than soothing . the guided image is amateur at best and the relaxation technique hurried and not effective . a cup of warm milk is cheaper and work better . considering all of the experience this guy ha , i expected so much better . do not buy it , it is a waste of your money .
1	there were a couple of top 40 song from this album , but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound .
1	this is a good beginner collection to classical music . it doe lack some key piece which is why i gave it four star ( no danse macabre , and vivaldi four season masterpiece are incomplete - just one part from each season ) . but overall i love it and i wa able to make back up disc for each artist . i highly recommend it !
0	great song !
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa ! a must buy for any march lover !
0	sorry @ the head and the heart but i just do not get it . i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money .
1	i love the song white christmas . michael and shania make a very good duet couple . very good christmas song for anyone .
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan , but i love this new song . it modern , clean , and just a great song . if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album , i think it going to be great .
0	sorry all you dude who will flip over this but using god name that way over and over is childish and ignorant ! like the uneducated idiot that can not make a sentence without a foul word in it . seriously guy it unintelligent !
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the higher power and find some way to let other people know that life can be more than a collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing . best of all , why should i be scared of you ? is dismissed by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more . dig it .
1	used this for my uncle funeral and the download did the job it wa used for . not much to say about a music mp3
0	come on the new me is now and i not living in the past . the word of god renews my spirit daily !
0	i want a new online music store , i want a new music store , one that do not just sell mp3s , one that will sell me original cd quality downloads , one that will take the time to respect the music , one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should . seriously bought one single just to test it out , cause i do not want to pay $ 40 , for the original cd ( reprint ) . i am not a audio snob , but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup . i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is 1/10 of the original data in mp3 format . i would gladly pay an extra $ 5 dollar or whatever for wav handling , i do not think this is too much to ask . amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this .
0	from [ . ] , dated august 17 , 2008 : the compilation album a closer end , that recently started appearing on the p2p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store , is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg . it is very convincingly made , with a century medium logo , fake barcode and extensive booklet , but it is nevertheless a bootleg . it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing , but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not , and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography , presented a a legitimate release , we feel the need to set the record straight .
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track , this one about the worst you could pick . i previewed some of her other track . not great . but definitely not a bad a this track . i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one . not good .
0	every now and then , great artist miss the target . queen had hot space van halen had vh iii this is on that scale of bad . it is sing songy long boring choral moment . it is melodramatic story telling . it is the greatest collection of technically gifted artist playing simple uninteresting part . do you remember asia ? yeah it is that bad .
0	these guy are terrible .
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost . basically , all of u just about .
0	i do not understand how this album won award . i would ask for my money back if i could .
1	it wa in florida when i first heard of the song see you again by miley cyrus back around 2007 on a local radio station . i wa driving in my car on the way to the grocery store and the carefree vibe of the song put me in a good mood ( iheartradio also feature this song on the miley cyrus radio station ) . anyhow from my perspective , see you again by miley cyrus appears to be about the singer being determined to go after the person that she feel very strong feeling for with the lyric im ready to aim . the music complement the song a well .
0	not worth the price : this digital download wa free !
1	what a great song !
1	forget ravel bolero . this is the most sensuous , evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone . it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace . share it with someone you love .
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly . after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post-2004 , they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence . unfortunately , this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea , resulting in track that i would never expect from this band . destroyer already start this off on an iffy note , with it rhythm section going for the big , loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena . bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing-along chorus . vice grip , the first single , also follows in this vein . then we have track like crushed , which first bite off heaven shall burn , then sound like they are attempting to be some 3rd rate rage against the machine knockoff . writing on the wall is a complete joke , with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you , complete with dubbed in violin . whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity , i actually like the track dedicated , a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound , and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well . it is not a complete loss of an album , but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound . i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist .
1	love them
1	a mellow , infectious , romantic love song , not only for the female specie , but most definitely for guy who are truly in love .
1	this is great and interesting music . this is music that is both creative a well a being entertaining . i look forward to listening to future music contribution .
0	ha anybody heard swishahouse choppin em up pt 1 ? mr. big pic sound like he is cry at the end of every line he spit . he is so emotional . it must be from the bottom of his heart
1	the star say it all , do not know what else i could put other than i love it .
0	too much talking
0	something my pocket purchased and played
0	love the band , but there only one good song on this release . seriously , anything that say feat . in it is passe and unoriginal . if you are so good , why do you need help ? it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together , and now everyone is doing it . seriously , keep the dj out . none of the good one know wtf they are doing . i will pas on this one . collide is much better , and 13 song at that .
0	not what i expected
0	i never ordered this . i hope it wa free .
1	billy curringtons album is great . it is one of the best album i have ever heard . billy is going to become one of the top artist in the next few year . every one should buy this album !
1	one of my favorite dylan album . a masterpiece !
1	this wa a pretty good album , i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs ( that still belongs to to the pain ) , but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band , i would like to see them do more solo though . pretty much the only song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor , my two personal favorite on the album were pin & needle and never cared before .
1	i love bronn journey harp music . thanks .
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley , which you do not know unless you are into the whole post-hardcore movement . apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic-sounding song , so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark . the song keep the lyric , maintaining the dirty feeling of it all , but it turn up the rock , and really make it a rockin song , causing it to end up a really weird , but fun combination for various party . check the song out , and you might find you like it if you are into post-hardcore , modern rock , or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat . who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ? oh , by the way , i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon . ; )
1	and lyric that remind me of the hauntingly wonderful lyric of belfast , bernie taupin sure can paint a picture wit word . can not wait for the album .
0	basically my sister ( 16 year old ) is listening to this garbage in the other room , and it is aggravating ; i do not like shopping at the mall , and this music is teleporting me there . it is the definition of insipid , and exactly what any big chain store need to keep it customer shopping happy , and thus spending dough . in other word , this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that want something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience . it is highly recommended that one doe not expose themselves to this music voluntarily though . to do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one world view in small , and the world at large . anyone who like this doe not like music , but i would not know , i do not like music either-i like mogwai-good boy from glasgow scotland that know how to rock . for if it dunnae rock ti piss
1	great ep
0	audio is terrible
0	nothing of great interest . mostly a vanity project . quite disappointing , really .
0	what a rip off of katy perry . wow ! how no one ha noticed is unbelievable !
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever . the movie is great , and so is the soundtrack . kevin spacey doe a great job all around !
1	i will always love 3 door down !
1	i love this song ! i also like this girl is on fire ! i love her ! i look forward to her next album !
1	that voice , this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe . love is grand , so appreciate it . because everything fade away .
0	this should be a lot better . however it is not . do not waste your money . sorry brian
1	love this song . nate is a great praise and worship singer .
1	tragically , it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world , the great natalie cole . but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie , is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart . something that many of her diva like rihanna , beyonc , britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all . instead , they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone . natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the 80 , that nearly derailed her career and her life . in the 90 , she made peace with the passing of her beloved father , nat king cole , and went into jazz music , after year of r & b . but she had some great song for everyone alone . a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end . she flexed her sweet , and beautiful voice in the movie track , with the same title name from 1997. it is a lovely song , and i think of this song from natalie , a one of her best in her lifetime . it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love . i miss natalie so much , but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice , with a deep heart . natalie cole : 1950-2015 song : b+
0	bought by mistake . not among kelly best ( check out ne-yos song of the same name ) .
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round . it is so soothing , yet intense at the same time . the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece . i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful , graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent .
1	this is a good song do not wa easy to download with no problem at all sure the album is good
0	love the song but this version is barely audible . hello , it is rock , where is the volume .
0	wrong purchase : /
0	i liked both of the single , undead and no . 5 , that came out a while back . i threw this cd into my order to get free shipping . based on the single , which were decent rap metal , i wa expecting a rap metal cd . but this cd actually ha 12 white boy gangsta rap track and 2 rap metal track . huge disappointment and totally not what i wa expecting . the cd also contains song dedicated to california and la , talk about cliche . i think it is fitting that the re-release of this cd is called desperate measure ( to make money . ) i have already given the cd away . i guess if you are a fan of eminem copycat or icp , this is the cd for you , but i do not need to listen to poseur white kid rap about bitch , drug , and double-ds .
0	such a huge gigantic dissapointment from one of my musical idol , boring !
1	great music from a great series
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song . it really resonates with the pain i am current healing from . thank you , plumb .
0	i love the original video recording , but this version add way to much instrument background music . make it difficult to hear the word at many point in the song .
0	i downloaded this track by accident . this is the live version of the song . i wanted the original studio version .
1	one of conways sexy song .
1	phenomenal !
0	dumb
1	great album ! i am in love !
0	can not determine if music downloaded , can not find where it downloaded or to what file . will not download from amazon music again , due to the complexity of the whole issue
0	. the mp3 is of bad quality . be wary of downloading amazon southern gospel mp3s . i have downloaded about 8 or so and most of them skip like a bad lp or something . edit : my mp3 skipping problem wa traced back to my dial-up connection . be sure to download amazon mp3s via broadband for best music quality .
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful , full baritone , and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful , timeless song , but i found myself surprisingly disappointed . he is done something to change his technique , and he often sound nasally , especially when he sings word with the e vowel . i think he is been ill-advised in this latest singing technique , and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method !
1	this is a wonderful song that epitomizes the sound of country music between about 1988 and 1995. really take me back to that time , really good song .
1	this wa a well received gift . can not go wrong with john lennon anything .
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance . doe not mesh well with the other instrument . need a lot of work .
0	this is not the original version .
0	the whole mp3 is just noise , not good noise , not even a lot of noise but noise . what a bunch of hooey . do not click on this one . the only reason i wa looking wa i tried steve g. jones and in two night have already noticed myself being more aware of my motivation and feeling more determined to make wise choice when eating . it is also an extremely peaceful way to fall asleep . but this one - boo hiss stay away . glad i only wasted $ .99 . whew .
0	this skip too many line . she read line 1-7 then skip 8-12. read 13-30 , then skip 31-38. read 39-42 skip again 43-66 ! at first i did not know what wa going on . disappointed and not worth the money .
1	louie prima and keely smith , the king and queen of the 50 vega lounge circuit . included in this recording is the seldom-heard verse in just one of those thing .
1	yeah buffett .
1	beautiful song
0	mostly instrumental .
1	i like this song there is not a lot i can say other than i like it and so do my friend
1	stylistically , i love all type of music . but , how do i classify fireflights album , for those who wait album - is it indie , is it rock - i do not know ? but , what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work ! drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band - with fireflight , there are time i am visually reminded of the missing person - and , the driving vocal of pat benatar , and pop musicality of the go-gos mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs . ( thanks , pooh for the great word , smackerl , you silly ole bear ) . yet , although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular-bands-of-yore-oh-so-great in fireflights unique sound - i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh - and dare i say anointed ? check out the band website - [ . ] . they have their video available for your viewing pleasure . there is a genuine story being told in each song - i assure you .
1	jojos voice is truly gifted ! she ha comeback with great force and can not wait for further music from her in the future ! this tringle is great !
1	fantastic voice that jive well with the retro sound . like a dark , smokey pink martini . i do not have five more word .
1	wonderful old song - not covered enough at all .
0	there wa no cd inside only a perfectly wrapped case ! i am livid !
1	i lost this song from my mp3 album . i noticed it wa missing and this wa not acceptable to me . this wa my first downloaded song from amazon a few year ago .
1	a damn awesome song .
1	this is one of the greatest tune of the year , if not - ever . however , i ordered this cd thinking it had the clean mix on it , but it dosent , so now i get to buy another copy of this cd .
1	thank you
1	heard the song on the radio the other day had to download the song . brought back memory when i wa younger .
0	total ripoff ! this is not the whole song , it is like a 30 second sound bite from the song . i would request a refund except it is not worth my time for $ 1.29 . save yourself a buck and do not buy this .
0	package wa sent back originally because it wa too damaged . i had to re-order the product and when i received it the case wa severely damaged any ] way .
0	ok
0	i came of age during the 1960s and 70 . to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time , and it ha a certain sound - robust , edgy , energetic , and raw . i agree 100 % with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original , when the clothes were not costume , and this wa not a period piece . the 2009 version feel like a group of juillard-educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust . if you like this edition , at least also treat yourself to the original .
0	imo , this sound like something i couldve done with a toy saxophone . awful . listen to the preview . if you can get passed the sample and think it sound great , then go for it .
1	love bfs ! and they certainly have shown how awesome they truly are . again ! the bitch song ha always been a favorite of mine . and i am so excited to see it back on the track list ! it is great hearing that song . new and musically improved ! : ) stacys mom just make me laugh . because for some weird reason people have thought that they have been singing it for year . and now all of those people are correct haha . and i have never done anything like this is just typical bfs stuff ! love it ! good good stuff ! : )
0	i wa under the impression it had amazing grace with a pan flutist that i wa looking for . i wa very disappointed that it wa not !
1	love it .
0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd . what a waste of money . could these song be sung any slower ? very disapointed . l
1	beautifully written and sung . a song to listen to over and over . sound quality is good especially with headphone , oh yeahhhh .
1	uplifting & encouraging !
1	always smooth .
1	sound like old school veruca salt . recommended .
0	the worst try-hard band i have ever heard - how did these turd get an album out ? oh yeah - rich parent . ugh , lovely . it suck , do not waste your money .
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time music . that is what i consider this . along with the postal service , music to fall asleep to .
0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i.e . passenger . it is not and wasnt worth keeping . i tossed it in the trash . what a waste of $
0	i would love to give this a great review ( because i have been purchasing mp3 downloads for year from amazon ) . but after all my searching , my hard drive show no sign of this song . wish i could say more . i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager . still no luck . so . until i get to hear it and enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase . i will have to hold off on any positive review .
1	for country music fan such a myself who have spent many hour searching for hard to find recording of the music of schuyler , knobloch and overstreet , judy rodman , and schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt , this cd is a must for your collection . this cd cover most of the major hit of these artist that are almost impossible to find on cd . judy rodman , who wa a minor success ( and mtm record only artist before folding ) in the early to mid 80 ha several of her best known hit on this release . from the up tempo girl ride horse too to the memory laced until i met you , these two song are just a few of the hard to find gem on any cd of any type . i wa absolutely estatic to find the schuyler , knobloch and overstreet song you can not stop love in this collection . this is a song that i have searched for on cd for 3 year . this cd also ha rarity from the girl next door ( slow boat to china ) , schuyler , knobloch and bickhardt ( baby got a new baby ) , and two becky hobbs selection ( jones on the jukebox , they always look better when they are leavin ) . if you are searching for these obscure recording on cd , this offering will not disappoint you .
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song , it is a little different but it is okay
0	the drifter are typical of many group of the era , with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member . lot of lawsuit usually resulted . the nostalgic listener , expecting an authentic trip down memory lane , is the loser . if you are looking for the real thing , you have to go to the source : atlantic record ( < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/only-in-america-atlantic-soul-classics/dp/b00260phvo/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > only in america : atlantic soul classic < /a > ) . this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song , a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e. king , don covay , sam & dave and otis redding . it aint cheap , but the real thing seldom is .
1	stevie is hot , young or older
0	really misleading . it is more of a 10 minute show than a full length one . lot of behind the scene talk but that is about it .
0	it is ok
0	not too sure about this one !
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort . i find it boring . i find myself skipping most of the track and there are only 2 or 3 likable song out of 14. that is not what i wanted . i wanted 6-8 track that were very good not just 2-3. of course i did expect this album to sound different than the killer . but this difference is sound went the wrong way . everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it . i have listend to this album 6 or 7 time and still am not too thrilled . brandon you should recall this album and act a if it never happened . i hope the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed .
0	i saw anointed at toccoa fest , and immediately went and bought the album . i wa disappointed , only enjoyed a few song . the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping . do not waste your time and money
1	best cd i bought in a year . i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing .
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me . how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric ? better songwriting is definitely in order .
1	love the song it is so uplifting and i play it three or four time a day just to get moving !
1	grace is full of contradictions.in these troubled time it is no suprise . but she finally catch on that there is god who is flow of enduring love . the theme song deputy this in a haunting way .
0	not many good song . a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video . i did not like the rap in the middle , did not seem to fit the song .
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie , but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother . this audio encounter is not by the mayles , and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party . the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck . the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive . i do not know the timing of this production but big edie ( mum ) doe not seem to take part at all . the appeal of little edie had always been her expression , body language , and refreshing vocal ; this production did not stimulate at all , and wa frankly a little humdrum .
1	this is a good track from my teen year . it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood . i have not heard any of their other music , but this is a good track to get ; )
0	three year old order this by mistake while talking to alexa
1	great song
0	did not download a expected , emailed amazon , no answer !
0	way too much applause at the end .
1	great
1	love it .
1	great song ! band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is good a well ! recommend to people who like heavy metal , just not cookie monster metal !
1	get me pumped for the gym
1	bought this before going to see the show . well done . the show wa awesome ! looking forward to reliving the show with this cd . came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise . the cd is new and work great too .
1	classic redman . glad to see him back
0	the song is great . but , this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine in the background throughout the song , making it impossible for me to listen to .
1	another big streisand winner album . great collaboration duo .
1	always have been a journey fan
0	very highly sought after album . and - it is very well done . to bad it is a pirated cd . this album ha never been issued officially on cd and if you buy it , you are supporting pirated music . but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the pirated material it ha on it is site . and this one , it appears , is here to stay . after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale of these type of item .
1	cool !
1	keeping it real .
0	this is not the full song , it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration . i actually want my money back . do not buy !
0	it ok but not iggys best
0	it a live version and the song doe not start until around a minute in . not good to work out to .
1	prince wa ahead of his time on this one . my grandchild like it and the older one understand it too .
0	one song for $ 9.99 ? i guess it is my fault that i did not read the product description , but i wa under the impression , for that price , that i wa getting a full length cd .
0	if yo listen to the lyric , terrible ! nice , pop melody though which is probably why it is so popular .
0	i wa thinking it wa the whole song and it wa not .
1	this piece is so beautiful and part of the larger work of the great mass . this portion is so moving , i can listen to it over and over .
1	i purchased this song because it wa one of the song my father requested be played at his funeral . and rocio sings it with such heartfelt emotion .
1	this is a very good sounding mp3 download and you will be happy with the sound and quality of this download
1	great song , long length . thought provoking . brings back good memory from the 90 . you will ask yourself . where wa i when i heard that ?
0	i agree with eric , who reviewed this cd , like him i find this cd not too attractive . other than the hit song heard it all before , sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album . the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor , which could be labeled a light cuisine . a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good . i would not dare to compare her to kelly price , she might have a potential , but she is still got a long way to go to get there .
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel , the da song soon ! and narration by chuck smith . really , if you have shotgun angel , there is little reason to buy this . if you do not have shotgun angel , get it instead . if you are buying this for the song soon ! ( which is the weakest song on it ) get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead . if you are buying this for the narration , it is not worth it . i can not criticize the biblical passage , though not particularly well read ; but the interpretive part is not well done . i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement , but i knew this would be the case before buying the album ; i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile - and it would have , had i not already had all the song . the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision . i really felt like only giving this one star , but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for , were they not better found in their original context ( shotgun angel ) .
0	indie artist jonathan coulton took a clever new spin on the classic rap song baby got back . his version is amazing . if you buy his version through february , proceeds go to charity ! if you buy this version , you will be supporting glee , who used coultons version without any kind of permission or credit . no , thank you !
0	the asinine politics get in the way of the music . i listened to this cd at a neighborhood party and had to comment . i would not consider buying it even though ry cooder ha enormous musical talent and i have some of his other edition . hey ry , stick to music for everyone .
0	after a couple of day , song refused to play . had to download from another server .
1	omg i have two copy of this album . too bad it still not on cd but it my 3rd favorite cher album . star being my favorite . get your copy before it too late and it truly is more rare then it already is now . my favorite song are long distance love affair , ( the only single ) i would rather believe in you , and it is a cryin shame ! i believe this album is highly underrated and deserves more credit !
1	all right , beyonce .
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album - there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra , with mary martin doing the singing . that is the plus , a it is always a pleasure to hear her . why should not i is the third standard ( or maybe it is an almost standard ) from cole porter jubilee , and definitely a favorite song of mine . this is a very good straight version , without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it . the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse , which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric ( e.g . i must find some kind persona grata , to give me data , personally ) . for that reason , i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song .
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album , which i think is great ! this one did not deliver like that one for me but i am still listening to it . i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening . usually for me when an album doe not hit me right away , it will a little later , well see .
1	he is a young george straight . nothing outstanding on this album but just really relaxing and great for background music . i hope he ha a great career .
0	this wasnt what i thought it would be . a lot of the song i have never heard before .
1	this band is so good ! there last album wa good . this one is even better !
1	this is terry fator . what more can you ask for ? a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan .
0	no rocky top ? ! ? why bother ? that is like warm beer & cold pizza , close but not quite .
1	this young singer is beyond pavarotti or any other tenor , his voice is a example of perfection . his story make his music even more touching . i hope he get the attention of american . his voice is a banquet of healing to the heart .
0	cd case arrived cracked in many place . have yet to open the case because it is a gift , but hopefully it is ok .
0	i love ne-yo but this album wasnt what i expected
1	great song . i had no idea she wa rob shneiders daughter !
1	have 3 of their cd and love all three . love how they bring some old song back to new life god is great !
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world , i do not think that this wa the way to do it , she is obviously not a talented singer/songwriter , and should have found a better way to express herself . these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible . i actually feel sorry for her and quite honestly , feel a bit embarassed for her too : - (
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan . i own all of their previous album . therefore , i wa all excited for this album to come out , even though , i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait . i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better . they are not ! i would/will not waste any money on this album . it is a very big disappointment , especially judging it based on their previous work . they can and should be putting out better work than this .
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the 90 and 2000s . these song are a great mix of catchy tune , fun lyric , and biblical truth . furler and his co-writers have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together . the highlight of the album for me is it is alright ( for lazarus ) . i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man-cry . it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death . a few other highlight for me include shame , right wrong girl , and dare i say . truthfully , i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music . it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio .
1	the story wa good . the music wa so so . we hail from new jersey . and grew up listening to the four season . we used to follow them intensely . wherever they were appearing . we know their sound . the lead singer in jersey boy did frankie valli wrong . he wa singing to falsetto . you know over doing . this is our opinion , but then again we are jersey girl !
1	some of my favorite music from back in the 80 . brings back so many wonderful memory ! the cd arrived in perfect condition !
1	have yourself a merry little christmas sister hazel love this song . made christmas a wonderful time for all of u .
0	wow . a christmas album featuring a rhodes ! ? i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room , so i wa elated to see this cd . but it is not played on a rhodes . it sound like the electric piano patch on a cheap keyboard , complete with cheezy drum track . it is definitely not played on any model of a real rhodes piano . what a disappointment . all the song are very stiff , a if they were sequenced a note a time rather than played live . i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title .
1	the phoenix of the music world ha done it again . she is back and this album outshines believe . cher downplays the vocoder and us her powerful voice to send these song through the roof . song for the lonely will be huge - an inspirational song perfect for the world of today . alive again and different kind of love song make you feel like cruising down the highway in a convertible . when the money gone show that cher once again is not afraid to have fun with a brilliant comedic dance track . people - buy this album . let u put cher at number 1 again where she belongs !
1	classic
0	i am sorry , i hate to be rude or insensitive . people like what they like i know , however , i have to say that this is the worst song ever ! the fact that ne-yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe . the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard . i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous , horrible lyric and nasally singing . how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once . the first time is enough torture , seriously ! the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rotting good ! it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up . i like ne-yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired . this song suck badly ! i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h_ll this crap could be called music . many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it !
1	i love how they incorporated holiday bell into this soon-to-be christmas classic ! well done , p-unit !
0	not even enough here to rate ! it cut out and off before you can distinguish anything on it . do not like it .
1	i saw ruben win on american idol , love his singing .
1	best duo
1	i just like it .
1	i think that 50 cent newest cd get rich or die tryin is great . he is the hottest thing on the street right now . everyone is bumppin 50. get rich or die tryin got alot of cameo and it sound great it better than ja rule ! haha
1	great album wet dream , and hello are definitely stand out song for me . hate it or not it seems drake ha brought the ja-rule day back where mc were willing to sing their own hook and i think j. cole doe it well on the track he doe it .
1	love this song ! can picture the scene a it play out . a favorite every time i hear it ! thank you !
1	love it . ha a bluesy sound .
1	nice
0	i am giving one star because her husband joushua feuerstein telling people to give 5 star so this album can be on 10. you are husband should be in jail for stealing 30,000
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin , please note that i really wanted to like this album , and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii . for those who are die-hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you . i am not going to review each track , because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea . ever since untouchable , there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album , and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head , both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar . untouchable wa a good album , not great . mirror wa still decent , and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . however , a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album . i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue , and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . when you listen to their early work , the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue . with the release of untouchable , the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the 1950s . with each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus . this is not to say the album released since 2000 have been bad , they just are not worthy of a 5-star rating . this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two , but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio wave . doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? yes . doe he growl more ? sure . are the lyric memorable . no . doe the music stand out ? not really . i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material , but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge , and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . in 6 month , listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp3 player . they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great . i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression . either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . the album is not terrible , but it is unremarkable and candidly , it is also forgettable . my $ .02
0	quality of recording is not perfect ? * %
0	i downloaded it .
0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day . but let u face it , back in the day he wa in his twenty . keith is almost 50 year old now and still singing that teenage music . it is time for him to sing some grown up song . his title and lyric are so immature for his age . his voice still sound nice , but he need to grow the heck up ! to his credit , he look fine a hell on his new cd cover , very mature looking for someone so immature !
1	there is just something about brett eldredges tone . i just love to listen to him sing
1	good song
0	not to much into the hard rock sound .
0	ok cd . a few good song but not worth the buy . obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend , this will work
0	i really did not like the music . i expected it to be christmas themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have . the few instrumentals were pretty good , but the other selection were boring .
1	a nice smooth song with a meaning .
0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa . wasnt the seller fault .
0	the sad part about all this is that anyone searching for the original hit that inspired this knock-off collection might get one of these instead . even worse , they might mistake it for the original . collection like this need more one-star review to help steer nostalgia fan toward the song that will truly satisfy them .
1	this is one of my wife favorite tanya tucker song . i just had to get it for her .
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work , yet one of his best . a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook . it is unique , it is honest and it is meaningful . the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate , a bottle of wine and quiet evening . i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this .
0	i love him , not a much a he doe , but i have enjoyed all his music to this point . you can find song like this on any album in the genre , nothing wa added to the music world from this album .
1	what is there not to like with billy currington . i excercise to must of done something right . easy slow so start with stretching then upper body movement . i have arthritis . so this is great for me .
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music . most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it . i do .
0	actually , it did not . the first tune wa nice , but each one afterwards had a rather loud cricket sound in the background that wasnt restful at all . if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake , and i just found it too irritating .
0	love the song . hate the download process through amazon . i do not want your player amazon . you made the normal download link to small , like fine print . took me too long to figure out . made me grouchy .
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret , or even fire garden . but gospel and blue type singing ? . kind of a turn off . i do not think i will blindly buy another vai album . and that hurt to say .
0	would like it a lot more if it indeed had all 176 piece . mine only downloaded 100 .
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument . everybody think it wa korn , but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage . you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn , nickelback , and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the 1990s . almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana- monotone vocal that explode into raging scream , wall of distorted guitar noise , and whiney lyric about how miserable life is . do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll ? nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing . nirvana were not about music . they were about conformity and nothing more . just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable , immature , whiney suburban teenager from their money . they were the backstreet boy with guitar , basically . the linkin park of 88-94. i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade .
1	you can not help but tear up when listening to this song . it is an amazing song amd lea made it even better !
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard , but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic . very disappointed and would not recommend .
0	censored version , but it had the explicit label
1	with their sophmore album , lifehouse ha defenitely improved . their sound ha matured and become so much better ( not that no name face wa bad ) . the album first single , spin , is very energetic and uplifting ( and the video made me dizzy ) . a few other track to note are anchor , which is a powerful song , am i ever gon na find out , which is incredibly catchy , take me away , another very powerful one , and the beginning , which is beautiful enough to make me cry . lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall . i strongly recommend it .
1	love this song !

0	did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a 50th class reunion power point presentation .
1	always liked simon & garfunkel .
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label . the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin . the singer is brigitte fassbaender . warning regarding fassbaender . in da klangende lied , the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part . but in all the other piece in the two disc , the vocal are more prominent . it is therefore the case that in these other piece , the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most . fassbaenders singing style ( if you want to call it singing ) includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato . this bizarre , exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted , to be a perversion , and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition . when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording , it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed , irritated , and angry . in some kind of music , such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins , or in grindcore music , such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass , the distorted voice is the point of the recording , and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience . but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music . also , fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you . for this reason , i recommend only da klagende lied , but am not able to recommend the other piece on this 2-disc set . the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler , and they consist of da klagende lied , kindertotenlieder , de knaben wunderhorn , lied eines fahrenden gesellen ( all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ) , and ruckert leider ( all five song are here ) . only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation . this review provides a side-by-side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle . the rattle recording is slightly better , for reason disclosed below . this review also provides a side-by-side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn ( the song about the fish ) with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado . the abbado recording is slightly better , for the reason listed below . second-by-second account of waldmarchen . this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied , one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire . waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum . at the 6 second point , the french horn provide a short riff . then , at 18 second , the flute join in . the french horn resume at 23 second , and at 24 second , the reed and string join the fray . at 33 second , the french horn join in again , and here they play a real tune , not just a riff . at 50 second , the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch , and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch . at one minute and 37 second come a momentary crescendo . it is a big crescendo , but there is not any crash of cymbal . these timing are for the rattle recording . this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording , with the nit-picky exception that i list below . the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second , but the rattle recording start with music , not with any hum . comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle . the chailly timing is 28 minute and 8 second , while the rattle timing is 28 minute and 31 second . in the chailly recording , the tenor ( werner hollweg ) make his entrance at 5 min , 36 sec , singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire . mr. hollwegs voice is slightly tinny . in the rattle recording , the tenor ( robert tear ) make his entrance at 5 min , 23 second . robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding , somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff . thus , i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording . for reason unknown to me , the chailly recording ha a tenor ( werner hollweg ) and a bass ( andreas schmidt ) , while in contrast , the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone . the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea . the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann . there is no discernable difference to my ear , in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording . hochzeitsstuck . the chailly recording clock at 18:32 , while the rattle recording is 18:57. the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum , a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass , and blaring brass . this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off-stage band , which is much quieter than the on-stage orchestra . the off-stage band can be heard , for example , in the interval of 2:16 to 3:12. when the off-stage band is playing , the only other source of music is vocal soloist , at least for this interval of time . this movement also feature a chorus preference . for the following reason , i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied . the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume , and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic . in contrast , the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy . also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice , over the tinny voice of hollweg . the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff ( baritone ) and anne sofie von otter ( mezzosoprano ) , a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label . on the chailly recording , there are only three song , a i mentioned above , and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato . in the abbado recording , some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female . my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish , and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no . 2. anyway , this compare the fish song ( de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording . notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at 20-30 second and 60-65 second , and the five second donkey-like braying from clarinet that occurs at 60 second and again at 105 second . the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong . i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason . first of all , the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo . also , in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured , because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute , and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato . the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording . also , the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon , and to my ear , the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording . to reiterate these point , what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound , and the more easily discernable fluttery flute , donkey braying , and mysterious chinese gong . conclusion . the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony . a careful side-by-side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording . i did my own side-by-side comparison , and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado . da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition , and it ha been my favorite since the year 1972. it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old .
0	meh , not my type i guess .
1	average white band wa and is music to iisten to . 1970 music can be slow or fast depends on what you like to listen to .
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa ! maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again . i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year ! i feel ripped off and so disappointed !
1	love this song . start my day out with it .
0	i very rarely bother to write a review , unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something . unfortunately this is the latter . i have always considered tech n9ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak , materialistic , egotistical , club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about 8 year now . though every album ha had a different feel to it , i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound.this album is slowwwwwed down . tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music . not everything ha to be 300 mile per hour of awesomeness , but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either . the dj wa completely uninspired . i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist . usually a complex mixture of big brass , synthesizer , different time signature , other genre of music thrown in , and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around , this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music . the lyric are amazing a usual , you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album ( the only reason i am giving this a 2 instead of a 1 ) dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd.most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good , then slows down horrifically for the last two parts.there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album.the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n9ne cd . sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system . not the reason i buy tech n9ne . if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays . like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time . he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo . i am sure it will sell well . i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n9ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again .
1	beautiful song !
0	for the elevator or dentist office . i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here . but i wa a big fan . and yes , i gave the cd several try , all the way through . even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album . it is just milk toast . dull , uninspired and uninspiring . sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm ( really ? ) and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out , and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off . yes , mumfords voice is gorgeous , but not enough to save the album . hey , fame and fortune is tough , but they made it through 27. i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited .
1	this song is awesome . i am not a huge fan of three day grace , but this is by far my favorite .
0	the recording is not good . the voice and the instrument do not have a good balance . i wish i could get the studio recording instead of this live one . i think i made a mistake of choosing this version . his you tube music ha better recording than this one .
1	love this song !
0	i am so disappointed in the last 3 i bought b/c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song , rearranged or in a different language . this is very poor representation especially for a new group . whoever made those decision should be fired . their objective should b to make new follower , not loose them . i have purchased 15 dvd a present and 2 new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label .
0	i really did not find any of it funny , not a single redeeming quality to be found . usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at . not the case with this one , it is just devoid of charm or humor . it reminds me of a george carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea . i wish i could un-listen to it , do not waste your time .
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ! ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song ! keep up the good work
0	in my country if you make music this bad you get your private chopped off . thats all i have to say , no 50 cent , it is not my birthday , and we are not gon na party like it my birthday , especially not to your crappy music . have a nice day
0	definitely need to be remastered .
0	not such a great cd . only one selection meet my expectation .
1	love the work wish the cd had more track !
1	this is a great sounding set which is very relaxing to listen to . i recomend it highly although i do not recomend the second set 100 more piano masterpiece .
0	poor
1	i bought this for my daughter who just turned 6. she love it . we listened to it over and over during our recent 10-hour car trip . it brought me to tear to hear the old song that shaped my spirituality when i wa young , and i am so thrilled i can share it with my daughter .
1	. but not the people that sold it to me . it wa meant to be saved a an investment but when i got it it wa scratched in the front . very disappointed . : (
0	just do not like it , i took it just to check it out and i found out i do not like it .
0	i just received my cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd case , it is not new a advertised . the cd wa re-packaged with plastic , the inside piece that hold the cd in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery , the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it . i do not appreciate paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not the case . i will never buy anything from kristen overduff-abud again !
0	ok not what i expected
0	i accidentally bought it . i hate it . i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it . it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor .
1	louisville represent . love supporting artist from my home state . laid back soul . you got ta listen to this .
0	i have been a big boc fan since the 1970s , and have gotten most of their album along the way , but imaginos wa one that got away from me . i have seen many online comment about how great it is , and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction . so , when this reissue wa released , i had to pick it up . well . it really doe not do it for me , i am afraid . the problem is that , first of all , it doe not sound like a boc album , and , a i recently discovered , it is not . it is a solo album by bocs drummer , albert bouchard , and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera . despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger , the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another . the rather pointless re-do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with . and if you are going to call this a boc album , you have got ta have buck dharma , who get short shrift here . the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album , apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own . the album is not a total disaster ( i kind of like the baron frankenstein number ) , but i am very glad that i did not pay $ 100.00 for it on ebay ! i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja , and hope to see that happen sometime soon . ( p 07/27/08 : club ninja is coming soon ! )
0	when i bought this dvd i wa expecting to get the famous cali lifestyle 2 dvd . instead i got the audio cd with a small sample of creeper present cali lifestyle 2. the small sample dvd only contains about 4 minute of video footage from creeper cali lifestyle 2 dvd . if you want the full dvd contact cali finest production . you can also buy the full dvd just a long it doe not contain the audio cd . i wa very dissapointed with this purchase .
1	awesome value ! this is a great mix of classic christmas tune , instrumental and vocal , and is perfect for having on in the background of a christmas party . for $ .99 there is no better value .
1	beautiful !
0	wack
0	i absolutely love this song ! however , the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible . it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it . it did only cost $ .25 so i guess i will live with it .
0	it is odd when you buy music and the abulm contained nothing on it . it wa just some breathing noise and what i assumed to be someone penetrating themselves with a bad dragon sex toy . i replied to the seller but for some reason i received a legal notice saying that i wa being charged for hurt feeling . would not reccomend
1	attunement is a true miracle . a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid , spectacular sound . those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed . but in the lens of dembys all-encompassing camera obscura , attunement range from the raw , sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus . the texture are constantly changing , like the color and fragrance of a secret garden . you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before . such is the power of attunement . this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition ( spontaneous combustion ? . it doe smoke at time . the fire from the earth inner core ) a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure !
1	love elvis music
1	classic al stuff . in his usual humorous style . early in al album every song is great .
0	pearl jam is the band that basically told mtv to f- off after their first album - nirvana is the band that kept making music video until their demise how dare you call pearl jam sellout , pearl jam got huge because of their music & they made even le music video than nirvana nirvana is the most over rated , phony fake band ever - pearl jam is truly the greatest band ever , pearl jam stuck by their word , cobain never did fact : cobain used to call mtv & tell mtv to play nirvana music video more
1	i could not wait for bruno to drop his new album . i love his style . i grew up listening to different genre of music . my mom wa r & b . dad loved funk/soul and all true 80 baby should love new jack swing . he wa able to incorporate all of it on 1 album . hand down a masterpiece . whole album on repeat .
0	leonard cohens song have been part of the soundtrack for important part of my life , including a year in vietnam . i used to sing suzanne to my boy when he wa little . but . . .i really do not think ten new song is all that great . i am glad someone gave it to me , tho .
1	there is just something about him that take me away . he is got this voice that is so unique that talk to your soul .
0	i will not marry you , woman ! it is rude to keep asking .
1	it is pure pink .
1	like it
0	did not like this version of his . i thought i wa getting the studio version with the girl back-up singer . oh well .
0	please get it off my kindle i want it off my kindle i can not stress this enough those of u with ocd are freaking out with all the clutter we can not get rid of .
0	i came to this wanting to like it . i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever . i have all of rogers solo work , seen him a few time back in the 80 on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour . i am a fan . my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak . if life is really that bad , get a puppy ! i mean , i find it insulting that this multi-millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this - i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash . i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here ? i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig ( three different one ) and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death , another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak , i got rid of it . then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it . i never listen to it . this is music to depress yourself to . who need that ? if i want to be depressed i will watch the news . i do not need to hear it in my music . life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race . i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song .
1	i love her music , it is great to listen to . she is one of the great singer in the world right now . i love playing her song .
1	great voice ! this is a wonderful album to listen to . well worth the $ 5

1	an outstanding collection of song by a group out of vega , they are featured on the soundtrack for resident evil extinction track 15 contagious i have not heard a new band this good in year . hearing nothing but hanna montana and the jonas brother for so long i had given up on modern music , but these guy . these guy changed all that . thank you adam , ricky , kevin and matt for this bit of musical genius , i look forward to more of your stuff ! check them out on their myspace page [ . ] . add them and tell them alex from nc sent you !

1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier . watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music .
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite . his first three album are off the chart . but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop . what a bad album . ive waited this long for this . i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound . he need a producer , some one to make dope beat . this album is so mainstream so i hope all the people that buy the crap out there these day like it . im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more . at least the wu keep it real . built for cuban link 2 wa great . reggie come on what happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music ?
0	i purchased the mp3 but could not download it . i wa charged and when i contacted them they told me to try it again . it doe not work and all the thing they told me to do to fix it i had aldready told them i had done previous to contacting them . they were no help and i am out .99 ( big deal ) but still have no song .
0	i can not rate this ! it did not open for me . i am unable to open or hear this song . how can i make it open in mp3 form ? help
0	it sounded good on the clip . after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i thought i would be .
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and 2001 album - this is not it . i do not feel that this is a dr. dre album since he is not the predominant rapper , but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre . there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one . maybe he should have made detox all along . oh well .
1	this song is an awesome piece of musical poetry that talk of a lady accepting the loss of her relationship . it is not cry , but mere acceptance of the inevitable . toni braxton sound beautiful in it .
0	awesome music but the pressing on the vinyl [ lp ] is pretty bad ! my copy ha pitting on a couple song so the needle jump . the fun side of buying vinyl i guess . then when i go online to download with the given code i am told that it not valid a the code ha already been redeemed . total fail !
0	must have been real drunk when i accidentally purchased this . would never listen to it ( and i tried ) .
1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube . loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep . had one of the best sleep in a long time . maybe it wa a one off , but this wa encouraging . time will tell .
0	7 second of what , the hunger game intro ? do not get this download . you will regret it . need i say more .
1	i bought the book with cassette year ago ; considering the book came out in 1993 , i wa so happy to find the music in cd format . because i know the story behind the music , i do not know if the music would stand alone . it is gorgeous , ha a variety of flavor to it . it sound like song from a musical . i would recommend getting both the book and the cd . the book is not a picture book , per se , but a story with illustration . the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone . storyline : a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident . the relative is an older aunt , an anthropologist , living in the outback . she share a story with her niece . so the story within the story is the creation of the earth : when the earth wa ready to be born [ ancient ancestor ] stretched and yawned . and began to roam the planet . a they did , they sang , and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence . when they were done , there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth , sun and moon and star to find out what she really is . the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody , and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia .
1	awesome !
1	great
0	not only is she a horrible singer . she support cop killer . she is trying to gain publicity by hiring a convicted felon who contributed to the death of a nyc police officer to be in her video . please do not support her !
0	i used holosync a few year back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening 1. i used this product for about two year , at least 5 day a week , and completed the full 1 hour session each time . i must be honest and say it did nothing for me whatsoever . i gave it my best shot , i thought if i kept at it , one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me . but no , nothing , nothing good happened , no overwhelm even , just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean .
1	like steampunk ? well , this is electro-swing - and about half of the electro-swing album i find , i would call steampunk themed music . caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro-swing album that i have found . i highly recomend it . be warned that it is mostly instrumental - though that is what i like about it ( it make it a bit more timeless ) . it is fantastic for driving , or background music at party . enjoy !
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here . been a slipknot fan since the beginning . all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree . but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion . it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal . most cd grow on ya a time go . but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe 20 second clip in a song or two . that is because these song are all over the place . they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start . the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them . i do not agree with those saying this is iowa 2.0. this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer . skip this chapter .
1	awesome song and it is a timeless classic . i dare you through this on at the gym for the beach body pump
1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my husband of 52 year . what more could i say except i am looking forward to summer .
1	more jimi hendrix awesomeness ! do i really need to say anything ? if your a jimi fan , buy it and listen !
1	i bought this cd when it it first came out and still listen to it every week . deftones is one of my favorite band .
1	you have to consider , though , that music of this kind sort of play itself , and a far a i am concerned , the organist must just not get in the way of it . walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue , which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard , and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned . towards the end , i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed , still keeping within a modest forte . because there are no extreme of dynamic , i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car , where extreme softs and louds are problematic . ( modern equipment can do compression , which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car , so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration . ) bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy , but it hold up beautifully . i recommend it , and the entire set .
0	what a lazy production from pink floyd a it is supposed last album . very disappointed .
0	the background is not a background ! you can listen the kid singing
0	despite this being a label album , it really just another flame album . v rose only get one track to herself , and it the forgettable threw it all away . ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference , the label ha stuck with their two artist . yes , a lot of various artist from reach record , cross movement , and beyond are brought in to add flavor , but it flame project without question . and it ok , but it not a good a flame usual stuff , which ha been declining a of late in my opinion . i am kinda disappointed , a the guest did not shine particularly bright either , so i will give it a 2 , maybe a 2.5 no knock on the message , thats great . but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall .
0	did not like the song at all . i remove it from my download . very disappointed in the way it is song and the music .
0	problem is not the music . but they apparently sent u a blank . four different cd player and not a one can read it . holding it up to a strong backlight i do not see track .
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument . undoubtedly , sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra , the london classical player , are a highlight of this recording . the music is played with precision , a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically . what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the 5th symphony , which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording . norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work - his interpretation of beethoven 2nd and 8th symphony are , in some way , his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle . i listened to the 5th yesterday , when i wa feeling very low , and it put me in a much better frame of mind . we all need music like this sometimes . i have needed it a lot lately . sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having . i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it . modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous , heavy and stodgy . a recording for people who like fresh , crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar , washed down with chilled chardonnay , and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat , stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table !
1	i love this song ! download wa smooth and simple . burn to disc wa fine . will download more music from amazon .
1	this song came out in the 90 and i remember having this cd at the time . this wa one of their big hit along with i want u. i love this song because the group came along with a new sound . they were in when grunge rock ruled , but along come savage garden , what a blessing . the song is excellent a great beeat with great lyric , i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic , 80 , an 90 . a great band for those of u who whated something besides those grunge band . kris l. cockayne
0	i would recommend finding a different version to download . i absolutely love this song , it ha good sound quality , but they cut off the entire last word/note ! it drive me crazy and really ruin the track .
0	great song , but the download version is only 128kbps . why is no higher quality version available ?
0	come on . it is christmas . really ? did she really have to make a vulgar song ? she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday ? it is the season of hope and joy , yet lady gaga is producing this . i have never had a problem with her other work . up until now that is . and to top it all off , amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion .
0	the song is fine , but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro , like we are interested in hearing them make a half-hearted attempt at being funny .
0	too much fuzz not enough fan .
1	love this song , reminiscent of grover washington jr. great style and warmth .
0	very old school , but wa looking for the song for a frend
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from very joyous to most somber . this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way , and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother . very inspirational !
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd . a a collector of original cast album of flop musical , i regretfully bought that cd . it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album . the insert came straight off of a computer printer , the first band wa silent ( the actual recording started on the second band ) leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement . hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range .
1	wonderful music , a always by josh groban .
1	her usual perfect music . love it .
1	terrific !
1	i love me some brad paisley .
0	unimpressive music .
1	a very simple and bit plain country album that anyone would enjoy .
0	this 1981 recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me , one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest , silliest , and corniest the label ha to offer in new york ( with the exception of the three song i already mentioned . ) this recording wa of course , an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune . the problem here , aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived , is that the three african song ( 1 , 2 , & 4 singed in african dialect and in french ) are totally uneventful , bland , uninspiring , linear , unvaried , monotonous and totally pointless ! . there is nothing happening ! . laba sosseh is often too busy chit-chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising , and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid-back tropical beach feel with a little electric-guitar and some trap-drums in the background which get on my nerve ! . the 1st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo ! . it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to , and encourages them to dance it even further ! . song . 2 feature a chorus a long , a annoying and a insipid a : in coc , in coc , in coc de ba saaah , de ba saaah , de ba saaah all the way through till the end ! . other than that , we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique , curacao , ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut ( whatever that mean ! ) and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach ! he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too ! . ( while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth , this is really a bad a it get . ) for song . 4 , i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality , but which still come out pretty well coming from him . the reason why i decided to review this recording ( now that it ha been available under mp3 downloads since the 5th of august 2008 ) is to tell you to download the great 3. maracaibo oriental , the nice 6. pelta ( written by miguel matamros ) and maybe song . 5 anichayi which aint gon na change your world , but which is decent enough not to be skipped ( or bought for just $ 0.89 on mp3 downloads . ) even though this label wa mainly run by african associate ( a pianist alfredo valds jr. explained on his fascinating interview : the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section [ . ] ) i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly , or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality ! i would say each to their own thing ! . therefore , the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competences/knowledge to do it ! i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be ! finally , there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in 1982 , and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one ! there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental , overall the album doe show better with a big hit : diamoul maw , 2 rock-solid cuban tune which also happen to be song . 3 and 6 , and apparently another hit being song . 5 aminata . i would not dare risking recommend it to you all , but check it out anyway & nbsp ; < a data-hook=product-link-linked class=a-link-normal href=/laba-sosseh/dp/b001esgx6w/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt ? ie=utf8 > laba sosseh < /a > . song . 3 maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno-descrga tune ! it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr. that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end ! . there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate , outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago , amazing 2-trumpets/1-trombone horn arrangement , a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement ! . everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here ! . [ * descrga in latin music term mean jam-session . ] song . 6 pelta ( most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros ) is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk . otherwise , the tune is very pleasant , fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement , a tres-guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end . the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta ! [ meaning jerk in spanish slang ] . basically , a simple and great tune ! . for song . 5 ( which is a decent enough son-montno tune ) , i will let you lot take the punt . sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine , but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago , and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those 2 song ! . my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long , lacked melody and were unexciting too .
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the 70 , but i bought some other modern song rendition -what a shame . amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music . who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd ?
1	fantastic
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased . i will find something better . not worth it .
0	not my kind of music , downloaded them for a funeral
1	heard this song on the radio a few time and loved it . when i finally found out the name , i bought . it is cute and catchy , preview it and see ( hear ) for yourself = )
0	this is a very good song really pit me mind of new york : big sophisticated city image .
1	fun song , love it
1	great inspirational music .
0	i have all joshs awesome music and i purchased this cd without even listening to it first based on his other cd . wish i would have listened to it first . not what i expected the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me . there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to . maybe some of the song will grow on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to grow on me . it just blew me away right from the start . oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better .
0	i downloaded this song because it wa free and have regretted it . . . but free is free so you get what you get
1	i love his music and message
0	here is how i feel about regina spektor : when i first heard her 4 or 5 year ago , i thought , wow ! she is really unique and awesome ! . then came her next record and i thought . hmmm sound pretty much like the one before it . she ha managed to continue this cycle for 5 straight record . i think that is a record or something ( pun intended ) . i just want to tell her , yea , we have got it , you like kick drum and rubato piano playing and repeating 1 word a million time for effect .
0	like the other review of this gift , the question is why . why wa this even recorded and released , that is just for starter .
1	loving the new sound the boy are bringing to this new album so far ! can not wait to hear the rest of their album . the boy are awesome and so talented !
1	flagpole sitta is one of those song you either like when you hear it or you do not . either way , like it or not , once you hear it , it is stuck in your head . i am one of those who like it , hence , that is why i downloaded it . it may not be the greatest song ever done , but it ha a solid construction which is what make a song tick .
0	you can tell this is not an original , buy the dubbing and sound quality . i have and original jim stafford album from the 70 and this is not the same ouality of sound . suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england ,
1	i got interested in al a cart when i come across them on youtube . beautiful lady with beautiful voice make for beautiful sound . plus i love the disco beat . little known now and little info about them anymore . they were popular in europe in the early 80 . i think they were english but played a lot in germany . do not think they did much in the u .
0	i do not think anyone over the age of 16 like ( or can relate to ) nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed ( playing gig in a band doe not count ) . once you become become of that age , the most important thing are to aquire a decent-paying job and graduating high school . clearly , the people here are the pre-teen target audience . look at the misspelling , look at the abbreviation of even simple word , and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves . they would do anything for kurdt and are easily-lead . just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it . if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day , would you enjoy that ? same concept with these song . people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment . just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it .
1	i love this song ! nick voice is so hot ! it is always my ringtone around valentine day ! i do wish him and jess were still together but i still love it !
0	nancy sinatra spent over 30k to resurrect this wretched dreck from her vault ! she should have saved her money for a vocal coach and a decent plastic surgeon .
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive , it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office . one minute you are straining to hear the word , the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down . susan boyle voice is low , almost a mumble , and she sound like a little girl- not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection . i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it .
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song . if this is a good a his song writing get , he need to set down the pen . god help u if the album is a poorly written a this single . i can not help but think of fergie when i hear this song . it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed pea my hump . except , in this situation , there is a man singing it . it make my stomach churn a i think about it . are there no good male songwriter left in this country !
1	good song .
1	very good centering music to maintain balance .
1	love it , great song .
0	i love this song , but the amazon music app will not play it or save it to my phone .
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic . unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up . i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl , but the seller did list this a good condition yet 90 % of it wa unplayable . very disappointed .
0	terrible music even for an indie band plus the drummer leslie rasmussen blame a rape victim
1	always a classic song . great quality , too .
0	not impressed
1	this is our song for my boyfriend and me . mean a lot !
1	wonderful song ! great lyric and a really catchy tune . you will be singing this one even when it is not playing : ) let love explode and bring the dead to life a love so bold to see a revolution somehow now i am lost in your freedom and this world i will overcome my god not dead he is surely alive he is living on the inside roaring like a lion !
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer . the beat are pretty nice . if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat , that have a very raw/rough feel and sound . the right mix/dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal , etc on top . if , however , someone is looking for larger selection of beat , some with music , they could check out heat beat vol 1 by royalty free , then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league , or something like that . hope this help
0	i have trouble keeping this cd on . the singing is dreadful . her voice is horrible . it sound like she is calling the devil . my kid leave when it is on . i can not recommend this cd , it is just not good .
0	low sound quality . i deleted .
1	zac and the band are awesome
1	great album - can not wait to hear more from this group !
0	i heard the english version of veni sante spiritus on the divine office ap . i loved it and wante dto hear when i wanted . it wa adverized a being sold on amazon . i decided to buy it . so i clicked the link and purchased it from amazon . but it wa not the same version ! only one verse wa in english . i felt extremely disappointed ! i wanted the english version so very much . but i have no idea how to get amazon to either refund my money and/or get them to give me what i wa led to believe i wa buying : the english version of veni sante spiritus ! do not be fooled !
0	could not get it to go to my music app on my phone just to amazon music app

1	i wa happy to see that this track wa offered for sale , a it did not come on my original man of la mancha cd . i feel that , with the exception of the el hombre de la mancha madrid recording , this is the best recording of the show out there .
0	rip teleka . this man took your life . i am sorry that people think he some kind of god . but your god will bring you justice someday !
1	awesome cd . listen all the way through .
1	i friend recommended this music to me and i fell in love . i love the honest , open worship . if you enjoy bethel type worship , then you will love worshipmob . i can not wait for another cd by them .
1	fabulous music , love the violin and the piano in the background . the music is beautiful and after a long work day it relaxes me . one of the best cd ever !
1	this is by far the best cd mj ha produced
0	another recording by orginal artist but at a later date without orginal arrangement . always disappointing . be forewarned . it wa revealed in very small print .
1	beautiful and worth every penny the whole way through .
0	would not download . error in file name .
1	a good , clear copy of the song that closed out the breaking bad series . to hear it would always take me back to the early 70 . now , it reminds me of that tv series .
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file . i only wanted it to load to my other amazon music file/windows medium of my pc . now i can not load the song onto my android phone . i tried over and over again . the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer . will someone call or email me and straighten this out .

0	very disappointed in this cd . it is poorly recorded and is scratchy through many song , too annoying to listen too .
0	yuck
1	when the name van mccoy come up , if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late 1970s , it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle . mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to # 1 on the billboard hot 100 in 1975 , and wa billboard # 22 most popular song of that year . fast forward a year to 1976 , where mccoy released another song with a similar , albeit lighter sound , called the shuffle . though the track sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial ( and maybe it got used that way at some point ) , it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music . i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song , but i do not have any knowledge of how the step go . if you do , perhaps you will clue u in !
1	it is great ! i love it
0	ordered item and it arrived without any of the descriptive literature and information . wa not like the picture . returned 1st one and ordered a second which wa identical to the first . also wa returned .
0	when wilson first broke into country music , her hit such a redneck woman , homewrecker and here for the party were cutting , fresh and brash . now her latest single , do not do me no good is just uninspired- it sound like the 101th song out there on country radio . an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty that is a clumsy a the title is . wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re-invent herself . she should just take her advice when she sings on this track , yeah i know it aint right/to sit around all night and let your memory/get the best of me .
1	i like listening to demi lavatos music . she is pretty good . i bought it for my kindle fire hd . you should like it too .
0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd . i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand . with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere . i really do not know how to describe how i feel . it is not bad music , it is not a bad album . but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band - i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it . i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford & son - other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have . i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke , this is not going to be one of them . it is the kind of music you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because - dare i say - it is kind of boring and yawn inducing . i am not going to purchase new - i will wait for used and cheaper . not that i think amazon is asking too much - i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar . sorry mumford & son , the album is ok but not what we really liked you for .
1	love it
0	the version of the song is not my favorite . unfortunately , i think this is the only version released . i even tried to find the song on the soundtrack of the national lampoon vacation movie but wasnt able .
0	music wa too high i could not use the soundtrack . i tried with my soprano and they could not sing to the soundtrack .
0	i think it is time for tony bennett to cut these duet album . though i do not prefer spanish singing , some song are nicely done . but my main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous 2 duet album . with all the great classic song to pick , why recycle the same song ? i do not get it .
1	listening to him is so relaxing
1	this is a great song with a great message . yolanda adam is one of the best gospel/inspirational singer ever . king kong aint got nothing one her ! ( lol )
0	i went through day of singing this over and over .
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co-writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception . however , unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album , this song is not very magical . in fact , it fall flat on the floor . the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time . the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to . sorry , lenny . maybe next time ! 2 star . end note : at least he still look good though . i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt , and le clich and boring . this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic .
1	come on it is led zeppelin : d
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation . check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion .
0	i paid for this song so i could attach it to some picture of my daughter . it would not play the whole thing . i definitely felt ripped off
0	i am not a music critic , i can not tell you if it wa over produced nor can i tell you what they were going for . i can simply say i did not enjoy the album . one , maybe 2 good song but nothing that i feel the need to immediately add to my play list . i hope they , zac brown band , plan to get back to country again soon . still listening to all of their other album daily .
1	perfect . a described . thank you
1	this song really won me over when i would watch the early full metal alchemist episode . then i decided to watch some more youtube video of her song . i wa sold . that wa when i decided to purchase this song . she reminds me of a japanese shakira . the donde estan los ladrones shakira : soulful , gritty , heart-thread tugging , soul speaking singer .
0	i think it is so good message is great i just love it.i think my finger touched one star and this page came up but this get all the star .
0	i am from mxico . i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality , too much surface noise and not very good sound . i decided not to get the next one . but when my favorite maiden album ( this one and 7th son ) came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity . i have to say it wa the same disappointment . they do not even sound nearly a my 80 uk edition . whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection . i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl . too much surface noise and tick and pop . please , if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl .
1	love this vinyl
0	purchased this and it never did show up in my account .
1	i thought their first album wa amazing and this may even be better . the lyric , vocal , instrumentals are all in sync and only get more interesting each time i listen .
0	to small
1	a
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want . amazon . a little warning next time please . i still cant find the song i did order . anybody can help with this ? im going in circle here . secondly , the song wa annoying at first hear but it a positive message and kindda poppy . cross between old beatles music and alternative rock . least it not filled with suicide , violence and cursing . i will be looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo , not a bad idea . agaion , amazon , a little warning next time before you just dump something on them . you need to make your uploading process easier . this is getting to be too much work for too little . i may stick to itunes
0	pleasant professional voice - would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician - not so much . so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd . forgettable .
1	road trip music
0	i love bob dylan and so i bought a christmas cd thinking it would be in his unique style . i wa very disappointed . his sound doe not work with these song . it is not enjoyable . the backup singer are bright and sound young and angelic , which contrast nicely with bob throaty sound , but the choice of song wa wrong . sorry bob !
0	crazy music
0	i like the cd or better said , prince music . my problem is the packaging is crap . i broke the cd in half just trying to get it out . the cd snapped like a potato chip . seriously . product quality mean everything , not just the music .
