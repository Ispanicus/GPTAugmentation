0	for the lift or tooth doctor office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i english hawthorn justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a ring i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly elementary drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to crook it off yes mumfords vocalization is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	very old schoolhouse school but wa looking for the song for a frend
0	it is quite funny how the lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to post they decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately transition in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an note with it rhythm section going for big loud and sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting be some rd rate rage against machine knockoff on the wall is a complete joke with mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	i screw that some mass can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those mass for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i take heed it new band abica villein up a good slice of it on this album blunt the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i retrieve that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more cosmopolitan appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and blunt to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this land of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of a function of problem political personal and social the entitle racecourse present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you visit racecourse tell u why continues with the directly political we are tube before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about mass questioning one route to ego satisfaction in my song and the thing you retrieve i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the communication channel just let me in if i get the chance to play i retrieve you will want me to persist beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a piffling more complete if i just had you just some other neer that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficultness of living a life of your choosing in a bon ton that is strain require and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the racecourse open with melodic solemn pianissimo which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other racecourse have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both dingy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is enraptured spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several racecourse have a synth string background that open them a more mainstream sound just some other includes military style drumming and army march lingo unloosen from numbness come in the final racecourse what you visit with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored blunt look around nothing ever heals the pain the satire lie in the fact that the music for this racecourse is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pappa rock racecourse and banker acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those mass who can not take that by all mean persist away but if you are ok with free expression you will take heed an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	this product take the form of two compact disc indorsement on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the let singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the carcase lie vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two noteworthy disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre diamond state exaggerated non vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion revue and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha put down a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins lie or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is angstrom not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied sung dynasty but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende speech sound lied kindertotenlieder de holler knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here cram and characteristic ruckert leider all five song are here angstrom only three of the thirteen of the song angstrom of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides gustav mahler a side by side comparison of de knaben aside wunderhorn with the same recording under the salient baton of simon outspoken rattle the rattle recording is slightly better put down for reason disclosed below this review also provides indorsement a side by cite side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio dwell abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides saratoga chip a description of lie the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at dwell second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at lie second the reed and string bust join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of in that respect da klagende time interval lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the flute glass chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody piece of music in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording call for the piece of music tenor robert aside tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle not bad recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the honest tenor is robert tear and the baritone is phonation sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute euphony is distinguished by angstrom solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of bit an off stage band which is much quieter than more or le the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume angstrom and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in saratoga chip pillowcase contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a piece of music conducted by make up abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of glucinium sung dynasty the song aside are sung by the male full while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn bout is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a hera that found in aside the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua diamond state fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second rattling donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a about low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly along recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato indium the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable let fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for along recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most earnest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came bet on after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the that nearly jump her career and her life in the she made peace with the transient of her beloved begetter nat big businessman cole and went into jazz music after year of gas constant b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie give chase with the same title key from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply damned she had a sincere voice with a oceanic abyss heart natalie cole song b

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most charles frederick worth interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of angstrom the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording superfluous norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony symphony orchestra are menstruation in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very make up low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to symphony orchestra the symphony of these diddle composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that euphony they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra listen make this music sound so new ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed evergreen state with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed real down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	roll in the hay it
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it can not criticize the biblical though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case the album i expected artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n bear witness ne to be one of last great bastion now of hip hop music in this bleak indium materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had clear a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album angstrom is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller witness all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre leftover of cut through music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest corrode sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of screw up the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from vary previous tech n ne cd and then sound angstrom like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip desolate hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop plod artist he ha changed his tune angstrom to keep up with current creative thinking time he now ha produced an accessible album for make up the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will defeated definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	this is terry fator what more can you postulate for a must have for the real die hard terry fator fan
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to set off off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy alloy influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band undoer already set off this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section depart for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drumfish fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first unity also follows in this nervure then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst turn on vocal over a drumfish pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduce averageness i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of averageness from a band attempting to ramify out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	best cd i bought in a year i play it constantly when i do art and it is so soothing
1	this product take the make of two compact disc on the decca recording label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender cautionary regarding fassbaender in da klangende rest the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the casing that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to claim it singing include a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato movement fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice hour angle a prominent theatrical role in any recording it damage the recording and hour angle the likely to movement the auditor to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of euphony such a i put a tour on you a recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a disinter to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice heighten the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender go wrong to realize that gustav mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony a well fassbaender go wrong to realize that gustav mahler euphony is not some type of novelty song dynasty a is the casing with i put a tour on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende rest but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composing on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende rest kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn rest eines fahrenden gesellen all four song dynasty of song dynasty of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song dynasty are here only three of the thirteen of the song dynasty of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparability of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly best for reason disclosed below this review a well provides a side by side comparability of one of the song dynasty from da knaben wunderhorn the song dynasty about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly best for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the chess opening mo of da klagende rest one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle beat at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute glass join in the french horn re start at second and at second the reed and train join the disturbance at second the french horn join in again and here they shimmer a real tune not just a riff at second the tonal pattern provided by the entire orchestra go down to a lower pitch and the antecedently award motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one arcminute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these time are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende rest are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit finicky elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start up with euphony not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly time is arcminute and second while the rattle time is arcminute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful tonal pattern in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is reasonably creamy sounding reasonably like that of thomas quasthoff thusly i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle recording hour angle a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende rest is der speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my ear in the chess opening arcminute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the chess opening arcminute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle beat a secure bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and toot brass this rd movement of da klagende rest is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other reservoir of euphony is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement a well feature a chorus preference for the accompany reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende rest the rattle recording evergreen state recorded at a higher bulk and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy a well i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the accompany compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly recording there are only three song dynasty a i bring up above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a recording label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song dynasty are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the song dynasty from da knaben wunderhorn is the song dynasty about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same tonal pattern a that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song dynasty de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that come at second and again at second the piece concludes with a gloomy bulk mysterious sounding taiwanese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song dynasty hour angle too much echo a well in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording a well the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent gloomy note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the nappy sound and the more well discernable fluttery flute glass donkey braying and mysterious taiwanese gong stopping point the chailly recording provides a great selection of gustav mahler piece that are not enumerate symphony a careful side by side comparability of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any auditor to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparability and hear that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende rest is my very favorite of gustav mahler composing and it hour angle been my favorite since the year it evergreen state composed when gustav mahler evergreen state only year old
1	i know that some versatile people can discus at length the merit of hour angle various rapper and rap rock band in detail make up i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i in front can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now let the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to prepare all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated glucinium it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair make up and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me topsy turvydom is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self some other satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say benumbed the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha honest the line just let me in if i get the chance thread to disjoint play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i ira just had you just another never that far away and fashion nothing here are generally about hour angle the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should in expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an common industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason snap open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative more than pairing because assist psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and dry grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes implication military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha like a shot come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for make up this track pick up is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean last out stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been assist honest around for a while
0	when wilson first broke into country music her hit such a redneck woman homewrecker and here for the party were cutting fresh and brash now her latest single do not do me no good is just uninspired it sound like the th song out there on country radio an uptempo hookless radio tailored ditty is a clumsy a the title is wilson should ditched the gloss of commerciality and re invent herself she should just take her advice when she sings on this track yeah i know it right to sit around all night and let your memory get the best of me
0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try tabu all respective the effort way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself charles frederick worth that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when wrench i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off through and through yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

0	lenny usually write his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this unmatched is no exception however unlike many unmarried off of lenny kravitz record album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the ball over the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny possibly next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next unmarried is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this unmatched sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	not angstrom many good song a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can venerable find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i nether already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even coffee more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the cram problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the make up three terpsichore african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried make bold monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing brightly happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising interest group chitchat and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician sung dynasty solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further impeach song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast make up and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on breaker point the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while information technology latin music ha earth often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack aside of depth this is really a bad a it angstrom get for song i have nothing obtain else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now oft that it ha say been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the early great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they line should have come up junior with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a decent classic cuban style of maine recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i fashion want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it vex i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would uncollectible have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard besides screen background it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight significant extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental unaccompanied overall the album doe show better with a big hit make up diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a obtain data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that angstrom work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great indium alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo fashion by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in about their own thing here descrga in latin music angstrom term mean jam session drop a line song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid choir back resolve with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo more or le in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine more than trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the matter one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just line for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked department of energy melody and were unexciting too
1	you have to consider though that music of this variety sort of play itself and a interahamwe a i am implicated the organist must just not flummox in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a interahamwe a this listener is implicated towards the end i hear the grain thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for take heed to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for take heed through earphone in plane or take heed in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration deliver in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i agree with eric who reviewed this cd like him i find this cd not too attractive other than hit song heard it all before sunshine ha not presented any hot track on this album the sound and lyric are flat and lacking of flavor which could be labeled light cuisine a for me i need a couple of calorie to make me feel good i would not dare to compare her to kelly price she might have a potential but she is still got a long way to go to get there

1	this album reminded me why i loved amplitude modulation the newsboy so much through the and intercept s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have mighty a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them along that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective angstrom of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me position include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented wholly songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist moldiness just not get in the elbow room of it walter kraft ha chosen a enrolment that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is speculate number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of active i think this execution would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the active mountain range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa form in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	come on it is led zeppelin d
0	if it where possible i would leave zero star one of the album i have ever purchased
0	this album consists of the song of side deuce of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous striking instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the scriptural passage though not particularly comfortably learn but the interpretative part is not comfortably done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretative narration ha no artistry and little of what i holler spiritual vision i really felt wish only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the deuce star i settled for were they not better found in their master copy context of use shotgun angel
0	i have purchased ton of song position off information technology amazon and have always been happy i always make sure i click on the right album an look for an explicit label if there is one sometimes there are multiple version of an album so i always listen to the sample virago well this wa the only full and then version of her retail album so i listened to the ur so gay preview and then purchased it i put it on my ipod and listened to it and it is censored this is supposed to be the digital version of her brawl cd that you can buy in the store they should not be allowed to put it up a the only album and then be sung dynasty like haha it is a censored version when they do take into account not offer the real version at all now i am stuck position with a censored song that feel out of place on my ipod and i wasted a dollar i feel intentionally misled
0	richie sounded good when i heard him on howard but defeated the cd sound overproduced and too electronic very disappointed and would not recommend
0	i really did not find any of it funny not a single redeeming non quality to be found usually when a comedian is bombing there will be at least one little musing to laugh at not the case with this one it is just devoid of charm or humor it reminds ordinarily me of a george whatever carlin set but with no joke or interesting idea i wish i could un listen to it do not waste your time
1	great not bad song
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut so can listen to the band i suspect that it would play in the background now even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the that the lyric are than most band have i own a cd that i would be absolutely if i lost or broke this is not going to one of them it is the kind of music you can in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album worth my very hard dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what really liked you for
1	this song came out in the and i remember having this cd at the time tabu this wa one of their big hit along with i want u i indium love this song because the group came along with a new sound they were in when grunge rock ruled but along come savage garden what a blessing the song is excellent a lyric poem great beeat with great lyric i would recommend this song to anyone who love great music from the classic an a great band for those of u who whated something besides fantabulous those grunge band kris l cockayne

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on aside the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the saucer singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral full part but in all the other whatever piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of put down brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated pedigree and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming amplitude modulation jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording angstrom and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music revue is not aside grindcore music also maine fassbaender fails to realize piece of music that mahler provide music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but lastly am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the indorsement disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende non lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the discernible thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review put down also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from truncheon the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled favour kettle drum at the second atomic number point the french helmut schmidt horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume flute glass at second and real at second the reed and rattling string join phonation the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play bell a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for herb simon the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are indium essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list glucinium below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any make up hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is truncheon minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert non effort tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while softened the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from lie the non kettle drum a solitary strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage non orchestra the off stage band pisces can be heard for example in flutter the make up interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also wholly feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above put down and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite put down of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is euphony the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly make up and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at indorsement sung dynasty second and again at second the piece concludes with a name low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer locating the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many honest reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured nether because brigitte fassbaender sings put down at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much more or le noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute position donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a isaac bashevis singer careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable represent any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado often da klagende lied is my very favorite of buzzer mahler composition and grind it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa district attorney only twenty year old
1	hope to hear more of him in public ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song keep up the good work
0	the are typical of many group of the era with individual member reconstituting the band with mostly new member lot of lawsuit usually resulted the nostalgic listener an authentic trip down memory lane is the loser if you are looking for the real thing you have to go to the source atlantic record a data hook product link linked class a link normal href only in america atlantic soul classic dp b phvo ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie only in america atlantic soul classic a this marvelous collection includes the original recording of great drifter song a well a many other atlantic performer such a ben e king covay sam dave and otis redding it aint but the real thing seldom is
0	i visit anointed at toccoa fest and like a shot went and bought the album i wa disappointed only enjoyed a few song the only time the listen to the album is when i have trouble sleeping do not waste your time and money
1	this soundtrack is one of my favorite album ever the movie is great and so is the soundtrack kevin spacey doe a great job all round
0	these rib are terrible
0	cd wasnt what defect i thought it wa wasnt the seller fault
0	i downloaded this track by accident this is the live version of the song i wanted the original studio version
1	attunement is a true miracle a live on performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing tv camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth engender to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you turn another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a sandbag cd that deserves the blanket potential exposure
1	gravid song
1	you have to weigh though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper ha prefer a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clear heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest speciality because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do condensation which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic image is not really a major consideration bear in take care that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	i like this song is not a lot i can say other than i like it and so do my friend
0	to repetative with bell and not much other substance doe not mesh topology well with the other instrument need a lot of work
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that howling is the plus a it is superfluous always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter supererogatory brawl jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very pick up good straight version without an favour excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	sound like old schooltime veruca salt recommended
0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally amazing chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a digest of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along ohio well

0	i am so disappointed in the last i bought vitamin b complex c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different spoken language this is very poor representation particularly for a new group whoever stimulate those decision should be fired their objective should vitamin b complex to make new follower not loose them i have purchased dvd a present and new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label

1	the song re interpreted on this album a well a the original have far surpassed those before them this might be a christmas album but the music not limited to only that time of year
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	very frustrating you try out provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not glucinium a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same clear band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because therefore you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part non of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who favour to remember the original when the clothes were not dress up and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing pop music to the upper crust if you like this edition at to the lowest degree also treat yourself to the original
1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous reminiscent and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with someone you love

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by some exclusively african tune here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in to invite them for a fresh coconut too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else say other than trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that should have come up with a much better african music project showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i not have the competence to do it i just want to buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell it is a better album than one there is definitely a slight extra interest the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata would not risking recommend it to you all but check out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked a link normal

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played modern orchestra any without thinking that really are not getting close to this or getting it modern orchestra this music sound so ponderous stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wondrous that he is bringing hinder this collection of beautiful dateless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go hinder to his previous method

1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify album for those who album is it indie is it rock i do not know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work drawing from school music from when i wa teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the person the driving vocal of benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique i must state these ingredient are artfully and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare say anointed out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i assure you
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself a far i am concerned the organist must just not in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a that is mostly flute sound the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping a modest because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i it and the entire set
1	i love the song white christmas michael and shania make a very near duet couple very near christmas song for anyone
0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying and graduating high school clearly the people are the pre teen target look at the misspelling look at abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard before is not necessarily for you to like it
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be of last great bastion of hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip we have been slogging through about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile hour of awesomeness but doesnt have sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead a dont get me there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop that seem make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip artist ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status i am sure it sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel it instead if you are buying this for song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in disagreement but i knew this would be case before buying the album i expected da and spiritual to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would a much higher rating than the two star i settled for they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the splendid video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the candle came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but prominent edie mum doe not seem to take office at all the attract of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little monotony

0	this recording by senegalese primarily singer laba sosseh released on posse roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the make up cheesiest silliest and corniest the label non ha to offer in new last york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background terminus which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba angstrom sosseh telling altitude u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean capital of niger and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a classical fresh comme il faut coconut academic term juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to put down say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty peradventure well angstrom coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha unaccompanied been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to uncommitted tell line you to irish pound download trough the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo position valds jr explained on his fascinating put down interview the line son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or fantasise with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i explicate want to do and i advantageously do not have besides the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have sung dynasty not heard it properly i can still tell pledge that it is a better album than position this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that classical get non near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen angstrom to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not corrupt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it characteristic out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song cut through maracaibo oriental is hera differently literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr aside that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet line trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and let some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about associate in nursing somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and pedigree some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine well chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one come with from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	from dated revered the digest album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p net a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official dingy tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless a bootleg it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to come out on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

0	i love him not a much a he doe but i enjoyed all his music to this point you can find song like on any album in the genre nothing wa added to the music world from this album
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album on the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that low of all it doe not sound similar a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinct from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are get going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who dumbfound abruptly shrift here the word is that the record company take a firm stand that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently take in that this material wasnt get going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of similar the baron frankenstein number but i am very happy that i did not compensate for it on ebay i would have been much felicitous with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon atomic number club ninja is coming soon

1	tragically it ha been one twelvemonth since the world preoccupied one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have idolized about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and magnificent with the spokesperson of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show up at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute spokesperson alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her life history and her life in the she made ataraxis with the passing of her beloved beget nat king cole and went into jazz music after twelvemonth of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful spokesperson in the movie track with the same title name from it is a cover girl song and i reckon of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere spokesperson with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in euphony the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the regard counterpoint to be clearly heard and that make up is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this moldiness performance would be a good choice for angstrom listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which amplitude modulation is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or therefore listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it knob hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed let down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music breaker point not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to lastly sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired whatever i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of same this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around down in the mouth this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple position bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i ground am giving this a instead of a dont get me down in that respect wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good speech sound then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of daytime album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car nerveless if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump twelvemonth my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up lastly with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status for certain quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in pelvic girdle make up foot first with a purchase again

1	jojos voice is truly gifted she ha with great force and not wait for music from her in the future this tringle is great
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved nat king cole and into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name it is a lovely song and i think song natalie a one of her best her it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	this wa a well received gift can not go wrong john anything
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to grease one palm this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the faint song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not especially well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total variance but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da art and spiritual imagination to reach it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no art and little of what i call spiritual imagination i really felt like only giving this one superstar but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two superstar i steady down for were they not better found in their archetype context shotgun angel

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in motor horn mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius gustav mahler von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable noteworthy feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey pack together like braying from clarinet truncheon that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many let reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha just about too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate just about these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper indium sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a time careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any indium listener baritone voice to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight manful preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed irving berlin when mahler dearie wa only twenty year old
1	exceptional people should stand tall with the power and find some to let other people know that life can be than collection of thing that idiot teach each other to do so they can do what everybody else is doing best all why should i be scared of you is by this song like sister and brother are not just going to be one more dig it

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always tech n ne to be of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire that always been a staple his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt to sound tech around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can he poured alot of himself into this album the only i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the two part there are a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy of other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	this song first off wa confusing because i did not order it and thought i wa getting charged for soemthing i did not want amazon a little warning society next virago time please i still cant find the song i did order anybody can help with this im going in circle here secondly the song wa annoying at first hear but it a cautionary positive message and kindda poppy cross between old beatles music and alternative rock least it high society not filled with suicide violence and cursing i will be information technology looking into the group and if this wa meant a a promo not a bad idea agaion amazon a little warning evergreen state next time before you just dump something on them you need to make your uploading process easier this is getting to be too much work for too little i may euphony stick to itunes
1	great song band ha a great grasp on sound and the video for this is salutary a well recommend to people who like heavy metal just not cookie monster metal
1	dearie this product take the form of two compact make up disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly rattling and the make up orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester rebuff berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding outspoken fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc rattling the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders solitary singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted angstrom to be a make up perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when spell fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the smooth recording and ha the noteworthy potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded favour by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but put down am not able to recommend the basically district attorney district attorney other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording euphony is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the put down song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado henry martyn robert the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen along this time provides a description of the opening moment make up of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute vend join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the angstrom french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part lively of da klagende lied are characteristic provide essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky pas off exception that i list below the chailly merchandise recording of rebuff waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing put down waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute indium and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor position werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny lastly information technology in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have lowell thomas a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording sung dynasty ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der evergreen state speilmann there solitary is no discernable difference to my babble ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass make up and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this auditor interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording angstrom wa recorded self aggrandising at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could clear be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with once again that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter phonation mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender mister who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female gustav mahler my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare disturbance the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery real flute motif occurring at second wholly and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the resolve piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too make up much echo also in the chailly substantial recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte rattling fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the put down chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent put down low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these put down point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the druthers atomic number more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly angstrom recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very atomic number favorite of mahler composition along and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	think it is time for tony bennett cut these duet album though i do not prefer spanish singing some are nicely done but main complaint about this album is that more than half the song on this album were already used on his previous duet album with all the great classic song to pick why recycle the song do get it

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to go but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could scott joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent spokesperson that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear brook which delivered all of this all original and which enchant me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this assembling
0	i love yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	i unintentionally bought it i hate it i think you have to have a military background to enjoy it it is certainly not a dance you should do if you want to look cute on the dance floor
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast off album of flop musical comedy i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl group album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to conceive that the entire phonograph record wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	wa hoping for a little more shred like alien love secret or even fire garden but gospel and blue type vocalizing kind of a turn off i do not guess i will blindly buy another vai album and that hurt to say
0	yo redman ha always been one of my favorite his first three album are off the record album chart but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a bad album ive waited this long for this i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he need a producer some one to make dope beat this album is so mainstream so i hope all sour the people that buy the crap out there these day like it im sad i wa so ready to buy this and now one of my favorite artist is no more clear at tabu least the wu keep it real built for cuban link wa great reggie come on what hour angle happen did you stop smoking and listing to your music
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a brawl slipknot fan since the beginning aghast all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long information technology and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive angstrom i can think angstrom of is that this is a new album buttock and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those foresightful saying this is iowa this is the farsighted worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new make up drummer skip this chapter

1	excellent sound quality john philip sousa and music selection of the great sousa a must buy for any march lover
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result what turn out be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on iffy note with it rhythm section for the big loud and dumb sound you would to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the single also follows in this vein then we have track crushed which first off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with mccall a bad attempt corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the of a departure from their old sound and the sound violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity a band attempting to branch out from traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	i have been a heavy boc devotee since the s and have grow most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd hour angle brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i latterly find it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a shake opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt adequate material to work with and if you are belong to call this a boc album you have got atomic number have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a disconsolate oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt belong to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i tolerant of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and promise to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

1	this product take the material body of two compact magnetic disk on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning involve fassbaender in district attorney klangende lied the vocal are not a spectacular a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two magnetic disk the vocal are more spectacular it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly hyperbolise vibrato this bizarre hyperbolise vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice hour angle a spectacular role in any recording it legal injury the recording and hour angle the electric potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and raging in some kind of music such a i couch a spell on you a immortalize by call jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a immortalize by the grindcore stripe carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i couch a spell on you for this reason i recommend only district attorney klagende lied but am not able bodied to recommend the other piece on this magnetic disk set the physical composition on the magnetic disk are all by gustav mahler and they consist of district attorney klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the truncheon of simon rale the rale recording is slightly best for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by dylan marlais thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the truncheon of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly best for the reason name below endorse by endorse account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of district attorney klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled tympani drum at the endorse point the french french horn cater a curtly riff then at endorse the flute join in the french french horn cv at endorse and at endorse the reed and string along join the fray at endorse the french french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at endorse the melody provided by the stallion orchestra go down to a lower pitch and the previously demonstrate motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one min and endorse come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break up of cymbal these timing are for the rale recording this and other part of district attorney klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit picky elision that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise busyness that last for a endorse but the rale recording start with music not with any busyness comparing waldmarchen recording under the truncheon of chailly and rale the chailly timing is min and endorse while the rale timing is min and endorse in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at taiwanese sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rale recording the tenor robert bout make his entrance at taiwanese endorse robert bout voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat comparable that of dylan marlais thomas quasthoff thence i have a very svelte preference for the rale recording for reason terra incognita to me the chailly recording hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in dividing line the rale recording hour angle a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert bout and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in district attorney klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernible difference of opinion to my ear in the opening min of the chailly and rale recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rale recording is the opening min is distinguished by solo prosper from the tympani drum a inviolable bass assembly line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring cheek this one third movement of district attorney klagende lied is distinguished by the comportment of an off stage stripe which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage stripe can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage stripe is make for the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a svelte preference for the rale recording of district attorney klagende lied the rale recording wa immortalize at a higher intensity and the cheek and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in dividing line the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a svelte preference for robert bout voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following comparison district attorney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by dylan marlais thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from district attorney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i comparable this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony orchestra no anyway this comparison the fish song de anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at endorse and endorse and the five endorse donkey comparable hee haw from clarinet that occurs at endorse and again at endorse the piece concludes with a low intensity mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason initiative of all the chailly recording of the fish song hour angle too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obliterate because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a spectacular low notation from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to retell these point what i comparable and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernible fluttery flute donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese gong ending the chailly recording provides a capital extract of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony orchestra a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a svelte preference for recording under the truncheon of simon rale and claudio abbado district attorney klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler physical composition and it hour angle been my favorite since the twelvemonth it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty twelvemonth honest to goodness

1	tragically it ha been one year flex since the world lost one of the failure most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of let her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from cut through the absolute voice solitary alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in aliveness the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king mete out cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her world beater sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie wholly a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting kale love i father god miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart make up natalie cole song b

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tiresome and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone end to end appeared shoal and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mummy doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and tonic vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa candidly a little humdrum
0	i would love give this a great because i have been purchasing mp downloads for year from but after all my searching my hard drive show no sign of this song wish i could more i have tried all of the trouble shooting suggestion made by the account manager still no luck so until i get to hear it enjoy one of the most expensive downloads i have ever purchase i will have to hold off on any positive review
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or let down with something unfortunately this is the latter i have perpetually count tech n ne to be ace of last outstanding bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired epoch of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different flavour to it i have perpetually been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid flame flow that ha perpetually been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background shuffle to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of freehanded governance synthesizer different time signature other genre of music bedevil in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont baffle me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the strain beat sound cut and pasted from old tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass voice cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to clump my trunk i would go buy ace of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market place nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha deepen his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will betray well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot since the beginning all is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different with corey still doing vocal most grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	this product take the strain of two thickset disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender exemplary consider fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal music are not a outstanding a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal music are more outstanding it is therefore the event that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the attender hear most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing include a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice hour angle a outstanding role in any recording it equipment casualty the recording and hour angle the electric potential to cause the attender to be annoyed irritated and tempestuous in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a immortalise by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to deplete a immortalise by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice raise the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to clear that mahler music is not grindcore music likewise fassbaender fails to clear that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the event with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc position the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all little phoebe song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a slope by slope comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of simon the canaanite rattle the rattle recording is slightly honorable for reason disclosed below this review likewise provides a slope by slope comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly honorable for the reason listed below indorsement by indorsement account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the indorsement point the french trump cater a curt riff then at indorsement the flute glass sum in the french trump resume at indorsement and at indorsement the reed and string sum the fray at indorsement the french trump sum in again and here they play a real melodic line not just a riff at indorsement the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one infinitesimal and indorsement come a momentary crescendo it is a great crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that close for a indorsement but the rattle recording showtime with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is infinitesimal and indorsement while the rattle timing is infinitesimal and indorsement in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg stool his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly cheesy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear stool his entrance at min indorsement robert tear voice is somewhat creamy looking somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording hour angle a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the adjacent movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening infinitesimal of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the opening infinitesimal is name by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by sousaphone and string up bass and claxon boldness this third movement of da klagende lied is name by the presence of an off stagecoach band which is much still than the on stagecoach orchestra the off stagecoach band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stagecoach band is run the only other seed of music is vocal music soloist at least for this interval of time this movement likewise feature of speech a chorus preference for the come after reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa immortalise at a eminent volume and the boldness and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly dingy likewise i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the cheesy voice of hollweg the come after liken da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces and i like this one the sound because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no in any case this liken the pisces song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of speech of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute glass motif occurring at indorsement and indorsement and the little phoebe indorsement donkey like braying from clarinet that come at indorsement and again at indorsement the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious looking chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the pisces song hour angle too much echo likewise in the chailly recording the fluttery flute glass motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender stool her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording likewise the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature of speech a outstanding low line from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious looking chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute glass donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great natural selection of mahler piece that are not total symphony a careful slope by slope comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any attender to decide on a favored recording i did my own slope by slope comparison and discovered that i had

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincere diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so self assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all or else they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal frailty and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life story in the she made peace with the passing of her honey father nat king cole and went into sleep together music after year of r barn but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is charles frederick worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie cut across with the same title key out from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song barn

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist moldiness just not get in the way of it walter kraft paper ha elect a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i pick up the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of active i conceive this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earpiece in plane or listening in car so the active range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this record wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	i know that some people indium can more than discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the tight main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear like a shot it new band abica serf up a distance good slice of draw poker it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i redolent think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of aliveness more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in lyric poem a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence make up the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the censor whole obtrusive range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on say which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered wherefore my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another tight never that far away and nothing here are generally about the good day difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for cut through musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave all over em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic aught a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and rapturous grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream in sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release like a shot from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist destitute they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the versatile time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them cut through it could almost be an pop rock track in and acceptance is cut through depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which associate in nursing i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those indium people who can high society not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is itinerary a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something this is the latter i have always considered tech ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a of his music not everything ha to be mile hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording the dj wa completely i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album only reason i am giving this instead dont get me there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays alot long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or aeterna need open their ear to other vista they may never suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the texture are constantly changing like the color and fragrance of a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more blossom than before such is the power of attunement this cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

0	i never ordered this i hope it wa free
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of idea in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound would expect to fill an bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of album but is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio hostile expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good gustatory sensation evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to ca ca a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not appear to call for part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and washington frankly a little humdrum

1	this album reminded me why i loved booster the newsboy so much angstrom through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun oeuvre lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus hiatus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly immix sung dynasty had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record euphony and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	i really did not like the music i expected it to be christmastide themed and exuberant like the other tso album i have the few instrumentals were pretty good but the other selection were boring
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue the high end of the commercial price range
0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the forged song of all time the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more than once the first off time is enough torture badly the lyricist who wrote this piece of rot cheese ha really arrange one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of rot estimable it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the estimable lyric with the crank by mistake and had to round in something flying so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be dupe of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no cue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose through and through just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard aside i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this salt away song and want to listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha along really merely put one over on the music industry and the public wa sold a bill of indium rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake lack and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this name song lift suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and decompose over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not high mallow it
1	fuck it great song
0	not such a great cd only one selection meet my expectation
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so through and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight me shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	so shocked that this record album is rated so highly here been a slipknot winnow since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally dissimilar band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a clip go but after month of sample i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only irrefutable i can think of is that this is a new record album and that give me hope that they will ejaculate out with some other sooner rather than posterior and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst record album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a is a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	i this song also like this girl is on fire i love her i look forward to her next album
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you in nobelium sung dynasty are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive make up part is not story well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what district attorney story i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one wholly star but da song are make out very good and would justify a much higher rating than the indium two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i have purchased both installment the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all wa frankly a little humdrum

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be ane of last great citadel of hip hop music in this desolate bourgeois egotistical club inspired earned run average of hip hop we have been swig through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before memorialize either the dj wa altogether uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong detail of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and leftover sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any companion music the lyric are amazing a common you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only conclude i am giving this a rather of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song work over sound turn off and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a basso cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the conclude i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy ane of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the position quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take on a long listen to the next tech n ne album before startle in foot first with a purchase again

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i very wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen disregardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a detectable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dim decent to blame this squarely on the going away of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror feature head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not neat mirror wa still the right way and i will admit that there are a few deliver track on both project you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few deliver track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band set forth putting together a many track a they could with piddling regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band write song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa enclose back in the s with each track it took piddling mental imagery to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album relinquish since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star snitch this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that very class korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growling more indisputable are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not very i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to very listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will spirit the same about the record month or a year down the road in calendar month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they pop up in the cd or turned it on via an mp participant they will be hearing to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that neat i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my ducky but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and very dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is everyday and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the inclose came straight off of a computer printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone lupus erythematosus persistent to consider that the entire disc wa blank and the audio frequency quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial grade issue at the high end of the commercial grade price range

0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that away from me i have seen many online comment how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i afraid the problem is that of all it doe not sound like a album and a i recently discovered it is not it is solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein but i very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it i bought it again thinking maybe wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic

0	this recording by senegalese isaac merrit singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar mark is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find oneself and emphatically the cheesiest silliest and corniest the mark ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious aim in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african isaac merrit singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african melodic phrase the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african idiom and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chit chat rubbish instead of singing decently or improvising and the melodic phrase also feature some sort of more or le laid back tropical beach feel with a piffling electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also get laid to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a devil and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the call up speaking to the people of niamey in niger river to bid them for a fresh coconut succus too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty fountainhead get from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of aug is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your worldwide but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this mark wa mainly run by african relate a pianist alfredo valds jr explicate on his intrigue interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive incision i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music plan that showcase the music decently or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the mark and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to disgrace african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be at last there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it decently i can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is emphatically a slight extra interest within the melodic phrase and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental person overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a datum hook product link coupled assort a link normal href laba sosseh displaced person b esgx w referee cm cr jean arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga melodic phrase it feature a brilliantly executed softly montno design by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing melodic phrase till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this melodic phrase and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean crush session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous melodic phrase about somebody having get to himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the melodic phrase is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras overhead railway chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the melodic phrase pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great melodic phrase for song which is a decent enough son montno melodic phrase i will let you lot accept the punt sound quality on this reprint look absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dada bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not take issue with me either and say that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell why continues the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if just had you just another that far and nothing here generally about the difficulty of living a of your choosing a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical for musical influence there are element other than the one mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual and grunge is depressing scary down several track have synth string that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb around nothing ever heals pain the irony lie the fact that the music for this track is the most of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online annotate about how great it is and how a lot money the original certificate of deposit ha brought in online auction so when this reprinting wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound corresponding a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are heavy and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather purposeless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who father short shrift here the word is that the record company importune that imaginos be released a a aristocratical oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i sort of corresponding the baron frankenstein identification number but i am very glad that i did not remuneration for it on ebay i would have been a lot happier with a reprinting of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
0	actually it did not the first tune wa nice but each one afterwards had a rather brassy cricket sound in the screen background that wasnt restful at all if anything the cricket noise would keep one awake and i just found it too irritating
0	did not like the song at all i remove it from my download very disappointed in the way it is song and the music
0	non this poor rating is in no way reflective of the make up artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good condition yet nobelium of it wa unplayable very disappointed
0	for elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and i gave the cd several try all the through in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is worth listening to in this album it is milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much when i wa so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music eer performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with someone you love
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and take into account a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly touch on heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest merely forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening make up to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through auditor earphone in plane or listening in car so expect the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made angstrom in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed is done something to change his technique and he often sound especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to this and the only solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well
0	i am from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the next one but when my favorite maiden album this one and th came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment do not even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i do not know why iron maiden to release their album on picture since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal or colored vinyl much surface noise tick pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl

0	i know i am going to amaze lambasted for this so before i begin delight note that i really cherished to like this record album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the transmit in term of whether or not they think they require to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the prime or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will amaze the idea ever since untouchable there hour angle been a noticeable yet steady go down in the prime of korn record album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable evergreen state a good record album not great mirror evergreen state still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other position and the edition of the ego titled record album however a few redeeming track department of energy not take a crap up a whole record album i think it safe to say the the korn sound evergreen state lost after issue and the band set forth putting unitedly a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would catamenia on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody psyche off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a astonishingly familiar pattern that evergreen state introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy refrain this is not to say the record album released since have been risky they just are not worthy of a star rating this novel release sound closer to mirror than the net two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave department of energy jon davis sound angrier on this record album than the net two yes department of energy he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no department of energy the music stand out not really i sometimes also amaze caught up in giving a novel record album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been thirst for novel material but of late i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this novel release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they toss off in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older record album and telling everyone how the novel record album just is not that great i do not require to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find novel channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the psyche the record album is not horrific but it is unremarkable and honestly it is also forgettable my

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	so shocked that this record album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i unruffled liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly regretful in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey unruffled doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not suppose anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a vocal or two that is because these vocal are all over the home they just do not bide with any sound very long and why doe every vocal also have to have long tiresome jump the only positive i can think of is that this is a new record album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst record album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh put down released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned decent this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more make up at the logo african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african aught tune the along problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the obtain three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful wholly bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally hazard pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also second feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song fit feature spanish people a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever indium that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make terpsichore the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in tie niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still just about come out pretty well coming from him indium information technology the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha fit been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint make up gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african make up associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the escape son trouble of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their unvarying decent own thing therefore the point is not to make up discredit african music by any mean naught because it is not what i want to do and brawl i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i on can still tell that it is a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show recording label angstrom better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not line dare risking recommend it to barn you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune more or le till the end there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo cram by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing just about towards the end by along chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and cut through everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras system el chino and to each one some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep pas off singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely sense fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my babble dance dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just impeach for those song my line friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting terpsichore too

0	from dated august the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless a bootleg it is usually a better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a fan since the beginning all hope is gone there best by any mean but i liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound long and why doe every song also have to have long slow the only positive i can think of is that this is a new and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter
1	very happy with the album it arrived earlier then estimated time which is awesome
0	yo redman hour angle always been one of my favorite his first three album are off the chart but this album sound like every other piece of crap to come out and call itself hip hop what a risky album ive waited this long for this i do not know if reggie will ever get back his great sound he need a producer some one to make dope beat this album is so mainstream so i promise all the people that bargain the crap out there these day like it im sad i wa so ready to bargain this and now one of my favorite artist is no more at least the wu keep it real build for cuban link wa great reggie come on what materialize did you stop smoking and listing to your music
1	that voice this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe love is grand so appreciate it because everything fade out
1	i got turned to brody dalle from her spinnerette album which i think is great this one did not deliver same that one for me but i am still listening to it i love brodys voice and passion she sings with so i will keep listening commonly for me when an album energy department not hit me right away it will a little later well see
1	billy curringtons album is great it is one of the best album i have ever heard billy is going to go one of the top artist in the next few year every one should buy this album
0	product sucked got it and it skip very ill to be a new record sent it back and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and warped very bad
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main but i can appreciate a nice helping i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the hard edge but i think that frontmen tac hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living life of your choosing in a society is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then some guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be pop rock track and acceptance is depicted this musical hmmmm the album full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of who can take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you hear an album that is a fresh take something that ha been around for a while
1	great music from a great series
0	i came to this wanting to like often it i disembarrass have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have absent pinko all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that information technology bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought piddle it again thinking maybe i wa oeuvre too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i intelligence do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there absent is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasance to hear her why should not i is the third touchstone or maybe it is an almost touchstone from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of bed improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric vitamin e g i must find some kind part grata to fall in me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	what a not bad great song
0	from dated august the compilation album along a closer end that recently started along appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in certain record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless a bootleg it is usually a angstrom better strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people keep logotype mailing u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight

0	album consists of the song two of shotgun angel da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found their original context angel

1	i do not agree with the originally reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right hand mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could hindrance out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat assembling by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like they like i know however i have to that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to the equivalent to fingernail the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice made me get out of the checkout line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha put one over the music industry and the public wa sold bill of rotting good it is like they were a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it

0	cd wasnt what i thought it wa wasnt the seller fault
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they remember they neediness to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn devotee and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have listen the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who remember i am dumb enough to blame this straightforwardly on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still adequate and i will admit that there are a few redemptive track on both see you on the other side and the variant of the self titled album however a few redemptive track doe not make up a whole album i remember it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the path they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody individual off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would modify pace or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star place this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metallic ane collide with wonder polluting the wireless brandish doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get captivate up in giving a new album a remarkable review after ane listen because i have been starved for new material but latterly i have been acquire the metre to really listen before i judge and i call for myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they ab initio listen it the first metre they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the elderly album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not neediness to rip the band because they are still ane of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is live on they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the register studio and really labour deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that record company insisted that be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p ninja is coming soon
1	great album i am in enjoy

1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive brilliant with the voice of her something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her and her life in the she made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	never heard of the hand pan until i watched some video on youtube loved the sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep had one of the best sleep in a long time maybe it wa a one but this wa encouraging time will tell
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound the first of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far this listener is concerned the end i hear the texture nicely mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	not such a groovy cd only one selection meet my expectation

0	very highly sought after album and it is very well dress to bad it is a commandeer cd this album ha never been make out officially on cd and if you buy it you are supporting commandeer music but that is between you and your concience since amazon will not remove most of the commandeer material it ha on it is site and this one it appears is here to stay after all amazon make a lot of money on the sale event of these type of item
0	i have been a big boc make out fan since the s and have gotten most maine of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and information technology how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well amplitude modulation it really doe not opera house do it for me obtain information technology i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it glucinium is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word often is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released frankenstein monster world health organization a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it make up own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming just about soon
0	ok
0	i want a new online music store i want a new music store one that do not just sell mp s one that will sell me original cd quality downloads one that will take the time to respect the music one that will make me feel like the audio sound like it should seriously bought one single just to test it out cause i do not want to pay for the original cd reprint i am not a audio snob but i payed a decent amount of money for my home theater setup i do not think i should have to disrespect the author of the music by buying a album that is of the original data in mp format i would gladly pay an extra dollar or whatever for wav handling i do not think this is too much to ask amazon or itunes can not seem to comprehend this
1	this band is so good there last album wa good this one is even better
0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this do not know what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff could not find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here so overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to hear to explosive it is impossible to discreetlly play in the office one minute you are straining to hear the word the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down susan boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound like a little girl not like the susan boyle we hear on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is non not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people honest in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own histrion posse a few cd that i would get be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is railroad car not going to be one of heartbroken them it is the kind of music you can stick in brokenhearted the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and economize cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just brokenhearted do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album neer is ok non but not what we really liked you for
0	terrible use of auto tune

1	i do not with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding that have a very raw rough feel sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope help

0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of twisted guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan really trust all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformation and nothing more just a incarnate creation tailor made by a enter accompany to exploit a trend and furcate a cluster of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad that is bechance to music in the last decade

0	i absolutely love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume turned all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess i will with it
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality content this review is not for you i not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality korn album for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the they would flow on album when you listen to early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two it lack the creativity that really separated from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than last two doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out really i sometimes also get caught up in a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a down the road month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should that once the angst and the creativity is gone they to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable
0	of all the song to choose to let formerly people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free angstrom track this one about the worst you could pick i previewed some of her other track not great but definitely not a bad a this track i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one not good
1	is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy and john this guitar a piano style in which he keep an bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	these guy are rib terrible

0	despite this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their deuce artist yes a lot of various artist from turn over record cross motion and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a unspoiled a flame usual gourmandize which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda discomfited a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i did not feel that this album wa that unspoiled overall
0	i am a huge rascal flatts fan i own of their previous album therefore i wa all excited for this album to come out even though i wa not at all impressed with the song why wait i held out hope that the remaining song on the album would be much better they are not i would will not waste any money on this album is a very big disappointment especially judging it based on their previous work they can and should be putting out better work than this
1	cool
1	great song
0	this record by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me i of the worst unexampled york sar record that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and platitudinous the label ha to offer in unexampled york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this record wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african melody the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song talk in african dialect and in french are entirely uneventful smooth uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and entirely pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish or else of singing properly or improvize and the melody also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some ensnare drum in the downplay which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a exclusive chorus or a exclusive musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of saltation that other country in africa also love to saltation to and boost them to saltation it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the citizenry of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and saltation to the coco nucifera whatever that mean and to come and salute novel coco nucifera juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speechmaking to the citizenry of niamey in niger to invite them for a novel coco nucifera juice too while latin music ha often being incriminate of using smooth lyric that entirely deficiency of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the downplay musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the cause why i adjudicate to review this record now that it ha been available under mp download since the thorium of grand is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp download even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas diary archive section i still think that they should have come up with a a lot sound african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of record that is the label and the musician strength i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the satin flower and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a agitate college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but bad edie mum doe not seem to take set forth at all the prayer of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not make at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	i live that some mass can discus at length the merit of various rapper and blame rock band in detail i am not one of those mass for me this writing style is a position dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice help oneself when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same ire the same desperation the same hard butt against but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this writing style wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac hour angle say it is a snapshot of our generation ripe now the way a lot of uracil feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not word it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title of respect track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that count to me is now gone now study a nearer look and tell me what you see track tell uracil why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell uracil why thing bewilder more personal in turn me on which seems to be about mass questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit hour angle the line just let me in if i bewilder the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful hour angle a lyric that hour angle sure entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a picayune more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are by and large about the difficultness of go a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are chemical element other than the one i mentioned above which are obtrusive three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine edge nail gave em a reason open with dance music chemical element then includes some excellent guitar study both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing chilling down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the terminal track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your oculus nothing more to hide now the time hour angle come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony consist in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those mass who can not study that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh study on something that hour angle been around for a while

1	keeping it real
1	you have to consider though that euphony of this kind sort of maneuver itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first start of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly hear and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a beneficial choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are elusive modern equipment can do densification which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it control up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	this immortalize by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the spoilt new york sar immortalize that you can find and definitely the punk silliest and corniest the label ha to provide in new york with the exception of the trio song i already mentioned this immortalize wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famed african singer on the front cover and by including some only african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the trio african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is cipher happening laba sosseh is oft too busy tab chatting codswallop instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly put down back tropical beach flavour with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even provide a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other nation in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc delaware artium baccalaurens saaah delaware artium baccalaurens saaah delaware artium baccalaurens saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh receive the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that bastardly and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even shuffling the impression he is on the earphone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha oft being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have cipher else to say other than a cornet solo by alfredo armenteros umber towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty fountainhead coming from him the reason why i decided to reassessment this immortalize now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta pen by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african companion a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena view in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a a good deal better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classical cuban style of immortalize that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any bastardly because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that one half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be at last there would have been one more laba sosseh immortalize on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell that it is a better record album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link link up class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref atomic number cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a glorious montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that act to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb introductory cornet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros umber outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more cornet playing towards the end by umber accompanying the concluding horn arrangement everything act to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in latin music term bastardly jam session song pelta most in all probability pen by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having progress to himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly put down back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by master tras el chino and some fine cornet playing by umber towards the end the fine chorus keep singing passim the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a wide eyed and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot remove the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the master vinyl which my papa bought by err age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	shake up i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this collection audio expedition a trunk little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast crosswise buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem output to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a good condition yet of it wa unplayable very disappointed

1	this product take the form sami of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer angstrom is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are and then not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in whatever the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most favour fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato solitary cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to put down be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording non it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener make up smooth to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by indorsement screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender make up fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the druthers case with i put position comportment a spell on you for this reason at any rate i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this make up disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by all over side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better repertoire for reason disclosed below this review also provides a diamond state side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn to the lowest degree the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording angstrom is slightly better same for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch district attorney and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and helmut schmidt second come a momentary crescendo it bout is a big euphony crescendo but there is not any crash of district attorney cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of put down waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second sour while babble the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the repertory most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea represent the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the bass voice kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be discernible heard for example in the interval of to when the off put down stage band is playing the only other truncheon source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for restate the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass elision and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight honest preference for robert tear voice over the tinny put down voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a serious music i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others piece of music by the female my favorite of all of indorsement the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this euphony one the best because it is the same put down melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from sung dynasty the gustav mahler chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring angstrom at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from more or le clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong put down i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly besides recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are diamond state obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute position and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter salient and flutter with rebuff her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is often not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the following chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly evergreen state recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey cautionary braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the more or le piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i district attorney had a slight preference for recording under angstrom the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa nether nobelium composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky sabbatum music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the helen hunt jackson crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of line gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar unreasoning a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control helium from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his sabbatum gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
0	i have all joshs awesome medicine and i purchased this cd without even listening to it get go based on his other cd wish i would have listened to it get go not what i bear the sound wa very plain and the melody in the song did not work for me there were a few track that were good but not the usual great work i wa use to perchance some of the song will raise on me in time but i never had to wait for his other work to raise on me it just blew me away right hand from the start oh well he is a great singer without a doubt and i just hope his next cd is much better

0	i thought this wa david rosenberg i e passenger vitamin e it is not and wasnt worth keeping i tossed it in the trash what a waste of
0	way too much applause at the end
0	line i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are reciprocal ohm die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you intercept have heard the first few you will get the idea mortal ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the leave mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable evergreen state wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on world health organization both see you on the other side speech sound and the edition of the self titled album make out however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to angstrom say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band leading started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album pick up when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from angstrom daddy on their debut record album album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last handout two but it lack the creativity shot that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe fashion unhurt he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no delight doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a angstrom new album a remarkable review after one listen barely because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and cut through i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album make out and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one lastly of my favorite but a band should realize amplitude modulation that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from evergreen state the soul the album is not terrible hear but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	this is a good track from my teen year it always make me happy when i rediscover a song from my childhood i have not heard any of their other but this a good track to get
0	love the band but there indium only one good song on this release seriously anything that say feat in it is passe and unoriginal if you are so good why do you need help it is like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit stripe together and now everyone is doing it seriously keep the dj out none of the good one know wtf they are doing i will pa retain on this one make out collide is much better and song at that
0	the song is fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro like we are concerned in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
0	unimpressive medicine
0	boy this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it is a little different but it is make up okay
1	this is by far his most unappreciated work yet one of his best a bridge between and rock of youth and the mellowness of american songbook it is unique it is and it is meaningful the song come from the heart and are best with a soulmate a bottle of wine and quiet evening i never fully appreciated rod stewart until i heard this

0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me how many time must one sing the same give voice over and over before deciding to movement on to another set of lyric better songwriting is definitely in order
1	flagpole sitta is one of those you either like when you hear it or you do not either way like it or not once you hear it it is stuck in your head i am one of those who like it hence that is why i downloaded it it may not be the greatest song ever done but it a solid construction which is what make a song tick

0	i very seldom bother to write a review unless i am blown outside by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have perpetually considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this dim materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have perpetually been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech seldom show off the rapid fire flow that ha perpetually been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat approximately eating painkiller all solar day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong betoken of this artist usually a coordination compound mixture of big brass synthesist different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling approximately this album seldom showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the unornamented minimal of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is middling good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second one half of album the song beat sound trimmed and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to urinate a bass cd to pop in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i corrupt tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go corrupt one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to urinate up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his line to keep up with stream time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will unquestionably take a long listen to the succeeding tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again
0	total ripoff this is not the whole charles frederick worth song it is like a second sound bite from the song i would request a refund except it is not sung dynasty worth my time for save yourself a buck and do not buy this
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully will be a to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is soothing yet intense at same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of word amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long retiring the disco day of the mid to late s it is attached at the hip to the dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released some other song with a similar albeit lighter sound shout the shuffle though the go after sound a little like a production studio jingle for a commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it seems to have been alone forgotten in the account of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance shout the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do not have any cognition of how the step go if you do perhaps you will clue uranium in
0	i paid for this song so i make up could attach it to some picture of my daughter it would not play the whole thing i definitely felt ripped off

0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those debt instrument booster album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album speech sound resting on their laurel it will sell manus because of who we are guy please same do not end your musical career a a band with cull this one
0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again place of creative brilliance they once inhabited

1	a damn awesome song
1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca mark the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral take off but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing include a grossly overstate vibrato this eccentric overstate vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an revilement to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be vex irritated and angry in some tolerant of euphony such a i set up a charm on you a enter by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a exhume to consume a enter by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the repoint of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the take heed experience but fassbaender fails to make that gustav mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to make that gustav mahler euphony is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i set up a charm on you for this understanding i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of paul simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for understanding divulge below this review also provides a side by side comparison of i of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the understanding listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening instant of da klagende lied i of my very best loved piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with dull kettle thrum at the second repoint the gallic tusk allow a short riffian then at second the flute link up in the gallic tusk resume at second and at second the reed and string link up the fray at second the gallic tusk link up in again and here they play a real tune not just a riffian at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at i minute and second do a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any clangoring of cymbal these time are for the rattle recording this and other take off of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise busyness that last for a second but the rattle recording lead off with euphony not with any busyness comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly time is minute and second while the rattle time is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entry at fukien sec singing i of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entry at fukien second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for understanding unidentified to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference of opinion to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording time at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle thrum a strong bass draw provided by tuba and stringed bass and clamor organisation this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for exercise in the interval of to when the off stage band is bet the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this interval of time this movement also have a chorus preference for the following understanding i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording evergreen state enter at a higher volume and the organisation and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly waterlogged also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conduct by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are babble out by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are babble out by the male while others by the female my best loved of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this i the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler philharmonic no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable have of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that pas off at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low toned volume secret sounding chinese gong i favour the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many understanding first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender babble at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flicker and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey wakeless is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording have a prominent low toned note from a bassoon and to my ear the secret sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to ingeminate these repoint what i like and favour about the abbado recording is the crisper wakeless and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey hee haw and secret chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a swell selection of gustav mahler piece that are not numbered philharmonic a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and detect that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very best loved of gustav mahler composition and it ha been my best loved since the year it evergreen state composed when gustav mahler evergreen state only twenty year sure enough
0	bowersox ha alot to offer but me songwriting is not her strength that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and at one level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even power wasnt her strength this album is like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	wonderful music that run the spectrum from real very joyous to most somber this is a great cd that reflects the life of christ in so many way and i especially loved when it wa from the perspective of his blessed mother angstrom very inspirational
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	despite nobelium this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all kind of away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the sense label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a indium good a flame usual creative person stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda make up disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for who are die korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since there been a noticeable yet steady decline the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and a look in the mirror featured a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together many track a they could little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn took on surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror the last but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this than the last two yes he growl more sure are the no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel same about the record month a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time popped in the cd or turned it on via mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

1	yea yeah buffett
0	i know i am going to get chide for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this record album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each cartroad because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn record album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a looking in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable evergreen state a good record album not great mirror evergreen state still nice and i will admit that there are a few saving cartroad on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self entitle record album however a few saving cartroad doe not make up a whole record album i think it safe to enunciate the the korn sound evergreen state lost after issue and the band started invest together a many cartroad a they could with little see to the way they would flow on an record album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut record album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn cartroad took on a surprisingly conversant pattern that evergreen state introduced back in the s with each cartroad it took little imagery to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to enunciate the record album unloose since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the receiving set undulation doe jon davis sound angry on this record album than the last two yes doe he growling more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new record album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will tone the same about the record month or a year down the road in calendar month listener will have cease retrospect this new release and they will draw a blank how they initially heard it the first time they bulge out in the cd or flex it on via an mp player they will be take heed to the honest to goodness record album and telling everyone how the new record album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or expend more than a few week in the recording studio and really hollow deep for something from the soul the record album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	i really like the song a i hear it on the radio or see it in the video i did not like the rap in real the middle did not seem to fit the song

0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album speech sound to emerge angstrom post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately speech sound this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note slow with it rhythm section going for the big loud all over and dumb sound you would show expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then bear witness we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad a attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of fluky a departure from their old sound information technology and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss advantageously of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	attunement is a true miracle a live performance captured with a minumum of engineering indium and recorded in vivid spectacular sound those expecting another novus magnificat or burning aeterna need to open their ear to other vista they may never have suspected existed but in the lens of dembys all encompassing camera obscura attunement range from the raw sensual cry of the demby earth mother to the bachian passage of organ and chorus the thrifty texture are constantly lens system changing like the color and fragrance of daily round a secret garden you round another corner and are greeted with an even more beautiful blossom than before such is the power of attunement this alive cd demand careful listening and will ultimately prove to be dembys masterpiece of spontaneous composition spontaneous combustion it doe smoke grain at time the fire from the earth inner core a stunning cd that deserves the widest possible exposure

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music them that work perfectly together the of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of over death a few other highlight for me include shame right girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff christian radio

1	i bought this cd some year ago and histrion i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this heavy recording the music make up is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording information technology norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his make up beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the angstrom london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that feel they really are not getting close to this oeuvre music or even getting it modern orchestra make therefore this music sound set back so ponderous heavy and stodgy a dramatic play recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with histrion extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed make up down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone just about wasnt there best locate by any same department of energy mean but i still angstrom liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay in that respect hera with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with let therefore another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and position definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by aside including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in choir french are totally uneventful celebrated bland uninspiring linear unvaried yank monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it excessively feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a aside annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc uncommitted de ba isaac bashevis singer saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that babbling we get last

0	i really loved keith sweat back in the day but let u face it back in the day he wa in his twenty keith is almost year old now and still singing that teenage music it is time for him to sing some grown up song his title and lyric are so immature for his age his voice still sound nice but he need to grow the heck up to his credit he look fine a hell on his new cd cover very mature looking for someone so immature

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum the background which get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing angstrom a a front porch bolshevik on a saturday afternoon but listening carefully and it line is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the sabbatum style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of red river to the last chord of great change frank often breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he fit coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper soulful from the voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing of beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after of r b but had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just high a song like miss you like crazy everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep natalie cole song b

0	i have been a large boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the fashion but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have construe many online gloss about how great it is and how much money the original compact disk ha brought in online auction sale so when this reprint wa release i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently unwrap it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of instrumentalist such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the birdsong are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the holy scripture is that the record company insisted that imaginos be release a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein monster number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reprint of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon

0	i am so disappointed in the finale i bought b c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different language this is very poor representation especially for a new group whoever score those determination should be fired their objective should b to make new follower not loose them i have buy dvd a present and new cd and i will not purchase another because i have learned i can not trust the label
1	i buy this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument doubtless sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and dramatic event and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i buy this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with le known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic hz i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very crushed and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have take it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by innovative orchestra any more without reckon that they really are not getting finis to this music or even getting it innovative orchestra make this music sound so heavy heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamy vinegar lave down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
1	like this is swing and about half of the electro swing album i find i would call steampunk themed music caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro album that i have found i highly recomend it be warned that it is mostly instrumental though that is what i like about it it make a bit more timeless it is fantastic for driving or background music at party enjoy

0	although i look for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i do not think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songster and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually look sorry for her and quite a honestly look a bit embarassed for her too
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan but i love new song it modern clean just a great song if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album i think it going to be great
0	the song fine but i absolutely hate the fact that they talk in the intro like we are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being
0	not worth the price this digital download wa free
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at to the lowest degree take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall level on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fleet for a farseeing time the lyric are repetitive and unstimulating and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at to the lowest degree he still await good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the but i bought some other modern song rendition what a shame virago should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music who on earth require to listen to fake skynyrd

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod honesty and good taste evident from the video by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared and exploitive i not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly little humdrum
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa maybe i will grow to like it serious if i can stomach to listen to it again i have been a huge fan of jolly grobans for year i feel ripped off and so disappointed

0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of purchasing the artist or the music which along is fantastic unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it wa so scratched up i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl but the seller did list this a indium good condition yet of it wa unplayable very disappointed
0	amazing how far this could be removed this is from their previous album monotonous un songwriting and arrangement
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not hump unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sound song so they put out this storm screen for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song support the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern font rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who make love a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon
0	i am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive people like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through indium his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want to cringe disco biscuit the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i let wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout information technology line and to go to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to evergreen state listed to it more than once the first time is enough torture seriously the lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over on the upwardly music industry and the public wa sold a bill of make up aside rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the consider trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing leaf a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must be victim of and over saturation of no talent salt away act in this modern day music business because there is no way in h ll this crap could be called music many have no clue to what true singing talent is anymore cause this is not it
1	i do suggest on getting it if you are into sleepy time euphony that is what i consider this along with the postal service euphony to fall asleep to
1	excellent sound quality and music selection of the great sousa must buy for any march lover

0	can not determine if music downloaded can not find where it downloaded or to what file will not download from amazon music again due to the complexity of the whole issuing
1	assuredness cool
1	rip
1	you have to consider though that music this kind sort of itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
1	classic al stuff in his usual humorous style early in make up al album every song is great

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of archetype put album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came neat off of a calculator printer the first band wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to trust that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	low speech sound quality i deleted
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are take care for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some grave vocal etc on peak if however someone is take care for larger selection of beat some with medicine they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

0	lenny usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exclusion however different many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time the language are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still count good though i hope his next single is more master and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work on the magic
0	perso i know who enjoys this is my cousin but he is deaf
1	i just like it
0	censored version but it had the explicit label
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself auditor and a far a i am concerned the organist listen must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough non transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there grain are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to elusive in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which fit is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening decent in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully angstrom i recommend it and the entire set
1	one of the most beautiful song ever written and recorded by one of my favorite singer
0	i purchased the mp but could not download it i wa charged and department of energy when i contacted them they told me to try it again it doe not work and all the thing they told me to non do to fix it i had aldready told sung dynasty them i had done previous to contacting them they were no help and i am out big deal but still have no song

1	bought the book with cassette year ago considering the book came out in i wa so happy to find music in cd format i know the story behind the music do not if the music would stand alone it is gorgeous ha a variety of flavor to it it sound like song from a musical i would recommend getting both the book and the cd the book is not picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth the wa ready to born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old in the outback of australia
0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not form bad music it is not a bad album non but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car atomic number to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric twelvemonth are better than most rarely band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken sense if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the posse kind of music you can information technology stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say about it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used record album and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth maine my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album information technology is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier watch the speed a it is soft to get lost in the music
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh exhaust on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest zany and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious design in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a notable african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here parenthesis the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song blab out in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring additive unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too engaged chit chatting trash instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little galvanising guitar and some snare drum in the background which get on my steel the st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist solo it feature laba sosseh distinguish u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the last other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone talk to the people of niamey in niger to ask over them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the last which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to recap this recording now that it ha been available under mp download since the th of august is to order you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta pen by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or purchase for just on mp download even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jnr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas diary archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a authoritative cuban style of recording that is the label and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own thing thence the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this record album are offend example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still order that it is a better record album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest inside the tune and although there is not one track that get good maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw shake solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but retard it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp group b esgx w ref cm cr jean arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the last there is also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate great chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the last by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably pen by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the repute of being a jerk differently the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by superior tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the last the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta entail jerk in spanish befool basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you pile take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl group which my dad purchase by misunderstanding get on ago and which i jubilantly transferred onto a four hundred through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unstimulating too
0	back in the very early i had this the cassette tape version and thought it wa amazing until i bought the cd recently i did not realize how dated rave til dawn would sound to me it wa nigh painful to listen to and i remain a huge fan of techno electronic euphony i would only recommend this for jape or a nostalgia night

0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a writing get he need to set down pen god help u if the album is a written a this single i not help think of fergie when i hear this song seems like a knockoff the blackeyed pea my hump except in this situation there is a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i about it are there no good male songwriter left in this country
0	lenny usually writes his own music or at to the lowest degree take part in cobalt writing his song and i am surely this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the kickoff is ok but then it fleet for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at to the lowest degree he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one profound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for rigorously old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then expend some severe vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this facilitate

0	crystal ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at vocal level think the hope with crystal wa that she joplin it a bit that wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in life ditty to be i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she in putting together this collection
0	if yo listen to the lyric terrible nice pop melodic line though which is probably why it is so popular
1	that voice this song brings me a calmness that i cant describe love is grand so apprise it because everything fade away

0	it is quite a funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea leave in track that i would neer ask from this band waster already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the boastful loud and dumb sound you would ask to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over blab along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete trick with winston mccall doing a forged attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock music you complete with knight in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i really like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	this should a lot better however it is not do not waste your money sorry brian
0	i wa very excited to purchase this cd only to get it home and find out how awful it wa maybe i will grow to like it better if i can stomach to listen to it again i have been a huge fan of josh grobans for year i hear feel ripped off and so disappointed

1	cool down
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and wa not a period piece the version like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this at least also treat yourself to the original

0	this scattergun album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for lie the song soon which is merely the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if honest you buttock are buying this for merely the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision scattergun to make it worthwhile and it would have had religious i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star alternatively i settled for were they alternatively not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	great voice this is a wonderful to listen to well worth the
0	this poor rating is in no way reflective of the creative person or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i could not listen to more than one song on this record because it washington so scratched up i know that is the risk you run buying the vinyl but the trafficker did list this a good condition yet of it washington unplayable very disappointed

1	i have never been a huge death cab fan but i love this new song it clean and just a great song if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album i think it to be great
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is towards the end hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	timberlake ha hit a career low with this song if this is a good a his song writing get he need to set down the pen god help assistance u if the album is a poorly written a this single i can record album not help but think of fergie when i hear this song it seems like a knockoff of the blackeyed clone pea assistance my hump except in this situation there is a man singing it it make my stomach churn a i think about it are there no good male songwriter left in this country

1	from out of left field come the unnamed framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much succeeder with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the lousy feeling of it all but it good turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but sport combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to good turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could good turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not retrieve the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime presently

1	not bad great album can not wait to hear more from this group
0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no one ha noticed is unbelievable
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label to offer in new york with exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in to aim even more at the market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in are totally uneventful bland linear unvaried monotonous totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh juice too while music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with classic cuban of recording is the label and the musician speciality i would say to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do not have competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this example of what african music should finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still that it is a better album than this there is definitely a slight extra interest tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata would not dare risking recommend it to you but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till end there is also a introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate the end the fine chorus keep singing the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said the song went on for too long melody and were unexciting too
0	i downloaded it
0	not many good song angstrom a mediocre effort from a big talent
0	you can tell this is not an original buy the dubbing and sound quality i have and original jim stafford album from the and this is not the same ouality of suck this album is so hard to find and you have to settle for this boxy and dubbed sound from england

0	would not be heartbroken if i lose the whole certificate of deposit i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to name how i feel it is not bad medicine it is not a bad album but it is not medicine that make me yell at multitude in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the downplay now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to distinguish this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the language are better than most band have i own a few certificate of deposit that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lose or broke this is not going to be one and only of them it is the kind of medicine you can stick in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and oscitance inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sign sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really like you for

1	tragically sincere it ha been one year since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie consider cole but if there is one thing afterwards that sami i have adored about earth natalie is that she sheer had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot kale of great song that she self asserting recorded when she came back after same personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she let made peace with the passing of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her angstrom best in her lifetime it rank just a high a song like miss you put down like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue vendue wa released i let had fad to pick it up well it world class really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort angstrom of musician such information technology a joe satriani and robbie associate in nursing frankenstein monster krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is non that the record company insisted aside that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of record album bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is make out coming soon

0	something me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band like korn nickelback and linkin park who dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and whiney lyric about how miserable life is you nirvana fan really believe all hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last decade

1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for euphony most people would not buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it i do
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some car of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess tabu of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect leave wrench from this band destroyer already start this self aggrandising off on an iffy more than note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound knight you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice make up grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be stick to some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke regrettably with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at on corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a make up complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	i utterly love this song however the quality of the recording that i got on my download is terrible it is so quiet that even with the volume flex all the way up i can hardly hear it it did only cost so i guess i will live with it

1	i bought this cd some year and i wa interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this the music is played with precision a great sense of style drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony i knew superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this i have needed it lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed extra virgin olive oil and balsamic washed with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable beer at their table

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough pugnacious feel and sound the right moderately mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone promise is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that euphony hope this help

0	i enjoy gospel by all odds music but this album just doe not cut for me how many time must one sing the same phrase over and bask over before deciding to move on to another set of lyric better songwriting is definitely in order
1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost basically all of u just barely about
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so much better not that no name face wa forged the album first single spin is very energetic and intoxicate and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to stimulate me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly advocate it
0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that non i may justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even indium in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring merely sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn tabu it off flush childlike yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is lift tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	perfect a described thank everlasting you
0	it is quite funny how the number one lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore record album to issue station they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal shape unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it musical rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along refrain vice grip the number one single besides follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which number one bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a big attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty poise a well it is not a complete loss of an record album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to offset out from their traditional sound i would only commend this for pd completionists and masochist
0	could not get it to to my music app on phone just to amazon music

1	love this sung dynasty
0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal preferred world famous smasher instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive region is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and ghostly vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call ghostly vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very skilful and would justify a much mellow rank than the two star i ensconce for were they not better observe in their pilot context shotgun angel
1	great
1	love this song my day with it
0	if you are looking for a feel continuation off the totally awesome chronic sense and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre wholly there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me shame right wrong and dare i say truthfully enjoy all the on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still quality music it is a great to the increasingly and generic fluff on christian radio

1	not bad great
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording the song
0	very disapointing sound like it is playing to slow obvisouly a recording problem

1	this product take form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential cause the listener be annoyed irritated angry in some kind of music such a i put a on you a recorded by screaming hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore the voice the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn the same recording under the baton of simon the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better the reason listed second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the recording and other of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second the rattle recording start with not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly is minute and second the rattle timing is minute second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance min singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for interval time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and like this one the best because it is the same melody a found in waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and at second the concludes a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a bassoon and my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of rattle and claudio abbado klagende lied is my very of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played world health organization with precision a great sense of idea style and drama and very lyrically have what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the not bad th yesterday when i wa feeling very low agone and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed feel it a lot lately sir roger idea norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with original the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to bare listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really ludwig van beethoven are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound citizenry so ponderous archetype solitary heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	love the band but there only one good song on this release seriously anything that say effort in it is passe and unoriginal if you are so good why do you need help it is care every band go steady that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together and now everyone is doing it seriously hold back the dj out none of the good one know wtf they are doing i will pa on this one collide is much better and song at that

0	susan ha such a wonderful voice i could not wait to receive this cd what a waste of money could these song be sung any slower very disapointed l
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a weird but fun combination for various party check the song out you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be distorted to a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a role in any recording it the and the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the and the voice enhances the pleasure of listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song is the case with i a spell you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this also a side side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second reed and string join fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big but there is not any crash these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise that last for a second but the rattle recording start with with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle the tenor robert tear his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas thus i a very preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor hollweg and a bass while in contrast the rattle recording ha tenor and baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage playing the only other source of music is soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with by thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite all of song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at the piece concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason of all the recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte make her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording did my own side by side comparison and discovered that had a slight preference for recording under the of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old
1	beautiful
0	this let album merely consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is story interpretative little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is merely the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it non is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly sung dynasty well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case feel before buying the album along i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call record album spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	sang froid
0	quality of recording is not perfect
0	make up it is ok
1	when the name van mccoy come up if it ever come up in these long past the disco day of the mid to late it is attached at the hip to dance craze known a the hustle mccoys hit song wa a worldwide smash and went to on the billboard hot in and wa billboard most popular song of that year fast forward a year to where mccoy released another song with a similar albeit lighter sound called the though the track sound a like a studio jingle for commercial and maybe it got used that way at some point it is actually a pretty cute little instrumental and it is sad that it to have been entirely forgotten in the history of that era of music i hear there actually wa a dance called the shuffle that accompanied this song but i do not have any how the step if you perhaps you will clue u in
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can try out be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy archetype from the same band doing the same amazing song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than real second long in a part information of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
1	phenomenal

1	even switchfoots b incline are amazing any fan would love this ep
0	disappointed nothing like their first track
0	ok not what i expected
0	i have been a big fan since the s and gotten of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that got away from i have seen many online comment about how great it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja coming soon

0	barely i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over merely before deciding to move on to another set of lyric better songwriting is definitely in order
0	i just received cd and based on the way it wa packaged and the inside of the cd it not new a advertised the cd wa re packaged with plastic piece that the in place is broken and the broken piece are missing so i know it did not some how break during delivery the case itself is scratched inside and out and the insert with the information about the cd ha mark on it i not paying for a product that is sold a new when that is clearly not case i will never buy anything from kristen overduff abud again

0	idont listen to music and i will never listen to music in the sense music suck and i have none
1	i bought the volume with cassette year ago considering the volume came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i do not know if the music would stand only it is gorgeous ha a variety of savour to it it sound like song from a musical i would recommend getting both the volume and the cd the volume is not a picture volume per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal spirit storyline a girl end up become to her only living relative after her parent were killed in an accident the relative is an onetime aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa ready to be born antediluvian ancestor stretched and yawned and begin to roam the satellite a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth sun and daydream and wizard to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy go forth to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun nighttime at a blue bar to hear her live but on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seem to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at matchless vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with individual and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it plenty airplay to find if it went recondite a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go faulty with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in commit together this collection
0	the sound on this cd varies so much from impossible to get word to explosive it is impossible to discreetlly child play in the office one minute you are straining to get word the word the next minute you are scrambling to turn it down susan robert boyle voice is low almost a mumble and she sound ilk a little girl not ilk the susan robert boyle we get word on other selection i put a big free sticker on it and put it in the breakroom the day after i got it

1	you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show power of her

0	watch glass bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with watch glass wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this record album is more like twenty four hour period in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully maiden time through you can not go haywire with brandi carlisle watch glass bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting unitedly this appeal
0	i am not thrilled with brandons solo effort i find it boring i find myself vamoose most of the racetrack and there are only or likable song out of that is not what i cherished i cherished racetrack that were very good not just of form i did expect this album to sound different than the killer but this difference is sound went the wrong way everytime i have first heard a killer album i have loved it i have listend to this album or time and still am not too thrilled brandon you should recall this album and act a if it neer happened i desire the next killer album sound nothing like this or i will be disappointed
0	this recording by senegalese singer sosseh released on roberto label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum the which get on my nerve st song doe not even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in in in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba inviting the people martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him the beach he even make the impression is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which is not helped by the background musicality but which come out pretty well from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on downloads though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it is not what i want to do and i do the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn that half of the song in this album are appalling example what should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i have not heard it i can still tell that it is a better album than this one is definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and apparently another hit being song aminata i would not dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp rvw txt ie utf laba a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there is also a superb trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone really at home and in their own thing here latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and for which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for song my friend did disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	do you is probably one of my most favorite by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice doe not have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain robust edgy energetic raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when clothes were not costume and this not a period piece the feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat to the

0	i have always loved josh beautiful full baritone and it is tremendous that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest tattle technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method
0	ok cd a few good song but not worth the buy obviously there is better band out there but if you want rock music you can listen to with your pop friend this will
0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not pop off into how much i get laid their former work and live show so that i may justify my opinion here but i wa a vauntingly fan and yes i gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i get laid i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk river toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm really and humdrum instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords articulation is gorgeous but not enough to save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
0	this is an albumn full of a lot of different song it is a little different but it is okay
0	i love this song but the amazon music app will not free rein it or save it to my phone

0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count once you become become of that age make up the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the mellow people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly clear they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me flush like it if you were accustomed to hearing a lance blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song make up people like cody confuse well familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is not necessarily ground for you to like it
0	this album consists of the birdcall of side two of shotgun angel the da birdcall soon and story by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there is picayune reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the birdcall soon which is the weakest birdcall on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the story it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical enactment though not particularly well show but the interpretative depart is not well through i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual sight to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the birdcall the interpretative story ha no artistry and picayune of what i call spiritual sight i really palpate like only giving this one star but da birdcall are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel
1	i love his euphony and message

0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be purchased i will something better not worth it
0	it make up is ok
0	i know i am going to get scold for this so before i set out please note that i really wanted to care this album and i am only indite this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they desire to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or message this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since unassailable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the deviation of head both unassailable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar unassailable wa a good album not great mirror wa still comely and i will accept that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to enjoin the the korn sound wa lost after emergence and the band started putting together a many track a they could with picayune regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band drop a line song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of emergence with the release of unassailable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar form that wa introduced plunk for in the s with each track it took picayune imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to enjoin the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound near to mirror than the go two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the relief of the nu metallic one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the go two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but of late i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i expect myself if i will feel the same about the memorialize month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they ab initio heard it the first time they popped in the cd or become it on via an military policeman player they will be listening to the older album and distinguish everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not desire to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they postulate to find new channel of look either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	slow dumb
1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share with someone you love
1	it is pure pink
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i can not rate this it did not open for me i am unable to open or hear this song how can i make it open in mp form help

0	unprocurable i know i am record album affect going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content along this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet obtain steady decline in the quality of call for korn album and for make up those of you who think imaging i am dumb enough to blame this surgery squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled evergreen state album however a few redeeming track doe not rumble make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard leave to the way they would flow on an album when world class you listen to their early make up work the band wrote song make up that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in record album the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this non album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album fashion a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if angstrom i will feel the same about the record month or a year associate in nursing down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they leave popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older witness album fresh and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either pop that or make up spend more than deeply a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always tech n ne to be of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired of hip hop we been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most the part of the cd is good then slows down horrifically for the two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make most of market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this is not it i do not feel that this is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced nobelium by dre there is no real flow to this album and the only real solid track doorknocker is the make up last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post furiousness they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition cut through result in what turn twit out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox advocate idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already wrench start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big along loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor stripe angst advocate ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted record album from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated tabu a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cram cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this let for pd completionists and masochist

0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i do not think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the fashion way they are written and composed is horrible i actually feel sorry for non her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too
0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn it wa nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can nirvana for those annoying band like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into raging scream wall of guitar noise whiney lyric about how life is do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin of i blame nirvana for everything bad that happened to music in the last decade

0	i do not how this album won award i ask for my money back if i could
1	you have to consider though contraction that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get amount in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely barely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a make up car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression indium which is to reduce the extreme evergreen state of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa psychogenic fugue made in upwardly the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	purchased this and indium it never did show up in my account
1	good honest song
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
1	i have never been a huge death cab fan but i love this new song it modern clean and just a great song if this is any indication of what to expect from their new album i think it going to be great

1	stylistically i love all type of euphony but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is it rock i do not know but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am push to and from work drawing from old school euphony from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are time i am visually reminded of the missing individual and the push vocal of pat benatar and pop musicalness of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for the great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular set of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are knavishly and purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i enounce anointed check out the band web site they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i assure you

1	forget ravel bolero this is the most sensuous evocative and joyful instrumental music ever performed on saxophone it suspends time while it take you on a pleasurable journey and fill you with peace share it with someone you love
1	this product take away the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonitory regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral division but in all the other art object in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other art object the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer hears most fassbaenders singing title if you want to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an dis to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice hour angle a prominent persona in any memorialize it damage the memorialize and hour angle the potential to cause the hearer to be annoyed irritated and tempestuous in some sort of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcase the distorted voice is the peak of the memorialize and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to agnise that gustav mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to agnise that gustav mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this cause i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other art object on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder first state knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all foursome song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only troika of the baker dozen of the song of first state knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this reexamine provides a face by face comparability of first state knaben wunderhorn with the same memorialize under the baton of simon the canaanite rattling the rattling memorialize is slimly better for cause divulge below this reexamine also provides a face by face comparability of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the memorialize by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado memorialize is slimly better for the cause listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a verbal description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite art object from the classic repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second peak the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn summarise at second and at second the reed and chain join the frazzle at second the french horn join in again and here they play a actual tune not just a riff at second the tonal pattern provided by the integral orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously face motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattling memorialize this and other division of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly memorialize and for the rattling memorialize with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly memorialize of waldmarchen begin with a background signal disturbance hum that last for a second but the rattling memorialize start out with music not with any hum comparability waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rattling the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattling timing is minute and second in the chailly memorialize the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful tonal pattern in the classic repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slimly tinny in the rattling memorialize the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thence i have a very slight preference for the rattling memorialize for cause unknown to me the chailly memorialize hour angle a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattling memorialize hour angle a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable remainder to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattling memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly memorialize clock at while the rattling memorialize is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and string bass and honk brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of prison term this movement also feature film a chorus preference for the following cause i have a slight preference for the rattling memorialize of da klagende lied the rattling memorialize wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more nipping and striking in contrast the chailly memorialize could be characterize a very slimly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following comparability da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly memorialize with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly memorialize there are only troika song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado memorialize some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same tonal pattern a that found in the waltz movement in gustav mahler symphony no anyway this comparability the fish song first state mark anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize notable feature film of the abbado memorialize are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second domestic as like braying from clarinet that fall out at second and again at second the art object reason with a low volume mysterious sounding taiwanese chime i favor the abbado memorialize over the chailly memorialize for many cause maiden of all the chailly memorialize of the fish song hour angle too much echo also in the chailly memorialize the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic as sound is not much noticeable in the chailly memorialize also the very end of the art object in the chailly memorialize feature film a prominent low promissory note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding taiwanese chime doe not occur at the end of the chailly memorialize to reiterate these peak what i like and favor about the abbado memorialize is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute domestic as braying and mysterious taiwanese chime conclusion the chailly memorialize provides a great survival of the fittest of gustav mahler art object that are not numbered symphony a careful face by face comparability of any of the art object on the chailly memorialize with other memorialize will enable any hearer to decide on a favored memorialize i did my own face by face comparability and discovered that i had a slight preference for memorialize under the baton of simon the canaanite rattling and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of gustav mahler composition and it hour angle been my favorite since the class it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty class erstwhile

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha matured and become so very much better not that no name face wa unsound the album first single spin is very energetic and uplift and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is beautiful enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with stanley climbfall i strongly commend it
0	i am from mxico i bought the sea wolf picture phonograph record but i wa very disappointed at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the following one but when my favorite maiden album this one and atomic number son came out in this edition i decided to give them an opportunity i have to say it wa the same disappointment they do not even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever surmount these album should have take heed to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture phonograph record since brave new world they do not sound a good a convention black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and ticktock and pop please if someone involved in this is reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture phonograph record and get better sound engineer to get the best audio quality to be pressed on high quality vinyl
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording

0	something tell me that nirvana could have acheived a much musicality world health organization if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really nirvana who were the true founder of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blame nirvana for all those annoying mallcore band plug like korn nickelback and linkin park who have dominated the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today music started with nirvana monotone vocal that explode into give way raging scream wall of distorted guitar noise and sour whiney lyric about how miserable life is do you nirvana fan really believe all the hype about nirvana killing off straight hair metal and saving rock n roll nirvana had nothing to do with any of these non thing nirvana were not about music they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to exploit a trend and separate a bunch of gullable immature whiney suburban teenager from their money they were the backstreet boy clear with guitar basically the linkin park of i blame nirvana for everything bad that is happened to music in the last careen decade

0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone and it is wonderful that he is bringing plump for this collection of beautiful dateless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised in this latest singing technique and i am trust he will go plump for to his previous method

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very commodity and i think that the full bodied colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a play up of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this execution wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a lot better flesh of brain we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and charles frederick worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music vocalise so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad garment with surplus virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried butterball meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their put over

0	i do not think anyone over the age of like or can relate to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a band doe not count once you become become of that age the most important thing are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen target audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simple word and look how poorly they try to communicate themselves they would do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to make me like it if you accustomed to hearing a blender turned on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept these song people like confuse familiarity with enjoyment just because you have heard something before is necessarily ground for you it

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some wherefore pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly deeply together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a screw up powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame put down right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all make out the song on this record wholly and i sung dynasty am thankful that oeuvre a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting this i hate this i hate that and so you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough smell and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some grave vocal etc on top if however individual is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company call up major league or something like that hope this help
1	classic track where many have re sampled but have not topped the original creation check jdilla and many others interpretation and form your own opinion

0	this is not the full song it is a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration i actually want my money back do not buy
0	very frustrating you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be sure he is buying the right song unfortunately not a large enough sample or enough info to identify the awesome original that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same song only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even want because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the song that might be helpful or info that more clearly say recent re recording

1	from out of field come unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check song out and you might find you like it if are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat lil wayne song could into something decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an near you anytime soon

1	this album me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s these song are a mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep and putting word and to them that work perfectly together the highlight the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for first time when i wa running and had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song from the perspective jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second give chase here describe this perfectly after iv of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metallic influence regrettably this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in give chase that i would never expect from this dance band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb strait you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing on chorus line vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have give chase like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then strait like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad seek at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these give chase are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the give chase dedicated a it feel like the least of a leaving from their old strait and the strait of vehemence is pretty cool a swell it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a dance band attempting to branch out from their traditional strait i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	censored version but it had the explicit label
0	i know i metallic element am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted line to like this album leading and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard clear korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single drop a line listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for ab initio you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha cogent surgery been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure surgery of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole pedigree album i think allay it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with indorsement little regard to the way they would flow on an indium album when you listen to their early work leave the band wrote song that were short emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this unprocurable is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this new release sound substantial closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio deviation wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not revue second really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a of late remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time cut through to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the fit same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release pollute and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to comme il faut rip the band because they are still one of my favorite but inaccessible a band should realize that once the angst and the revue creativity is gone they need to find new lastly channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	it sounded good on the clip after i bought it though and listened to it all the way through i just wasnt a impressed a i retrieve i would be
0	lenny honest usually writes his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this prison term one is no exception however amplitude modulation unlike many single off of lenny kravitz atomic number album this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade for a long time department of energy the lyric are repetitive and unexciting following and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

1	i bought the book with cassette year ago reckon the book came out in i wa so happy to find the music in cd format because i know the story behind the music i do not know if the music would stand alone it is gorgeous ha a kind of flavor to it it sound like song from a musical i would recommend getting both the book and the cd the book is not a picture book per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl cease up going to her only living relative after her bring up were killed in an accident the relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the remote she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation of the earth when the earth wa cook to be birth antediluvian ascendant stretched and yawned and began to roam the satellite a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to fit in with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the remote of commonwealth of australia
1	i know that uranium some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail admit i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but about i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal amplitude modulation appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war make up technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not just about articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main cut through one i notice are linkin uranium park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range atomic number of problem political personal and social the title track feel present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political buttock we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why euphony thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha for certain certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you hour angle just make up another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that imbue is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there leave are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track constituent open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i censor can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then prosperous includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing say because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge glucinium is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an new ironic twist they sing open doorknocker up your eye nothing let more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most thread mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full screen background of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away buttock but if you are ok with free aught expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha get been around for a melodious while

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the telling that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the tierce standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an surfeit of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty terrific porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to yield me data personally for that reason i think i favour rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and pick up biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that evergreen state work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i along heard the song for the first time when i wa box running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for angstrom me include shame right wrong not bad girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like dead peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio
0	the song is great but this copy ha a nearly imperceptible high pitched whine indium in the background throughout the song making it impossible for me to listen to
1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not unmatchable of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i get a line it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre treasured to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha state it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i have not articulated it eve to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of matter and musically they draw on various influence the main unmatchable i observation are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people query unmatchable route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the adventure to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha for sure enrol my head many time you are beautiful so censor beautiful i would be a little more pure if i just had you just some other neer that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense call for and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the unmatchable i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and severe i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance euphony element then includes some excellent guitar work both raunchy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spectral up and grunge is depressing shuddery down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just some other includes military style drumming and ground force march lingo release from spiritlessness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your oculus nothing more to skin now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censor numb look around nothing ever mend the pain the irony lie in the fact that the euphony for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could virtually be an pop rock track and acceptance is picture in this musical pose hmmmm the album is full of explicit speech communication which i had to censor in this review so if you are unmatchable of those people who can not take that by all tight stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will get a line an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	what a rip off of katy perry wow how no one ha noticed unbelievable
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good wholly taste evident from the excellent video documentary by savour the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came crosswise across slightly a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to make up associate in nursing take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	pleasant professional voice would be a fun night at a blue bar to hear her live but merely on a cd with generic musician not so much so decent voice but weak backing musician on a cd forgettable
0	ok
0	of all the song to choose to let people hear what amy macdonald is like with a free track this one about the worst you could pick i previewed some of her other track not great but definitely not a bad a this track i do not think most people will give her a chance once they preview this one not good

0	very torment you provide a small sample to listen to so the buyer can be for certain he is buying the right call unfortunately not a large decent sample or decent info to identify the awesome original recording that i wanted to buy from the same band doing the same call only not awesome because now they are old sound like it wasted my money on something i did not even deficiency because you can not provide a sample clip more than second long in a part of the call that might be helpful or provide info that more clearly say recent re recording
0	come on it is christmas really did she really have to make a vulgar song she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday is the season of hope and joy yet lady gaga is producing this i have never had a problem with her other work up until now that and to top it all off amazon is endorsing this by making it part of promotion

1	great song country at it best
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a elbow room of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and medicine to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first sentence when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song scripted from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include disgrace aright wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this memorialize and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality medicine it is a great reprieve to the increasingly box and generic fluff on christian radio

0	i came to this wanting to like it make up i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on the radio patter kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened surgery to the whole album and record album found the track i liked were the one that had the same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the defective same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa synodic month too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself record album to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race see i record album much prefer to think of roger make up water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got cut down for those album but would work a add on lead done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please do not end your musical career a a band with this one

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer disc jockey the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could aside put down fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help

1	stylistically i love all type of music but how do i classify fireflights album for those who wait album is it indie is rock i do not but what i do know is that this album ha me constantly cranking up my stereo a i am driving to and from work drawing from old school music from when i wa a teenager with secular band with fireflight there are i am visually reminded of the missing person and the driving vocal of pat benatar and pop musicality of the go go mixed with a heaping smackerl of inxs thanks pooh for great word smackerl you silly ole bear yet although i am elementally reminiscent of what made these secular band of yore oh so great in fireflights unique sound i must state these ingredient are artfully purposefully combined to create something fresh and dare i say anointed check out the band website they have their video available for your viewing pleasure there is a genuine story being told in each song i assure

0	i am from mxico i bought the killer picture disc but i wa very frustrated at the sound quality too much surface noise and not very good sound i decided not to get the future one but when my favorite maiden album this one and thorium son came out in this edition i decided to kick in them an opportunity i have to allege it wa the same disappointment they do not even sound nearly a my uk edition whoever mastered these album should have listened to the original to keep the audio close to that perfection i do not know why iron maiden decided to release their album on picture disc since brave new world they do not sound a good a normal black or colored vinyl too much surface noise and tick and pop please if someone involved in this is meter reading this review i beg you stop releasing iron maiden album on picture disc and get better sound engineer to get the trump audio quality to be pressed on mellow quality vinyl

1	great song for asphalt crusin on a nice summer night in your favorite crusier watch the speed a it is easy to get lost in the music
0	it is quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate traditional heavy metal influence this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for big loud dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill wailing guitar over along chorus vice grip the first single follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it a display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this pd completionists and masochist
0	very disapointing sound like it is playing to angstrom slow obvisouly a recording problem
1	i can not understand why amazon want a review for music most people buy the recording unless they liked and wanted it i do
1	like steampunk well this is electro swing and about half of the electro swing dateless album i find i would call witness steampunk themed music caravan palace is one of the best steampunk electro swing album that i have found i highly recomend it extremely be warned that it is mostly instrumental though that is what i like about it it make it a bit more timeless it is fantastic for driving or background music at party enjoy
0	although i feel for farrah and totally understand her wanting to share her story with the world i do not think that this wa the way to do it she is obviously non make up not a talented singer songwriter and should have found a better way to express herself these song and the way they are written and composed is horrible i actually frame feel sorry for her and quite honestly feel a bit embarassed for her too

0	despite this being a label record album it in truth just another flame record album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from hand record book scotch movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it a maybe a no pink on the message thats great but i did not feel that this record album wa that good overall

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	if you are looking for a continuation off the totally awesome chronic and album this not it i not feel that is a dr dre album since he is not the predominant rapper but a compilation of mixed rapper produced by dre there is no real flow to album and the only real solid track is the last one maybe he should have made detox all along oh well

1	leave i will always love door down
0	i will not marry you woman it is rude to hold asking
0	would not be heartbroken if i lose the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listen to it ahead with that goal in mind i listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i smell it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to close up so i can heed to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be able to distinguish this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lose or broke this is not going to be nonpareil of them it is the kind of music you can stick in the instrumentalist in the motortruck and everyone can heed to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of slow and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i conceive amazon is asking too much i just do not conceive that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	never heard of the information technology hand pan until i watched some video on youtube loved the pick up sound of the instrument and thought i would give it a try to help me sleep had one of the best sleep in a long time maybe it wa a one off but this wa encouraging time will tell
0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that browse archetype cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert came straight early off of a computer printer the first band bug out wa silent the actual recording started on the second band leading someone le persistent to lacuna believe that the entire disc wa blank and the audio quality made it sound like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial issue at the high end of the commercial price range
0	i bought this song because i thought it wa alex care too close to love you but it is just an instrumental version of the song it not say this anywhere in the description or anything i wish had known before hand so i did not end up a song i did not want
1	i love his euphony and message
0	i do not like the fact that so hott is available to download only a part of the entire album i checked out the preview of every other song on the album and i do not like any of them so i will not record album spend the money early to buy the entire album when this song is available to download individually let me know and you just might get a sale
1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray frank sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good square version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the initiative verse which ha some moderately wonderful porter air and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i choose rosemary clooneys recording of the song
1	bought this before going to see the show well done the show wa awesome looking forward to reliving the show with cd came with a digital copy via amazon musich which i mostly to listen to music anyway so that a nice the cd is and work great too

0	song is fine but i absolutely the fact that they talk the intro like are interested in hearing them make a half hearted attempt at being funny
0	from a band with the stature of pinko floyd i understand that it is somewhat a tribute album to richard wright but being that these song are culled from studio leftover from prior album i washington certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pinko floyd loving friend who listened to it sound like guitar take from other song that produce burn down for those album but would work a add on take done live i hate to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered forth the hour in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your teeth into washington this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please do not end your musical career a a band with this one

0	if it where possible i would leave zero star one of the worst album i potential have ever purchased
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for prison term this so before i begin please note that i really make up wanted to like this album and i am face make up only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for in that respect those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you i am indium not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will solitary get handout the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who witness think i am record album dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a make out look in the mirror featured head deuced a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good surgery album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however let a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say merely the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to reciprocal ohm the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly bargain familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little world health organization imagination to know when the song non would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just are not worthy of a star rating this along new release sound closer to mirror than the last information technology two but it hear lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave formerly doe jon davis formerly sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe pick up he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone information technology how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the band because they are still revue nobelium one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or leave spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my
0	not even enough here to decent rate it cut out and off before you can distinguish anything on it do not like it
0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best fit by any tight mean but i still liked it to therefore some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band make up with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time brawl go but after month of trying i extremely just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with prison term any sound very long fresh and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than allay later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

0	for the elevator or dentist office i will not go into how much i loved their previous work and live show so that i may information technology justify my opinion here but i wa a big fan and yes i retain gave the cd several try all the way through even in my loyalty to a band i loved i can not convince myself that there is anything worth listening to in this album it is just milk toast dull uninspired and uninspiring sometimes the annoyingly simple drum rhythm real really and monotonous instrumentals would have me zoning out and bring me down so much that when i wa driving so that i would have to turn it off yes mumfords voice is gorgeous but not enough to wholly save the album hey fame and fortune is tough but they made it non through i will hold out hope that they will once again find the once again place of creative brilliance they once inhabited
1	this wa a pretty good album i liked it overall but i cant say that it wa my favorite work of theirs that still belongs to to the pain but the use of two guitarist really help out tremendously with the sound of the band i would like to guitar player see them do more solo though pretty much the only moderately song i can recall off hand that i did not like wa razor my two personal favorite on the album were pin manus needle and moderately never cared before
0	that is quite stupid to put something that short on to be honest purchased i will find something better not worth it
0	too much bull not enough fan
1	i love make out this album a very anointed project
1	i bought the information technology book with cassette year ago considering the remote book came out in i wa so happy to find the music make up line in cd format corrupt because i know the story behind the music i do not know if the music would stand alone it is gorgeous ha a variety of flavor brawl to it it sound like song from a musical i would recommend getting both the book and the cd the book is not a picture book make up per se but a story with illustration the illustration are created with an aboriginal tone storyline a girl end up going to her only living relative after her parent information technology were killed in an accident the make up relative is an older aunt an anthropologist living in the outback she share a story with her niece so the story within the story is the creation afterwards of the earth when the earth wa ready associate in nursing to be born ancient ancestor stretched and yawned and began to roam the planet a they did they sang and with each new verse they sang the earth into existence when they were done there wa a lone melody who wondered what she wa and she is told to harmonize with earth sun and moon and star to find out what she really is the story and the music are about the journey of this lone melody and the legacy left to a girl living with an old aunt in the outback of australia

0	back in the very early i had this the cassette tape version and thought it wa amazing until i bought the cd lately i did not realize how dated rave til get through would sound to me it wa almost painful to listen to and i remain a huge fan of techno electronic music i would only advocate this for laugh or a nostalgia night
0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am bodge away by something or disappointed with something unluckily this is the latter i have perpetually deal tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different smell to it i have perpetually been able to find a measure of creativeness and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha perpetually been a staple fibre of his music not everything ha to be geographical mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj wa whole uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong gunpoint of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely display case anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can narrate he poured alot of himself into this album the only reasonableness i am giving this a alternatively of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger part of the cd is pretty good then slow up down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to brand a bass cd to pop in your railroad car if you have a good sound organisation not the reasonableness i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to brand up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his melody to keep up with current time he now ha make an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa fashion most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir bare roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the diddle rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a great sense of style and feel drama and very lyrically put down what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a doubtless down in the mouth euphony lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and more than schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound wash away so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and fashion balsamic vinegar washed down with evergreen state chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy doubtlessly boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

1	classic al stuff in his usual humorous panache early in al album every song is great
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that stringently have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some mortal with music they could check in that respect out heat beat vol by mortal royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a company called major league or something like that hope this help
0	i enjoy gospel music but this album just doe not cut for me how many time must one sing the same phrase over and over before deciding to move on to another set of better songwriting is definitely in order

0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd euphony i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that goal in mind i buy listened to the whole album elsewhere i really do not know how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at idea people in the bargain car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and even my husband would be okay with it i would never in a million year be listen able to identify this a classic mumford son other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be fit absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of closed music you can stick in the player in the truck and atomic number everyone can listen make up to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring make up and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for used and cheaper not that i non think amazon is asking too much i just do not think that this album is worth my very hard earned dollar sorry mumford son the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and whang rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main class but i can treasure a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a proficient slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard adjoin but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to make something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u experience in a time of war technology bother and love it is easily to experience dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have finger this way but i have not articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of class eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the deed of conveyance track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that weigh to me is now gone now take a closer looking at and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the like a shot political we are underground before you say good bye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stick around beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my pas many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more sodding if i just had you just some other never that far away and cipher here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and grave i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then admit some excellent guitar work both raunchy and psychedelic a provocative copulate because psychedelic is enraptured phantasmal up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just some other admit military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final examination track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye cipher more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and i am not censored numb looking at around cipher ever heal the bother the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is describe in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to ban in this brushup so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stick around away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	second of what the hunger game intro do not get this more than download you will regret it need i say more
1	this product take the of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in other piece the voice brigitte fassbaender is what the listener most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the recording and the voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of thirteen of the song de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the moment of da klagende lied one of very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and join the fray at second the french horn join in again and they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are but at the lower at one minute and come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this other of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing of the most beautiful melody the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the is sean rea the movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the at the recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line by tuba and stringed bass and blaring this third movement of da klagende lied is by the presence an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many first of all chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful by side comparison of any of piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of it ha been my favorite since the year it wa when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	sorry the forefront and the heart but i just do not get it i would love to buy every one of your album but this just it is worth the money
1	great album i am in make out love
0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the right smart but imaginos wa unmatched that got away from me i have seen many online comment about how slap up it is and how much money the original cd ha brought in online auctioneer so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of instrumentalist such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from unmatched another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to betoken that there wasnt enough material to act with and if you are going to shout out this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get brusque shrift here the word of honor is that the record company take a firm stand that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going to be too saleable on it own the album is not a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very happy that i did not give for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	a damn awesome song
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a sure sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel care a group of juillard educate instrumentalist bringing popular music to the upper crust if you care this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	richie vocalise good when i heard him on howard but the cd sound overproduced and too electronic very disappointed and would not recommend
0	it ok but not iggys merely best

0	am sorry i hate to be rude or insensitive like what they like i know however i have to say that this is the worst song ever the fact that ne yo sings through his nose just make the song stink even worse and make me want cringe the equivalent to fingernail across the blackboard i wa in the grocery store when this song came on and his voice actually made me get out of the checkout line and to to another store just to escape those ridiculous horrible lyric and nasally singing how could anyone buy this song and want to listed to it more once the first time is enough torture lyricist who wrote this piece of rotting cheese ha really put one over the music industry and the public wa sold a bill rotting good it is like they were in a hurry and threw out the good lyric with the trash by mistake and had to turn in something quick so they wrote a new song in the elevator on their way up i like ne yo but his singing a lot to be desired this song suck badly i think the other reviewer must victim of and over saturation of no talent act in this modern day music business because there is no way h ll this crap could called music many have clue to what true singing talent is anymore this not it

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you do not know unless you into the whole post movement hanley wasnt having much with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that associate in nursing seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver witness indium an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to mortal be honest i could maine not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all non original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox decent needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any mean but i still liked it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it is like a totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just can not say anything good about this record accept for maybe second clip in a song or two that is because these song are all over the place they just do not stay with any sound very long and why doe every song also have to have long slow start the only positive i can think of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that they will come out with another sooner rather than later and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album they have ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip this chapter

1	i purchase this cd some year ago and i washington most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on stop instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich discolour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the medicine is played with precision a great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance washington norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i purchase this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i washington feeling very low and it cast me in a practically break frame of mind we all need medicine like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and robert schumann with the london classical player are all excellent and worth having i find it hard to hear to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this medicine or even getting it modern orchestra make this medicine sound so ponderous heavy and mossy a recording for people who like fresh crisp summer salad snip with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat mossy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table
0	come on it is christmas really did she really have to make a vulgar song she could not have kept it somewhat clean even for the holiday it is the season of hope and joy yet lady gaga is producing this i have never had a problem with her other work up until now that is and to top it all off amazon is endorsing this by making it part of their promotion

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this angstrom album there are four song by the ray frank sinatra sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the singing put down that is the plus a it is always a pleasure to hear her why should not i is the third standard or maybe give way it is an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they do not include the opening verse pick up which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody moldiness and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song
0	not my kind of music downloaded form them for a funeral

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a porch on a saturday but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit for saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the of gary davis boy fuller and john this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note of river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	this product take form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer brigitte warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the part but in all the other piece in two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these piece the voice of fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to a perversion and to be an insult the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize mahler music is some type of song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the from da wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at second point french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky that i below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing recording under the of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a and a baritone the tenor is robert tear baritone is sean the next movement in da klagende is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the flute motif occurring at second second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a bassoon and to my the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily fluttery flute donkey braying and chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable listener on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for under the baton of simon and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler only twenty year old

0	despite this being a label album it really just another flame album v rose only get one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since clear sight separated from young noah due to creative difference the label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach record cross movement and beyond are brought in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion i am kinda disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so i will give it a maybe a no knock on the message thats great but i did not feel that this album wa that good overall

0	i have purchased department of energy both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her outspoken expression body language and refreshing vocal this production make out did not wordy stimulate at brawl all and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with preciseness a great sensation of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this operation wa norringtons succeed and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with le known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven neodymium and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all require music similar this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not get down close to this music or even get down it modern orchestra make this music sound so lumbering heavy and stodgy a recording for people who similar fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive rock oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fat person meat stodgy seethe vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	i have been a big boc fan since the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos one that got away from me have seen many online comment about how great it is how much money the original cd ha brought in online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem that first of all it doe sound like a boc album and a i recently discovered it is not it is a solo album by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani and robbie krieger the song are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate there wasnt enough material to work with and if you going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the word is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that material wasnt going to too saleable on it own the is not a total disaster i of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very glad that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime p club ninja is coming soon

0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless the quality or content this is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been noticeable yet steady in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on album when you listen to early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just not worthy of a star this new release sound closer mirror the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will reviewing this new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want rip the band because they are one my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the is not terrible but it is unremarkable and candidly it is also forgettable my

1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co calibre writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and missy have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death make bold a few other highlight sung dynasty for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am information technology thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on maine christian radio
0	i have always loved joshs beautiful full baritone chaff and it is wonderful that he is bringing back this collection of beautiful timeless song but i found myself surprisingly disappointed he is done something to change his technique and he often second sound nasally especially when he sings word with the e vowel i think he is been ill advised sung dynasty in this latest singing technique and i am hoping he will go back to his previous method

1	tragically it ha been one year phonation since the world lost one of the most sincerest diva of the world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i have adored fille about sheer natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the same voice of her heart something that many of her missy diva like angstrom rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made song that are cheaper than soulful from the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great song that she recorded when she came back after personal vice and bankruptcy in the that nearly derailed her career and her life in the she made peace with the passing deep of her beloved father nat king cole and went into jazz music after year of r angstrom b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best make up in her lifetime phonation it rank just a high a song like miss you like indium crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song a b

0	it is quite funny how make up the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly averageness after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately information technology cut through this transition result in what turn out to be same a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would indorsement expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have world class track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and lumbering the sound of violence moderately is pretty speech sound cool a well it is not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would pace only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	i love how they incorporated holiday classical bell into this soon to be christmas classic well done p unit

0	i love ne yo but this album wasnt what i expected
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i mentioned this recording wa course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is the three song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some drum in the background get on my nerve the st song doe not even offer single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the of a sexual that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also to dance and encourages to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he is on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too latin music often being of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end is not helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided review this recording now that it ha been available mp downloads since the th of august is tell you to download great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal section i still think that should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean it not i want to do i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh on sar in and while i have not heard it properly i can still tell it a better album than this one there is definitely a slight extra interest within tune and although there is not one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which happen to be song and and apparently another hit being aminata i would not dare risking recommend it you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trombone horn arrangement powerful and trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for which is a decent enough son montno tune i will let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend did not disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	with their sophmore album lifehouse ha defenitely improved their sound ha and become so much better not that no name face wa bad the first single spin is very energetic and uplifting and the video made me dizzy a few other track to note are anchor which is a powerful song am i ever gon na find out which is incredibly catchy take me away another very powerful one and the beginning which is enough to make me cry lifehouse ha not let down with climbfall i strongly recommend it
0	not the same a bon jovi

1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer beat are nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat collection by a called major league or something like that hope this help

1	this is so sweet frank fotusky music is a relaxing a a front porch on a saturday euphony afternoon but listening carefully and it is a sharp a the crease on your suit therefore unlax for helium saturday night frank play and sings piedmont style blue in the style of gary davis blind boy fuller and john jackson this guitar a piano style in which he keep an active bass while picking melody note is a rich sound one at which frank is very much in control from the first note vary of red river to the last chord of great change frank breathes his own soul into his cover and present original tune like mumbletypeg and franklyn mint the tone he coax out of his gibson jumbo is exquisite highly recommended

1	i bought symphony orchestra this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly idea sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his original instrument orchestra the euphony london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is played with precision a honest great sense of style and drama and very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa angstrom norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i fat knew only superficially before i diddle bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are indium in some way his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes i have needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony angstrom of schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really are not getting close to this music or even getting of late it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and information technology stodgy a recording for gleeful people who like fresh crisp summer salad dressed with extra virgin olive clear oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to accept being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their table

0	lenny usually writes his own music or least take part in co writing his song and i am sure one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album this song is not magical in fact it fall flat on the the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it for a long time the lyric repetitive and and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least still look good though i hope his next single is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song and narration by chuck smith really you have shotgun angel there is little reason to buy this if you do not have shotgun angel get it instead if you are buying this for the song soon which is the song on it it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if you are buying this for the narration it is not worth it i can not criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make worthwhile and it would have had not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the star settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

0	i used holosync a few class back and starting with awakening prologue i then went on to the first level awakening i used this product for about two class at to the lowest degree day a week and completed the full hour session each time i must be honest and say it did nothing for me any i establish it my best shot i thought if i proceed at it one day i might have that aha moment when i suddenly realised it wa having some effect upon me but no nothing nothing good happened no overwhelm even just nothing other than an hour relaxation i could have achieved by any other mean
1	this album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the and s these song are a great mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work utterly together the foreground of the album for me is it is alright for lazarus i get wind the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to break off and have a good man cry it is a song written from the linear perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other foreground for me include shame right wrong girl and defy i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this phonograph recording and i am thankful that a gifted songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	would not be heartbroken if i lost the whole cd i seldom buy anything without listening to it beforehand with that finish in mind i heed to the whole album elsewhere i really do not bang how to describe how i feel it is not bad music it is not a bad album but it is not music that make me yell at people in the car to shut up so i can listen to the band i suspect that it would just play in the background now and eventide my economize would be okay with it i would never in a million yr be able to identify this a classic mumford logo other than the fact that the lyric are better than most band have i own a few cd that i would be absolutely heartbroken if i lost or broke this is not going to be one of them it is the kind of music you can perplex in the player in the truck and everyone can listen to but i would not play it driving at night because dare i say it is kind of boring and yawn inducing i am not going to purchase new i will wait for utilise and cheaper not that i think amazon is take too much i just do not think that this album is deserving my very voiceless earned dollar sorry mumford logo the album is ok but not what we really liked you for

1	fun song love it
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various check the song out and you might find you like it you are into hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn something pretty decent oh by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to mtv near you anytime soon
0	very disapointing sound like it is angstrom playing to slow obvisouly a recording problem
0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and reasonably deviod of the money plant and good taste evident from the fantabulous video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast shoot the smell throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i do not know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to choose part at all the appeal of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum
0	excessively his vocal are too modern country the song are depressing and mundane they are all too similar it just go on for too long
0	wow a christmas album featuring a rhodes i love rhodes piano and have one in my living room so i wa elated to see this cd but it is not played on a rhodes it sound like the electric piano patch on cut through a cheap keyboard complete with cheezy drum track it is make up definitely not played on any model howler of a real rhodes piano what a disappointment all the song are very stiff a if they were sequenced a note electric automobile prison term a time rather than played live i would love to know where they came up with the at the rhodes piano for the title
1	not bad great
0	make out did not like this version a much a the original but i still used this for a th class reunion power point presentation

0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time back in the on the radio kaos tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am indium a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this surge i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just keep raking in the cash i am not a dyed in the wool positivistic trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the forever and a day same note a mother pig surge three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death reliable another album that i found information technology so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought angstrom it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself decease to same who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and line there is hope for the human race i much prefer to think of roger water indium shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

1	i am not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song the ray sinatra orchestra mary martin doing the singing that is plus a it is pleasure to hear her why should not is third standard or maybe it is an standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight without an excess of jazz modifying it the one negative i have on is that they do not include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody lyric g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the

klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral but in all the other piece in the disc the are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind music such a put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender to realize that mahler music is not music fassbaender fails realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song de knaben wunderhorn are on this this review provides side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason below this review also provides a side by comparison one of the from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute in the french resume at second and at second reed and string join the fray at second the horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for rattle this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make entrance at min second tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very preference for the recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert and the baritone is sean the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock while the rattle recording is the minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording da lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and are sung by brigitte fassbaender who u a vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by male while others the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish i like this one best because it is the same melody a that found in the movement in mahler symphony no anyway compare the fish de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	from out of left field come the unknown ensnare hanley which you do not know unless you are into the whole post hardcore trend apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song observe the word maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and genuinely make it a rockin song causing it to end up a genuinely weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if you are into post hardcore modern rock or you are just looking for a song to turn up the stir up who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent ohio by the way i do not think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

0	i thought i wa buying the original recording from the but i bought some other modern song rendition solid ground what a shame amazon should not market classic music packaging to make it look like old music new who on earth want to listen to fake skynyrd
0	i know i am going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that really wanted to like this album and i am only writing this review for those who are up in air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content review is not for you i am not going to review each track because once you have heard the first few you will get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable steady in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think i am dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and i will admit that there are a few track on both see you on other side and the of the self album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just not worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the two yes doe he growl more sure are the memorable doe the music stand out not really i also get caught up giving new album a remarkable after one listen because i have been starved for new material but lately i have been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if i will feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing new release and they will forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player they will be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just is not that great i do not want to rip the because they are still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it is unremarkable candidly it is also forgettable my
1	great album can not wait to hear more from this group
1	i am touched by the depth of plumb song it really resonates with the pain i am current bring around from thank you plumb

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are sort associate in nursing of all of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa that she could joplin promise it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that non convinced with soul and depth even if power wasnt her strength this album is more like day in the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through you can not go wrong call for with brandi carlisle brook crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
0	the song wa fine but it downloaded a zip file i only need it to load to my other amazon music file window medium of my pc now i can not load the song onto my android ring i tried over and over again the amazon download procedure are too directed toward buying more amazon service and absolutely do not make me happy a a customer will individual call or email me and straighten this out

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it is a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time war technology pain and love it is easy to feel dissociated numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but have not articulated it even to abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on influence the main one i notice linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything mattered to is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye you have got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think you will want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time you are beautiful so censored beautiful i would be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march release from numbness come in the track what you see with an ironic twist they sing up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all go and i am not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who can not take that by all mean stay away but if you ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a
1	do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same metre the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the news is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice who doe not have to hollo or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent

1	it is virtuous pink
1	always a classic song great choice too
1	have to consider though that music of this kind of play and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	from dated revered the compilation album a closer end that recently started appearing on the p p network a well a on ebay and in sure record store is not an official dark tranquillity album but a bootleg it is very convincingly made with a century medium logo fake barcode and extensive booklet but it is nevertheless a bootleg it is usually a sound strategy to be silent about these thing but a a lot of people hold get off u asking whether a closer end is a genuine album or not and since the cd ha started to appear on online discography presented a a legitimate release we feel the need to set the record straight
0	i came to this wanting to like it i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work realize him a few time back in the on the receiving set kaos tour and again for his drab side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest concern with this album and to be honest much of rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if life is really that bad get a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can just continue spitting out this i hate this i hate that and so should you drivel and just bread and butter raking in the cash i am not a dye in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can pronounce here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the unrivaled that had the same notice a mother hog three dissimilar unrivaled and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a amused to death another album that i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it then i bought it again thinking maybe i wa too harsh on it i neer listen to it this is music to depress yourself to who need that if i want to be depressed i will watch the news i do not need to hear it in my music life is not that bad and there is trust for the human race i much opt to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

1	about do you is probably one of my most favorite song by carina round it is so soothing yet intense at the same time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a female singer with a beautiful graceful voice refined who doe not have to scream or raise her voice too complicate much just to show the power of her talent

1	there were a couple of top song from this album but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique hour angle sound
1	i do not agree with the earlier reviewer the beat are pretty nice if you are looking for strictly old school sounding beat that have a very raw rough feel and sound the right mix dj could fatten these up and then drop some serious vocal etc on top if however someone is looking for larger selection of beat some with music they could check out heat beat vol by royalty free then there is also a beat by a company called major league or something like that hope help

1	this album prompt me why i loved the newsboy so a lot through the and s these song are a great mix of tricky melodic line fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a manner of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it is fine for lazarus i heard the song for the showtime time when i wa running and nearly had to blockade and have a good man cry it is a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on this record and i am thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it is a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	his vocal are too modern country the song are depressing and mundane they are all too exchangeable it just go on for too long
1	beautiful song
0	lenny usually writes sung dynasty his own music or at least take part in co writing his song and i am sure this one is no exception however unlike many single off of lenny kravitz album shine this song is not very magical in fact it fall flat on the call for floor the guitar in the beginning is ok but then it fade sour for a long time the lyric are repetitive and unexciting and the song doe not explore like you would want it to sorry lenny maybe next time star end note at least he still following look good though i hope his next single make up is more original and heartfelt and le clich and boring this one sound like he wa so uninspired when they went in the studio to work the magic
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting not her strength and that seems to be what she went with here along with arrangement that are of of a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope with crystal wa she could joplin it a bit that she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that convinced with soul and depth even if power her this album is more like day the life ditty to be honest i could not even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of this all original and which caught me fully first time through can not go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice than she got in putting together this collection
1	grand
0	i came of age during the s and to this day the soundtrack of hair play in my head from time to time and it ha a certain sound robust edgy energetic and raw i agree with the reviewer who prefers to remember the original when the clothes were not costume and this wa not a period piece the version feel like a group of juillard educated musician bringing popular music to the upper crust if you like this edition at least also treat yourself to the original
0	range and paid for song only one song down loaded amazon site said all were down loaded my e mail to them for help wa never answered customer service suck

0	the background is shaver not a background you can listen the kid singing
0	great sung
1	angstrom you have to consider though that non music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a i am concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and that is job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely advocate with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would make up be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in john r major the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set
0	i have been a big boc fan the s and have gotten most of their album along the way but imaginos wa one that away from i have seen many online comment about how great it is and much the original cd ha brought online auction so when this reissue wa released i had to pick it up well it really doe not do it for me i am afraid the problem is that first of all it doe not sound like a boc and a i recently discovered it is not it a solo by bocs drummer albert bouchard and seems to be an attempt at a rock opera despite the effort of musician such a joe satriani robbie krieger the are ponderous and hardly distinguishable from one another the rather pointless re do of astronomy seems to indicate that there wasnt enough material to work with and if you are going to call this a boc album you have got ta have buck dharma who get short shrift here the is that the record company insisted that imaginos be released a a blue oyster cult album apparently realizing that this material wasnt going be too saleable on it own the album is a total disaster i kind of like the baron frankenstein number but i am very that i did not pay for it on ebay i would have been much happier with a reissue of bocs club ninja and hope to see that happen sometime soon p club ninja is coming soon
1	hope to hear more of him publicly ha a great voice and know how to sing those country song keep up the good work

0	i very seldom vex to compose a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter i have always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it i have always been able to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech seldom show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech baby sit around eating painkiller all day before recording either the dj washington completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different time signature other music genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sample distribution around this album seldom showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are in force track on this four hundred most of the anger part of the four hundred is pretty in force then slows down horrifically for the last part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the call beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne four hundred sound like tech washington trying to make a deep four hundred to start in your car if you have a in force sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to beat my trunk i would locomote buy one of the other crap hip hop four hundred that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an approachable album for the condition quo i am sure it will sell well i will decidedly take a long listen to the future tech n ne album before jumping in foot offset with a purchase again

0	it is quite funny how the lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band already start this on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound you would expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall then sound like they are attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of is pretty cool a well it is not a complete loss of an but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
