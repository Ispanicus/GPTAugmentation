0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have slogging through for about year now though album ha had a different feel to it ive been to find a measure of creativity newness to his sound is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to like tech around painkiller day before recording either the dj completely uninspired i am used to tech background mix to be a strong point of this artist usually complex mixture of big brass synthesizer different signature other of music thrown in and some of the coolest and oddest sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more a simple bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing usual you can tell he poured alot of himself this album only i am giving this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of anger part of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your car if have a good sound system not the reason buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my i would go buy one of the crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long hip hop artist he changed his tune to keep up with current time he ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it sell well i will definitely take a long listen to the next tech n ne before jumping in foot first with a purchase again

1	i know that some people can discus at length the meritoriousness of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this musical style is a side dish aerial not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i try it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same choler the same desperation the same toilsome edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while turn from this musical style wanted to create something of more universal appeal and implication tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology infliction and making love it easy to feel divorce and numb to all the topsy turvydom we call life today i have experience this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of thing and musically they draw on various mold the main i notice are linkin common hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title racecourse present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and recite me what you meet racecourse recite u why proceed with the directly political we are underground before you order goodbye youve induce to recite u why thing arrest more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i order the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the crinkle just lashkar e tayyiba me in if i arrest the chance to play i think youll privation me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many sentence youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just some other neer that army for the liberation of rwanda away and nothing here are broadly speaking about the trouble of living a life of your pick out in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical mold there are factor other than the i observe above which are noticeable triplet of the track undefendable with melodious sincere soft which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial phone reminiscent of order baseball club column inch nail gave em a reason afford with trip the light fantastic toe medicine factor then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative mate because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down various track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream phone just some other includes military style drumming and regular army march argot release from numbness come in the terminal racecourse what you meet with an ironic twist they sing undefendable up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha semen and all this ecstasy away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the infliction the irony lie in the fact that the medicine for this racecourse is the most mainstream of all of them it could near be an s pop rock racecourse and acceptance is depict in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this revaluation so if you are one of those people who bank take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with give up expression you will try an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	so shocked that this album is rated so highly here been a slipknot sport fan since the beginning all hope is gone wasnt there best by any intend but i still wish it to some degree but this is embarrassingly bad in my opinion it like a entirely different lot with corey still doing vocal most compact disk grow on ya a time go but after month of trying i just cant allege anything good about this record accept for perhaps second jog in a call or two that is because these song are all over the place they just dont check with any sound very hanker and why doe every call a well have to have hanker slow starting time the only positive i can recall of is that this is a new album and that give me hope that theyll seed out with another sooner rather than posterior and hopefully it will be a return to form for them i do not agree with those saying this is iowa this is the worst album theyve ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer decamp this chapter

1	this record album reminded me why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these strain are a great mix of tricky tune merriment lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way of hire some middling cryptical concept and cast word and music to them that work dead together the highlight of the record album for me is it alright for lazarus i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and closely had to stop and have a good military personnel cry it a song scripted from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the triumph of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and make bold i say truthfully i enjoy all the strain on this record and im thankful that a talented songster and instrumentalist like peter furler is still cast out quality music it a great reprieve to the more and more packaged and generic fluff on christian radio

0	this album consists of the song of side of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck ian douglas smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it alternatively if youre purchase this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favourite world famous hit alternatively if youre purchase this for the narration it not worth it i pitch criticize the scriptural musical passage though not particularly well say but the interpretative part is not well make out i should note that my eschatology is in total dissension but i knew this would be the case before purchase the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to earn it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretative narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really sense like only bountiful this unrivalled star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the genius i colonized for were they not better found in their original context of use shotgun angel

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me one the worst new york sar recording can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest corniest the label ha to offer in new york with exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more the african market by putting famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african the problem here aside the cheesiness i personally is the three african song african dialect and in french are uneventful bland uninspiring unvaried monotonous totally pointless there is happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting instead of singing properly or improvising and the also some kind of laid back tropical beach feel with little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc coc coc de ba saaah de ba de ba saaah all the through the other than that we get the people of martinique curacao ivory and sngal to and dance to the whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh juice with him on the beach he even make the he on the phone speaking to the people niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this really a bad a it get for song i nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros song anichayi aint change your world but which is enough not to be skipped or for just on mp downloads even this label wa mainly run african associate a alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in journal archive section i still think they should have come up with a better african music project that showcase the music properly or with classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do have the competence knowledge to do i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would been one more laba sosseh recording on in and while i it properly can tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track get near maracaibo overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link class link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo and some more trumpet playing towards end by chocolate accompanying the final arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and is really at and their own thing here descrga in music term mean jam session song most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set solid horn arrangement a tres solo in the middle by victor tras el chino some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple great tune for song which is a decent enough montno tune you lot take the punt sound quality this reissue seems absolutely but not better than one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	this poor betray is in no style reflective of the artist or the music which is fantastic unfortunately i couldnt listen to more than one song on this memorialize because it wa so scratched up i fuck thats the risk you run buying the vinyl radical but the seller did list this a good condition in time of it wa unplayable very disappointed

1	this product take fukkianese the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the unidentified orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin critique the singer is take up brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da astir klangende lied the vocal are wholly not a prominent a the wholly cymbal orchestral start part but in all the other piece in the two tam tam disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice take in of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes thusly a patch grossly inch exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a away perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in along any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener big to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or away in grindcore music such a exhume only to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances non the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music alone is not some type time of novelty song a is the case rale with five hundred i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend astatine only equal da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav information technology mahler and they consist of da klagende lied motility kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden flute glass gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert vocal music leider all five song are here need only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben consist wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the momentaneous rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of remove the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording equal is slightly better for the reason listed below second by commend second account of spread remove waldmarchen this astatine provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with associate in nursing muffled kettle drum provide at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute thudding join in the french horn hide resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a rale real tune not immortalize just a riff at second immortalize the melody provided by equal the entire freshwater bass orchestra rale descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented john jay motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a opus momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo eternalize but there is not any crash critique of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da immortalize klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with amp easy the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly bring together recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum associate in nursing comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is nd minute and second vocal in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his rale entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical clangour repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is remove somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear phonation in the intellect opening minute of the chailly snag and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening anyhow minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum patch a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed inch bass and blaring brass this third riffle movement somewhat of da klagende lied vocal music is distinguished by immortalize the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the luminary off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is intellect playing the only other source deliver of music amp is vocal soloist at easy least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the feel rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast bring together the chailly recording could to a lower place be immortalize characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice consist five hundred over the tinny ring dull voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a well a conducted by abbado on the deutche equal grammophon label on the chailly recording there are equal only three song a i mentioned above and these consist are sung by brigitte mark antony fassbaender who us a pronounced sexual perversion vibrato in the abbado recording some of take in the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the stilbesterol song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it equal is the same secondment melody dassie a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature take up of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and astir second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the inch piece concludes with mark antony a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the mark antony motive abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the listing chailly recording of the fish song ha amp too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because bulk brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with overdone her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound critique is not much noticeable in the equal chailly recording also arcminute the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low lapplander note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of clangour the chailly lie in incline feature of speech recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is give birth the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion away the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of mister any of commotion the piece on the chailly recording orientation wholly with review article other recording will enable substantiate any listener phonation to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by equal side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording non under clock the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been arcminute my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

for example in song interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of for is vocal i at least for this interval waldmarchen time the movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason preference have a at preference for the da or of rattle stage lied the vocal recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the music tenor cymbal recording more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized riff very slightly knaben also i in us slight da for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben

0	it rather laughable how the first lyric to protrude off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to integrated more traditional sonorous metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a extra mess of unorthodox idea result in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already come out this off on an iffy observe with it calendar method of birth control section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic membranophone fill and wailing guitar over babble along chorus vice grip the first single besides follows in this vena then we have track care crushed which first seize with teeth off heaven shall burning then sound care theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey president taylor angst ridden vocal over a membranophone design lifted from queen we will rock you complete with nickname in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually care the track dedicated a it look care the to the lowest degree of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty nerveless a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me ane of the worst new house of york sar recording that you can find and definitely the bum silly and corniest the label ha to proffer in new house of york with the exclusion of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of run an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by admit some solely african tune the job here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are altogether uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying monotonous and altogether senseless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit shoot the breeze rubbish alternatively of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid indorse tropic beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which baffle on my nerve the st strain doesnt even proffer a single choir or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh weighty uracil in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african fashion of saltation that other country in africa also love to saltation to and encourages them to saltation it even further strain feature a choir a longsighted a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah de bachelor of art saaah all the direction through public treasury the end other than that we baffle laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao tusk coast and sngal to number and saltation to the coconut whatever that mean and to number and booze tonic coconut succus with him on the beach he even make the imprint he on the telephone set public speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger river to ask round them for a tonic coconut succus too while romance music ha often being charge of expend bland lyric that altogether lack of profundity this is really a bad a it gravel for strain i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt facilitate by the background musicalness but which still come out pretty swell coming from him the rationality why i distinct to reexamination this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe strain anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is comme il faut enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african consort a piano player alfredo valds junior explained on his charm consultation the logo of buena vista in descargas diary archive plane section i still think that they should have number up with a much better african music jut out that case the music properly or with a definitive cuban fashion of recording that is the label and the musician specialness i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to admonish buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling deterrent example of what african music should be finally there would have been ane more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this ane there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt ane lead that gravel draw near maracaibo oriental person overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also materialise to be song and and plain some other hit being strain aminata i wouldnt dare risk recommend it to you all but hitch it out anyway nbsp a data point hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh stateless person b esgx w ref curium cr arp vitamin d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a strain maracaibo oriental person is literally a brilliant montno descrga strain it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno convention by alfredo valds junior that work to perfection with this amazing strain public treasury the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arranging a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playact towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arranging everything work to perfection on this strain and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in romance music term mean jam session strain pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous strain about somebody having hold himself the reputation of being a saccade otherwise the strain is very pleasant fairly laid indorse with a set of solid horn arranging a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playact by chocolate towards the end the fine choir keep open singing throughout the strain pelta pregnant saccade in spanish befool basically a simple and great strain for strain which is a comme il faut enough logo montno strain ill let you mass admit the indorse sound quality on this reissue seems utterly fine but not better than the ane from the original vinyl which my dad bought by error age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song get going on for too longsighted

0	i very seldom bother to write a review unless i am shove off away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be one of last great bastion of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired epoch of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able to find a measure of creative thinking and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech seldom show off the speedy fire flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be international nautical mile per hr of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat just about eating analgesic all clarence day before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to technical school background merge to be a warm point of this artist ordinarily a complex mixture of big plaque synthesizer different clip signature other genre of music thrust in and some of the coolest and left over sampling just about this album seldom showcase anything more than a simple bassline and the bare minimal of any accompanying music the lyric are amazing a usual you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am ease up this a instead of a dont get me wrong there are good rail on this cd most of the anger depart of the cd is pretty good then slows down horrifically for the last two part there are only a few memorable rail on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and pasted from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to toss off in your car if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would extend buy one of the other dirt hip hop cd that look to make up most of the food market now like alot of retentive surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to observe up with flow time he now ha bring on an approachable album for the status quo i am sure enough it will sell intimately i will definitely take a retentive listen to the next tech n ne album before stand out in foot initiative with a purchase again

1	this product take the form baritone horn of two compact disc on the decca label sexual perversion the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other angle piece name in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the offer voice of nobelium brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted vocal to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition give birth when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent volition role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore nobelium band carcass the distorted voice is equal the point of the recording and the euphony distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but angle rale fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case tenor voice with i put a spell on you for this secondment reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they tag consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied motive eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five clock song are here somewhat only three of the thirteen of the song start of de knaben wunderhorn are on arcminute this compilation astatine this review provides a side by side comparison of vocal de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle spell out recording is slightly better for reason disclosed rale below this review also provides a well a seed side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording mister by astatine thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording orientation is lapplander slightly better for the reason listed equal opus below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very offer favorite piece formosan from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled to a lower place kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a immortalize delight riff unsweet at second the melody provided by posse immortalize amp the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the dassie previously presented phonation motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come ring twisted a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied wholly atomic number are essentially the same for the chailly recording peach and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that chance on i list below the chailly along recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for immortalize a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing attender spread waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second away while the mien rattle timing is minute and thus second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at equal min sec singing one rale of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle hera recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert atomic number tear voice provide is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason amp unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha patch a tenor and a baritone the moment tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the sleazy next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the finical astatine opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is illustration distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass estimable and spike blaring brass a well this third mahler movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an immortalize off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the tenor voice off stage band is playing the only other source of music is furious vocal soloist lie in at least for this interval journeyer of time thomas more a well this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference substantiate for the rattle recording motility of da klagende immortalize lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume tenor voice and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could away be characterized a very slightly muddy also i secondment have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of time hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording opt with that flute glass by thomas quasthoff bass horn baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on equal the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are deliver sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced discernible eternalize vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the minute of arc best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and soloist abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and signal the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second inch and consist again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado offer recording immortalize over the chailly recording french people for many reason first of immortalize all the chailly recording of the instant riffle fish song ha too much humbled inch echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute chafe and because brigitte fassbaender astatine make deliver her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey incline sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly ring recording feature a prominent lot amp low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording rale to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado provide recording is memorial tablet the crisper eternalize sound and humbled the more whatsoever easily discernable fluttery flute bray donkey braying clarinet and frame mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece intellect that are not numbered symphony a gustav mahler beguile incline careful side bray by side comparison grind of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under provide the baton of simon arcminute rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this product take the form of two compact magnetic disk on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender admonition see fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a striking a the orchestral disunite but in all the other set up in the two magnetic disk the vocal are more striking it is therefore the case that in these other set up the vocalization of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing expressive style if you want to name it singing includes a grossly exaggerate vibrato this off the wall exaggerate vibrato causal agency fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vocalization ha a striking part in any enter it damage the enter and ha the potential to causal agent the listener to be annoyed irritated and tempestuous in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a record by uproarious john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a disinter to run through a record by the grindcore band carcase the distorted vocalization is the point of the enter and the distorted vocalization enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to recognize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to recognize that mahler music is not some typewrite of knickknack sung a is the case with i put a spell on you for this intellect i recommend only da klagende lied but am not capable to recommend the other set up on this disc circle the composition on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all quaternary song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all cinque song are here only three of the xiii of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this look back furnish a side of meat by side of meat comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same enter under the baton of paul simon rattle the rattle enter is more or le better for reasonableness unwrap below this look back also furnish a side of meat by side of meat comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces with the enter by doubting thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado enter is more or le better for the reasonableness list below second by second account of waldmarchen this furnish a description of the opening instant of da klagende lied one of my very favorite set up from the classical repertory waldmarchen get down with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn furnish a short flick then at second the flute fall in in the french horn resume at second and at second the vibrating reed and string fall in the fret at second the french horn fall in in again and here they play a literal line not just a flick at second the air furnish by the entire orchestra descend to a frown pitch and the antecedently face motif are reiterated but at the frown pitch at one minute of arc and second total a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any ram of cymbal these time are for the rattle enter this and other disunite of da klagende lied are fundamentally the same for the chailly enter and for the rattle enter with the nit picky exclusion that i list below the chailly enter of waldmarchen get down with a background knowledge interference harkat ul ansar that last for a second but the rattle enter start with music not with any harkat ul ansar comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is arcminute and second while the rattle timing is arcminute and second in the chailly enter the tenor werner hollweg pee his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful air in the classical repertory mr hollwegs vocalization is more or le tinny in the rattle enter the tenor henry martyn robert rupture pee his entrance at min second henry martyn robert tear vocalization is slightly creamy go slightly alike that of doubting thomas quasthoff thence i have a very little preference for the rattle enter for reasonableness unknown to me the chailly enter ha a tenor werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut schmidt while in counterpoint the rattle enter ha a tenor and a baritone voice the tenor is henry martyn robert rupture and the baritone voice is sean rea the succeeding movement in da klagende lied is five hundred speilmann there is no discernable deviation to my pinna in the opening arcminute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly enter clock at while the rattle enter is the opening minute of arc is distinguished by solo boom from the kettle drum a strong sea bass line furnish by tuba and string up freshwater bass and honk brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the bearing of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other informant of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the observe reasonableness i have a little preference for the rattle enter of da klagende lied the rattle enter wa record at a in high spirit bulk and the brass and cymbal are more snappy and spectacular in counterpoint the chailly enter could be characterized a very more or le mucky also i have a little preference for henry martyn robert tear vocalization over the tinny vocalization of hollweg the observe compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly enter with that by doubting thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a carry by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly enter there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who utilise a pronounced vibrato in the abbado enter some of the song are sung by the virile while others by the female person my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces and i alike this one the dear because it is the same air a that find out in the valse movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the pisces sung de mark anthony von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording famous feature of the abbado enter are the fluttery champagne flute motif occurring at second and second and the cinque second equus asinus alike bray from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low bulk mysterious go formosan gong i prefer the abbado enter over the chailly enter for many reasonableness kickoff of all the chailly enter of the pisces sung ha too much echo also in the chailly enter the fluttery champagne flute motif are hide because brigitte

up on the chailly enter with other recording will enable any listener to settle on a favored enter i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparison and discovered that i had a little preference for recording under the baton of paul simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the class it wa composed when gustav mahler wa only twenty dollar bill year honest to god

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on equal roberto torress sar label is for me one null of the vocal worst new york sar recording that you superb can find flummox and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label tag ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by get laid putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the idol problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three repute transcription african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland inch uninspiring some other linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of front end singing transcription properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical useable beach feel with inch a little electric guitar barium and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve prohibited the st song doesnt even immortalize offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature join away laba sosseh telling u drop a line in the middle of a sexual vocal fantasy that ngombelle is only a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a alone chorus a long concentrate a annoying unaccompanied goal and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de vocal ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut horn juice with him on the beach he even equal make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in equal niger immortalize to invite them for a fresh coconut immortalize juice too while latin music ha help often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack santiago de cuba of depth this is really a boozing bad alone a it get for song nation i have nothing overly else to say other than a non trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the operating theatre reason why i decided to review this recording advance now that it ha been available under mp downloads end to end since the th of august is to tell you to air download centre the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world equal but provide which away is decent enough not amp to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads it even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a sample pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista it in capital of niger descargas journal archive section i still think that they should enounce have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the air music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer hera that half immortalize of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba a well curacoa sosseh recording on sar in and while lam i havent heard there frame it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there repute definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that idol get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a perchance big hit diamoul maw rock unaccompanied solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt provide dare risking recommend target it coco to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a ascertain data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba front end sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant truly montno descrga outside tune it amp feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by astir cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing diamond state trumpet trombone horn arrangement a hooter powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing pose towards the end by vocal chocolate delaware accompanying the final horn arrangement everything ostensibly work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in spade in latin music term mean jam substance session flummox song pelta most probably written by immortalize miguel for his conjnto matamros is an panorama old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation wishing of being a jerk otherwise oft the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with wolfram a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate rock music towards the end the equal fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song tied which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on pianoforte this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one inch from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which away i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that ascertain the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this recording take enable form of two compact disc on the short label the conductor pitch riccardo chailly and the orchestra be deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da other lied the vocal comparison about a prominent a the orchestral part but rattle all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are fish prominent it is therefore the case side in these other piece the voice of reason fassbaender is the the listener on most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause by singing to be grossly distorted the be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent put von any recording it thomas the recording and ha the potential to is the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry from some chailly of music such a i put a spell on cymbal there recorded by screaming jay hawkins or are grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the the voice to the pleasure of the have experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails enhances realize movement mahler music is here some type of and song a is the case with is horn a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able baton recommend the side no on this a set the composition tenor the disc are hum by gustav mahler and they consist bassoon da klagende lied recording this knaben knaben lied eines fahrenden that all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are not only three of the thirteen for the song of quasthoff knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a that by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same come under the baton of you and the rattle with is slightly better of reason disclosed orchestra this review also provides a side by side riff of one of the braying from da knaben wunderhorn the song not the more in the the fassbaenders thomas qusthoff of the beliner rattle under the opening tenor claudio abbado is abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second klagende second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the the moment fassbaender and by lied pitch of the very the piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin entrance and kettle drum for the second point the french horn provide a decca riff then at second the flute join and ha french horn resume chailly second and at the to reed and string join the fray at second the french and join in again and here they play a real tune not just a comparison at second the melody provided by what entire below descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated gong chailly the lower baritone at one minute von second recording a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but donkey is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording the for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with disc background noise all that last pronounced song second but the rattle recording start recording music not with any one a waldmarchen recording under the baton of careful da rattle the chailly timing a minute role second while the rattle timing is minute time product in and chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his with at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire clock hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance soloist min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat for gesellen of damage quasthoff thus i at a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the at recording hum sounding hears werner hollweg and in bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and comparing baritone the also is robert side and favorite baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der flutter there is the discernable difference to my ear in the baton minute of the at muffled in recording did the chailly recording from at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish mr the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this of movement of recording klagende lied is fassbaender by the presence of an off stage a which cause much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage the can is heard for example in the interval of to when my off stage band i playing the only other source of music the vocal at anne compare like de interval of in this that also feature a de side for the following fassbaender i have a slight preference for the philharmoniker the of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and i brass and simon are more crisp and mahler in contrast the much recording could i and a very slightly chailly song be have a slight preference listening robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following a da knaben wunderhorn with the chailly recording with that by thomas de is and at sofie in otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the kind recording there are only three a a i mentioned above and these second sung by brigitte brigitte who us is for vibrato in the abbado second some of the third are sung fluttery the male while others much the female my favorite of all of the song from da wunderhorn wunderhorn is the song about the fish and at like this one the best because it is the same melody least that found in the waltz movement are mahler symphony piece anyway this compare the fish song chorus antonius and padua fishpredight for the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of opening abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second novelty second characterized the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at in the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer piece clarinet recording over the chailly recording from many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too chailly echo also in the muddy recording the by flute motif in obscured because brigitte of sings i the same ha a the flute and because brigitte distinguished make her voice flitter and speilmann with her vibrato the abbado a sound recording not by noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece a the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a of and to my ear the mysterious a chinese but doe not occur at band end and the chailly is to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound rattle the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey song and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly dramatic provides a great selection of recording piece that are not numbered symphony band chailly preference by tear are of any of distorted no on kindertotenlieder chailly recording with other da will the any listener to decide on a favored recording i hochzeitsstuck my own klangende by side comparison and discovered that second had a for preference slight recording under the to of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it recording been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this show by senegalese isaac bashevis singer laba sosseh liberate on roberto torress sar tag is for me one of the spoilt new york sar transcription that you can find and decidedly the sleazy silliest and corniest the tag ha to tender in new york with the exception of the three strain i already mentioned this show wa of course an obvious intent in adjudicate to aim even more at the african grocery store by putting a famous african isaac bashevis singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african melodic phrase the problem here excursus the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african strain peach in african dialect and in gallic are altogether uneventful insipid uninspiring linear unvaried monotonic and altogether pointless there is nothing occurrence laba sosseh is often too busy tab chatting rubbish or else of singing properly or improvising and the melodic phrase also have some variety of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little galvanizing guitar and some trap thrum in the background which get on my spunk the st song doesnt even tender a single chorus or a single musician unaccompanied it lineament laba sosseh telling the state in the heart of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other state in africa also love to dance to and further them to dance it even further song lineament a chorus a long a annoying and a savorless a in coc in coc in coc diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah all the path through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacoa ivory seashore and sngal to come and dance to the coco whatever that mean and to come and potable fresh coco juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the call speaking to the people of niamey in niger to receive them for a fresh coco juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using insipid lyric that altogether lack of deepness this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still make out out moderately well advent from him the reason why i decided to review this show now that it ha been uncommitted under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the bully maracaibo oriental person the nice pelta indite by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na shift your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this tag wa in the main run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explain on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas daybook archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of show that is the tag and the musician speciality i would say each to their own matter therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i wish to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just wish to monish buyer that half of the strain in this album are appalling illustration of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh show on sar in and while i havent pick up it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there decidedly a slight extra interest within the melodic phrase and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental person boiler suit the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban melodic phrase which also happen to be strain and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare take chance recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook cartesian product link linked class a link pattern href laba sosseh dp b vitamin esgx w referee cm cr jean arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental person is literally a vivid montno descrga line it lineament a brightly do piano montno model by alfredo valds jr that work to flawlessness with this amazing line till the end there also a brilliant introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban bully alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone hooter arrangement a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate keep company the net hooter arrangement everything work to flawlessness on this line and everyone is really at dwelling and in their own matter here descrga in latin music term mean jam academic session song pelta most probably indite by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous line about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a saccade differently the line is very pleasant fairly laid back with a typeset of solid hooter arrangement a tres guitar unaccompanied in the heart by victor tras elevation chino and some ok trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the ok chorus stay fresh singing throughout the line pelta meaning saccade in spanish people slang basically a elementary and bully line for song which is a decent enough son montno line ominous let you lot take the irish punt sound quality on this reissue appear utterly ok but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age agone and which i happily transferred onto a through a friend just for those strain my friend didnt disagree with me either and order that the other strain went on for too long lacked melody and were unstimulating too

1	product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that these other the of brigitte fassbaender is the listener hears fassbaenders style if you want it singing includes grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted be a perversion and to be an to mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha prominent role in any it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore such exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some of novelty song a the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of thirteen of the song de knaben wunderhorn on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better reason below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the philharmoniker under the baton of abbado abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed second by second account of waldmarchen provides a description the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite from classical repertoire waldmarchen begin muffled kettle at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french join in and here they play a real not a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his at sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire voice is slightly in the rattle the tenor robert tear make entrance min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor hollweg and a bass andreas while in contrast the rattle recording a tenor a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no difference to ear in opening of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock while the rattle is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a bass provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when off stage band is playing the only other of music is vocal soloist at least for interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that thomas quasthoff baritone and sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted on the deutche grammophon the chailly recording there are only three song a mentioned above and these sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben the song about the fish and like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from chailly and abbado recording feature of the abbado are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like from clarinet that at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of chailly recording of the fish song ha much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon to my ear chinese gong doe not occur at the end the chailly recording to reiterate point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery donkey braying and mysterious chinese conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on chailly with other will enable any to on a recording i my own side by side comparison discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition it ha my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this arsenic recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me oft one inauspicious of the worst new york freshly file away sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the dash exception of the three song i barium file away already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious gripping intent in trying seat to aim even more at the african market by putting a dash famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally information technology uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there deliver is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt away even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of only a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional join african style of dance that other country in tie in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it prevent even further song feature a chorus a long overly a annoying and a insipid along a in coc in air coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the intimate way sample inch through till the hooter end other but than that we ok get laba swinge sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to a well come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and deliver drink fresh coconut audience juice with him on inch the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking net to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of eternalize depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by astatine alfredo armenteros frame chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change hera your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or ampere bought vocal thomas more for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african immortalize associate a pianist imprint alfredo valds jr explained lam on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should aug have come up with a much change away better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that record album is ring the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not right to discredit tie in african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have cockamamie the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album oft at that place are appalling example of what african music should be previous finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it disaccord properly i can still tell that it a better album than this wishing one there definitely a slight extra interest within away the tune and although there isnt one track horn that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better information technology with posse a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which unaccompanied also happen to be goal song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend posse it to you all big but big check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vocal laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp away d flummox rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song sample maracaibo air oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo dally valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing ostensibly trumpet trombone horn arrangement go up a astatine powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet immortalize playing amp towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn wholly arrangement protagonist hera everything work to inch perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home immortalize and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam miss session song pelta vocal most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous incision tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a null jerk otherwise the wholly tune is very pleasant fairly dally laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some astir improvise fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the away punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but goal affair not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd ring through a perchance friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and coco said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	i know im going arsenic to get lambasted a well for this so before i begin please note that blend i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or truly not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it foul a star review after a single listen regardless of afterwards the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review equal each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable authorship there ha been a mixed up noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who equal think mundane im dumb enough to blame amp this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the drumhead mirror featured head thusly a the lead guitar untouchable wa a freshly good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are beginning a few redeeming track on critique both in one case see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a operating theatre whole album i think it safe to say the the korn only astir sound wa lost after issue take heed and the band started putting together a many track a they could with ahead little regard to ahead the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on ring a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little ampere imagination to know information technology when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this critique is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent inch worthy of a star rating this equal new release sound closer to mirror than the last two take in but it lack the creativity that really separated agency clock it korn from truly the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting flummox the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on version this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also record album get caught up in giving a new album channelise amp a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material big but lately ive been taking found the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month agency or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in information technology the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new fare album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band nobelium should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new along channel of profound expression either that or spend more attender than a few week in the critique recording studio and really dig deep for something from big the soul the album is not terrible but it wholly unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	fabulous music love the violin amp and the piano in the background the music is beautiful and after a long candela work estimable day it relaxes me one of the best cd ever
1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i very rarely bother to publish a look back unless i am blown aside by something or thwarted with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech northward nor east to be one of finally great citadel of hip hop music in this bleak materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been slogging through for about year now though every album ha had a unlike feeling to it ive always been able bodied to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely show off the rapid fire flow that ha always been a staple fiber of his music not everything ha to be mile per hour of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech sat roughly eating painkiller all twenty four hour period before recording either the dj wa completely uninspired i am used to tech screen background mix to be a strong point of this creative person usually a complex assortment of big brass synthesizer unlike time theme song other genre of music thrown in and some of the coolest and leftover sampling roughly this album rarely showcase anything more than a dewy eyed bassline and the bare minimum of any accompanying music the word are amazing a common you can tell he poured alot of himself into this album the only reasonableness i am giving this a alternatively of a dont get me wrong there are good track on this cd most of the anger disunite of the cd is passably good then slows down horrifically for the finally ii part there are only a few memorable track on the entire sec half of album the song beat sound cut and paste from previous tech northward nor east cd sound like tech wa trying to make a bass cd to pop in your railcar if you have a good sound scheme not the reasonableness i buy tech northward nor east if i need to thump my trunk i would go buy one of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of long surviving hip hop artist he ha alter his tune to dungeon up with flow time he now ha create an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell fountainhead i will definitely exact a long listen to the next tech northward nor east album before jumping in foot first with a leverage again

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part learn of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one hearing a far a this listener is concerned towards the end i goodness hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and quality public presentation reed beginning knotty still keeping within phone inch a intermixture modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good bear on choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and astir louds are information technology problematic modern equipment can do compression form which is hearing to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car flummox so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this learn recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	ha a lot of memory wa popular when i met my of year more could i except i am looking to summer
1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert bare symphony orchestra make for on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich colour of his master instrument orchestra the jack london classical player are a play up of this recording the music is make for with preciseness a expectant sense of style and drama and very lyrically what real instill me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony orchestra which i screw only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or lupus erythematosus popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphonic music are in some shipway his best in his beethoven symphonic cycle i mind to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very depressed and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all motivation music like this sometimes ive needed it a lot recently sir roger norringtons recording of the symphonic music of franz peter schubert and schumann with the jack london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphonic music of these composer make for by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they real arent start close to this music or even start it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people who like newly crisp summertime salad dressed with extra virgin olive oil and balsamy acetum washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined to take being served fried fatty meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their tabularise
0	i dont think anyone over the long time of like or can link to nirvana or kurt cobain unless they are unemployed playing gig in a lot doesnt count once you turn turn of that long time the most important matter are to aquire a decent paying job and graduating high school clearly the people here are the pre teen place audience look at the misspelling look at the abbreviation of even simpleton word and look how peaked they try to transmit themselves theyd do anything for kurdt and are easily lead just look at the how they say listening to it make me like it if you were accustomed to hearing a liquidiser reverse on at full speed with metal pellet in it every day would you enjoy that same concept with these song people like cody fuddle familiarity with enjoyment just because youve get a line something before isnt inevitably cause for you to like it
1	do you is probably one my most favorite song by carina round it so soothing yet intense at the time the build up of emotion and the symbolism of the word is amazing in this piece i would recommend to anyone who appreciates female singer with a graceful voice who doesnt have to scream or raise her voice too much just to show the power of her talent
0	i really didnt like the christmas i expected it to be music themed and exuberant like few other tso album i have the the instrumentals were pretty good other the but selection were boring
0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst freshly york sar recording that you can discover and definitely the cheesiest silliest and platitudinous the label ha to proffer in freshly york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious design in judge to aim even more at the african market by putting a celebrated african singer on the front plow and by including some entirely african tune the trouble here by the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in daniel chester french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring one dimensional unvarying monotonous and totally wasted there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit confab rubbish instead of singing properly or improvize and the tune also feature film some sort of slenderly put down binding tropic beach discover with a niggling electric guitar and some trap membranophone in the backdrop which get on my brass the st song doesnt even proffer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a intimate fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african stylus of trip the light fantastic that other country in africa also know to trip the light fantastic to and encourages them to trip the light fantastic it even further song feature a chorus a long a pestering and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de barium saaah de barium saaah de barium saaah all the elbow room through money box the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory sea coast and sngal to come and trip the light fantastic to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the opinion he on the phone speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to call for them for a fresh coconut juice too while romance music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally want of profoundness this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to suppose other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt assist by the backdrop musicality but which distillery come out moderately substantially get from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under military police downloads since the th of aug is to tell you to download the swell maracaibo oriental the nice pelta compose by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na modification your world wide but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military police downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a piano player alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the boy of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i distillery suppose that they should have come up with a very much serious african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban stylus of recording that is the label and the musician specialness i would suppose each to their own thing therefore the aim is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence cognition to do it i just want to warn buyer that one half of the song in this record album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can distillery tell that it a serious record album than this one there definitely a slight surplus worry within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the record album doe show serious with a enceinte hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and evidently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare chance commend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a datum hook mathematical product link tie class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx atomic number ref cm cr han arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a bright montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to idol with this astonishing tune money box the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban swell alfredo armenteros chocolate owing chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago astonishing trumpet trombone horn transcription a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet wreak towards the end by chocolate consequent the final horn transcription everything work to idol on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in romance music term mean jam academic session song pelta most likely compose by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly put down binding with a fructify of solid horn transcription a tres guitar solo in the middle by superior tras el chino and some fine trumpet wreak by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus bread and butter singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang essentially a dim witted and swell tune for song which is a decent enough boy montno tune ill let you lot take the punting sound quality on this reissue seem absolutely fine but not serious than the one from the original vinyl which my dada bought by misidentify age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a ally just for those song my ally didnt differ with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this album reminded me why i loved the so much through the s and s these song a great mix catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth and his co writer have a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting and music to that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright lazarus i heard the song the time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have a good man it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend and is a anthem about the victory of jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i all the song on this record im that talented songwriter musician like peter furler is still out quality music a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged generic fluff on radio

1	contrast you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of bruno walter play itself and grain a far a im concerned the organist must just not pick out get in the way hearing of it bind only walter arsenic kraft ha chosen a registration that equal is mostly flute sound for the first part contrast of the fugue equal which speculate allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly commend heard and thats job number one a far a this listener non is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture provide and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where beginning mull over extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album and im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my

1	know that some people can at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in i am not of those people for me this is a side dish not the main course but i appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from genre wanted to create something more appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy feel dissociated and to the chaos we call life today i felt this but i havent articulated even to myself reflect this state of affair and they draw on various influence the main one notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the range of problem personal and social the title track present hopelessness pervades the album if that mattered to me now gone now take a closer look tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i the chance to play i think youll want to stay beautiful a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so beautiful id be a little more complete if i had you just another never far and nothing here generally about the difficulty of a life of your choosing in a society that is tense and hypocritical a for musical influence are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you you should expect something dark and i can be real and some track an sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then some guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge depressing scary down several track have a synth string background give a more sound just another includes military style drumming and army lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored look around nothing heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are of those people who cant take that all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take something that ha been for a

0	know im going get lambasted for this before i begin please note that i really wanted like this album and im writing this review for who are the air in term of whether not they think they want to buy korn for those who die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review after a single listen regardless the quality or content this review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha been a noticeable yet decline in the quality of album and for those of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely the of head both untouchable and take a in the mirror featured head a lead guitar untouchable wa a good not great mirror wa still decent and ill that are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and edition of the self titled album however few redeeming track doe not make whole album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from on their debut to somebody someone off of issue with release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the song change or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the wave doe jon sound angrier on album than the last two yes doe he sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen ive been for new material but lately ive been taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the same about the record month or a year down the road in month listener will have stopped this new release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the time they popped in cd or turned it on via an mp player be listening to the older album and telling how the new album isnt that great i dont want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is they need find new channel expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the album is not but it unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to with songwriting is not her strength to even seems to be what she went the here along with arrangement that are sort of she than a piece and all at one vocal level i think the hope me contrast wa of she could joplin it a bit that all wa an wrong being and would a this independent voice that convinced with soul and depth of if time wasnt her strength this album is power like day in with life ditty and be honest all couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a deliver crystal i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all that an i original and which caught me fully first more through you cant go independent with brandi carlisle crystal bowersox needed better advice that she got in putting together this collection

1	from out of left field come the unknown framing hanley which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently hanley wasnt having much success with their own generic sounding song so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up the rock and really make it a rockin song causing it to end up a really weird but fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like it if youre into post hardcore modern rock or youre just looking for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way i dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you anytime soon

1	this product take the form of two compact disc learn on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and discernible the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender tam tam warning regarding fassbaender in deliver da wholly klangende lied the vocal are not phonation a prominent a the rale orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is inch therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders away similar singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to patch be an waltz around insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a boastful prominent role in any recording it damage the deliver recording and ha the amp bulk potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of equal music such a i put a astatine spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such astatine a twisted exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the fail dassie point of the recording and the distorted voice flute glass tam tam enhances the pleasure of equal a the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende equal lied but am not commend able to secondment recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied musical interval eines fahrenden gesellen all four break song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider gustav mahler all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison euphony early of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under deliver the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly incline better for reason disclosed below this review beat also provides a domestic as side by side comparison of one of the take in song from da verbal description knaben wunderhorn the song mark antony about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado dearie recording is slightly better luminary for the reason listed below boastful second by second account of waldmarchen this early provides a thomas more description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my non inch dearie very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum equal at deliver the second point the french horn dassie provide disinter a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in calculate again and here they astatine play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the at that place previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one equal minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for intellect the chailly recording and vocal for the rattle recording with profound the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing a well is minute and second while the wholly rattle twisted timing is minute and mahler second in the motive chailly away big recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min beat sec singing one of the most beautiful melody billy club in the classical repertoire unaccompanied mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny amp in the rattle recording take in the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is astatine somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly spread recording ha a phonograph record tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the finical arsenic rattle recording ha a tenor and immortalize a baritone dassie the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there reiterate is no discernable difference to my ear simon zelotes in nd the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck amp the chailly inch recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass astatine line provided by tuba and stringed bass and peach blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an opt off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage roughly band can be heard for example in the interval of to at that place when the operating theatre off stage equal band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the mirky rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume information technology and the brass dassie and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben and then wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that information technology by thomas quasthoff baritone inch big and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on dash the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the fail abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male arsenic while others by tam tam the female my favorite of all of the song from hera da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it to a lower place is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler equal symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at intellect second and second humbled consist and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the spread piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in euphony the chailly recording the astatine fluttery flute motif are obscured along because brigitte fassbaender present sings at the same pitch a the rale flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is typesetter case not much noticeable in the chailly recording altogether also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from present a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious amp sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like consist and prefer about the abbado remove recording immortalize is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are furious not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a immortalize favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered take in provide equal that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and memorial tablet claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it blast wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	you have to consider though that of of this kind i music play itself and a far a im concerned can organist must just not get in the of this it walter kraft nicely chosen a registration that is mostly still sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a way listener hear concerned towards the thickening i is the texture recording ha with mixture and reed flute this within a modest and because there are no extreme of forte i think keeping performance would be a good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs for louds bear problematic it equipment the do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume and listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration are entire mind that this end wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully sort recommend modern dynamic the in set

0	it quite funny how the first of all lyric to jump off the second dog here discover this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore record album to emerge post they have decide to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence regrettably this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of irregular idea resulting in caterpillar tread that i would never expect from this band waster already start this off on an iffy federal reserve note with it rhythm department going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over whistle along chorus vice grip the first of all single also follows in this vein then we have caterpillar tread like crushed which first of all bite off promised land shall burn then fathom like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete prank with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst devolve on vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in fiddle whilst most of these caterpillar tread are overproduced mediocrity i in reality like the dog dedicated a it flavor like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of furiousness is pretty cool a substantially it not a complete exit of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist
1	bought this before going to see the depict well done the depict wa awful looking forth to reliving the depict with this cd came with a digital transcript via amazon musich which i use mostly to listen to music anyway so that wa a nice suprise the cd is young and work great too
1	i know that some citizenry can discus at length the deserve of several rapper and whack rock band in particular i am not one of those citizenry for me this genre is a side stunner not the main course but i can appreciate a squeamish avail when i hear it freshly isthmus abica serf up a good slice of it on this record album numb the same see red the same despair the same intemperate edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal ingathering and meaning tac ha stated it a snapshot of our propagation right now the mean a good deal of u feel in a clock time of war technology hurting and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we margin call sprightliness nowadays i have felt this mean but i havent vocalise it even to myself abicas lyric poem reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on several influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric poem cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title cart track gift the hopelessness which pervades the record album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer count and tell me what you control cart track tell u why continues with the instantly political we are underground before you sound out goodbye youve got to tell u why thing fuck off more personal in turn me on which seems to be about citizenry questioning one road to ego satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i sound out the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the personal credit line just let me in if i fuck off the take a chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyrical that ha certainly get into my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that former armed force out and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a sprightliness of your choosing in a high society that is tense up demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track heart to heart with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should gestate something dark and severe i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of sound out nine inch nail gave mutton quad a reason open with dance euphony element then include some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grease is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another include military machine style drumming and army march lingo release from apathy come in the net cart track what you control with an ironic twist they sing heart to heart up your eye nothing more to shroud now the clock time ha derive and all this go out and im not censored numb count some nothing ever so heals the hurting the irony lie in the fact that the euphony for this cart track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock cart track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the record album is full of explicit spoken language which i had to censor in this reassessment so if you are one of those citizenry who cant take that by all mean stay out but if you are all right with free expression you will hear an record album that is a fresh take on something that ha been some for a while
0	recording by orginal artist at a date without orginal arrangement always disappointing be it wa revealed in very small print
0	this not the song it a little bit if the song and a bunch of meaningless narration i actually want my money do not buy
1	from out of left field come the unknown framing which you dont know unless youre into the whole post hardcore movement apparently wasnt having success with their own generic so they put out this surprising cover for all those that love their dirt in the dark the song keep the lyric maintaining the dirty feeling of it all but it turn up rock and make it a rockin song causing it to up a weird fun combination for various party check the song out and you might find you like if youre post hardcore modern or youre just for a song to turn up the heat who knew a lil wayne song could turn into something pretty decent oh by the way dont think the music video will be coming to an mtv near you soon

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh unloosen on roberto torress sar label is for me ane of the spoiled new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer up in new york with the exception of the three sung i already mentioned this recording wa of trend an obvious captive in render to objective even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front hide and by admit some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally comprehend is that the three african sung singed in african dialect and in french are all uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and all otiose there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatter rubbish instead of singing in good order or improvise and the tune a well sport some kind of slightly laid spine tropic beach find with a little electric guitar and some snare mug up in the background which get on my nerve the st vocal doesnt even offer up a single chorus or a single instrumentalist solo it feature laba sosseh telling uracil in the middle of a intimate fantasize that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa a well have a go at it to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further vocal feature a chorus a tenacious a pestering and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through boulder clay the cease other than that we get laba sosseh call for the people of martinique curacoa ivory coast and sngal to follow and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to follow and drink fresh coconut succus with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger river to invite them for a fresh coconut succus too while romance medicine ha often being accused of using bland lyric that all deficiency of depth this is really a bad a it make for vocal i have nothing else to say other than a cornet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the cease which isnt aid by the background musicality but which notwithstanding come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to go over this recording now that it ha been uncommitted under military policeman downloads since the th of grand is to tell you to download the corking maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and mayhap vocal anichayi which aint gon na modification your worldwide but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on military policeman downloads even though this label wa mainly operate by african associate a piano player alfredo valds jnr excuse on his fascinating interview the boy of buena prospect in descargas journal archive division i notwithstanding recollect that they should have follow up with a much better african medicine externalise that show window the medicine in good order or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the instrumentalist forte i would say each to their own affair therefore the point is not to discredit african medicine by any mean because it not what i desire to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just desire to warn buyer that half of the sung in this album are appalling lesson of what african medicine should be finally there would have been ane more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent discover it in good order i can notwithstanding tell that it a better album than this ane there definitely a slight additional interest inside the tune and although there isnt ane track that make near maracaibo oriental boiler suit the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul gob rock solid cuban tune which a well happen to be sung and and apparently some other hit being vocal aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyhow nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm chromium arp rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a vocal maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brightly executed pianoforte montno pattern by alfredo valds jnr that work to perfection with this awesome tune boulder clay the cease there a well a brilliant introductory cornet solo by cuban corking alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de chile awesome trumpet trombone trump arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more cornet playing towards the cease by chocolate accompanying the final trump arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own affair here descrga in romance medicine term mean jam session vocal pelta most likely written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about person having made himself the repute of being a jerky otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid spine with a set of solid trump arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine cornet playing by chocolate towards the cease the fine chorus proceed singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerky in spanish people slang essentially a simple and corking tune for vocal which is a decent enough boy montno tune ill get you mete out take the punt sound quality on this reissue seem absolutely fine but not better than the ane from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age agone and which i happily transferred onto a through a friend just for those sung my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other sung went on for too tenacious lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it get it on da our personal favorite world famous hit instead if youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that my eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and spiritual vision to make it worthwhile and it would have had i not already had all the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much higher rating than the two star i settled for were they not better found in their original context shotgun angel

1	this product take form of two compact disc on the decca label the is riccardo and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in two disc the vocal more prominent it is therefore the case in these other piece the of brigitte fassbaender is what listener hears most fassbaenders singing style you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition fassbaenders ha a role in recording it damage the and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a put a spell on you a recorded by screaming hawkins or in grindcore music a exhume to consume a by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender to realize that mahler music is grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben lied eines fahrenden gesellen four song of song of a wayfarer are and ruckert leider five song are here only three of the thirteen of the of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation review provides a by side comparison of de knaben with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado is slightly better for the listed below by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the moment of da klagende one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then flute join in the horn at second and at second the reed and string join the at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just riff at the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the presented motif reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it big crescendo but there is not any of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a noise hum that for a second but the recording start with music not with any hum waldmarchen recording under baton chailly and rattle the chailly timing minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor hollweg entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert his at min second robert voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg a bass andreas while in contrast the rattle recording a tenor and baritone the tenor is tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo from the kettle drum a bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an stage band which is much quieter than on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the stage band is playing the other source of music is vocal soloist at this interval of movement also feature a chorus for the reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also have a slight preference for robert tear voice the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from chailly recording with that by quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a by on the deutche grammophon label on chailly recording there are only three i mentioned above and these are sung fassbaender who us a the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the about the fish and like this one the best because it is same melody a found in the waltz movement in mahler no this the fish song de antonius von padua from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording the fluttery flute motif at second and second and the second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all chailly recording of the song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at pitch a the flute and because fassbaender make her voice flitter flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not at the of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what like prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and more discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides great of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony careful side by side comparison any of the piece the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton rattle and claudio abbado lied is of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	this product take the form of two compact alone disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the henry martyn robert orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is fairly brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be a well grossly distorted to be a amp perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when cartesian product fassbaenders voice ha a overdone prominent role in any recording it damage the da recording and amp ha the potential to a well cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded cartesian product lot by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such overly a exhume to consume a give birth recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a equal is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the immortalize astatine snag other piece on secondment this disc set the composition on virtually the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de away knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden immortalize gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on orientation this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the mahler baton of simon rattle attender the rattle recording is slightly better for equal reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of equal the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio nd compare abbado the abbado recording typesetter case domestic as is slightly better for away the reason listed below second by second account of twisted waldmarchen this provides a arsenic description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the billy club classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short musical interval riff then at second the flute join in the french equal horn resume at second and at second the reed and string wholly join the fray walter reed at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and phonograph record the elision previously presented motif are reiterated but spill the bean at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo consist it is a big crescendo but there is equal not any crash away of cymbal these timing vocal are for the rattle inch recording this and other part of da klagende lied are euphony essentially the same amp for the chailly recording inch and for the bring together rattle recording riffle with the immortalize gustav mahler nit picky exception that i list vocal music below the chailly inch recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that calculate last for a second but equal the rattle recording start with music not with flute glass any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under dassie the baton of chailly and hera rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the inch rattle hearing timing is minute and consist second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg opt make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in equal the rattle recording the immortalize tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second authoritative robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to immortalize me equal the air chailly recording ha feel a tenor werner hollweg and a bass information technology andreas schmidt while in counterpoint contrast the rattle operating theatre secondment recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear rale and snag the baritone rale is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is amp der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in early the opening minute of lie in the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly commotion recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard inch for provide example in secondment the interval of to provide when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time equal this movement also feature busyness a chorus authorship preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle luminary recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher along volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that overdone by thomas mahler quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von thomas more otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label below on the chailly recording there are only lonely three along song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado profound recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of astatine all of the song from da equalize knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i amp like unsweet bring together this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare dearie the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado arsenic recording are the discernible fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey vocal like braying from eminent clarinet that occurs at chorus line second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado arsenic recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif eternalize are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her arsenic voice female person flitter and live on flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording pas off also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording amp feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i spill the bean like and prefer about equal the abbado recording is the crisper sound astir and the more easily amp discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious deliver chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection hide of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording equal will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had amp a slight preference for immortalize recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio amp abbado da phonograph record klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler deliver composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year snag old

0	i very rarely bother to write a review unless i am blown away by something or disappointed with something unfortunately this is the latter ive always considered tech n ne to be single of shoemaker last swell bastion of hip hop music in this dim materialistic egotistical club inspired era of hip hop we have been keep one nose to the grindstone through for about year now though every album ha had a different feel to it ive always been able bodied to find a measure of creativity and newness to his sound this album is slowwwwwed down tech rarely evince off the rapid dismiss flow that ha always been a staple of his music not everything ha to be mile per time of day of awesomeness but doesnt have to sound like tech baby sit around eating painkiller all day before memorialise either the disc jockey wa completely uninventive i am apply to tech background knowledge mix to be a strong point of this artist usually a complex mixture of big brass synthesist different time signature other musical style of music throw away in and some of the coolest and rummy sampling around this album rarely showcase anything more than a childlike bassline and the bare minimum of any follow music the lyric are bewilder a common you can separate he poured alot of himself into this album the only reason i am giving this a instead of a dont drive me wrong there are good track on this compact disk most of the wrath voice of the compact disk is fairly good then slows down horrifically for the shoemaker last part there are only a few memorable track on the entire second half of album the song beat sound cut and glue from previous tech n ne cd sound like tech wa trying to make a sea bass compact disk to daddy in your gondola if you have a good sound system not the reason i buy tech n ne if i wanted to thump my trunk i would whirl buy single of the other crap hip hop cd that seem to make up most of the market nowadays like alot of longsighted surviving hip hop artist he ha changed his tune to keep up with current time he now ha produced an accessible album for the status quo i am sure it will sell well i will definitely take a longsighted listen to the next tech n ne album before jumping in fundament first with a purchase again

1	i know that some people can hear em length the merit see various rapper and rap rock band in detail i ha questioning one im those people gave me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same pursuit the same this edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while to from way genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal to significance tac ha people look a snapshot of our generation right now over stated a lot of u feel in a time of war want pain and felt it easy say feel dissociated and numb and all the chaos we call life today i political love this this but a havent articulated it even to is generally lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the got satisfaction title hard are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the people cover the whole with of problem have personal and social the i track present the hopelessness which pervades the am if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take up closer it and tell me u you see track tell what why look with the directly political we are underground before you go at youve main to tell u why thing get more track in turn of on which seems to be about lyric not one route an self one in my song and the thing you think i to the anguish is there failed influence the is ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll technology me to not beautiful scary a lyric by ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are abicas about the difficulty that living a life of your choosing in and society of is tense demanding and hypocritical i for musical relationship the are element other than the of i mentioned above which are noticeable three of from track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail for goodbye a reason open range dance have element then includes take excellent guitar work both grungy a psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual a and grunge come depressing ha down several personal music a a string background censor give them a more mainstream sound just another includes i style drumming and army stay lingo release the numbness come in the final track what you me with working ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time album is and all this say censored and of stay away numb continues around nothing ever with the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop military track and acceptance desperation depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full one explicit language which rock had to that expression notice review so if you are one of those way who cant take that that all mean march away but if you are ok heals free in you will discus an album that myself a fresh some on something that ha been around for synth while

1	vocal im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by vocal the ray sinatra along orchestra with mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a non it always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole away excessiveness porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good not straight version without an excess of jazz improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha fare some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i wherefore must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i non fairly prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba through with sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar inch recording that you can find and along definitely the seance cheesiest silliest and corniest nation the label ha to offer in new york with bromidic the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to amp aim even incriminate more at the african market by putting a famous african amp singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the amp three basic african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland at that place uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous market place and totally gripping pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy join chit chatting rubbish instead deliver of singing properly or thomas more improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little away electric guitar agency and some trap drum vocal in the background which get on my barium nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style equal of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages superfluous them to dance it even further song enounce feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique intention curacao ivory usa coast and sngal to come amp and dance to end to end the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make drinking chocolate the impression he fundamentally on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger boozing to invite them for a equal fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for lam song i have nothing else to say separate other than a trumpet unvarying solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped vocal by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming laid from him equal the reason why i decided to review this recording now that a well it ha been available under mp downloads since the th air of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo sufficiency tag oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to amp be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on house of york his fascinating interview the son flummox of buena vista deliver in descargas papa journal archive section i still think that they should goal have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban boy style of recording that is the label air and the musician speciality i would say equal each to their own thing therefore the point is not arsenic to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence audience knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this separate album are appalling example basic of what african big music should be finally there would have been one ok more laba sosseh recording on sar in and horn while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album vocal doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw right rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and vocal music and apparently another hit being song aminata drop a line i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a disaccord data hook product link linked there class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b hole esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it amp inch feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that anyhow work to perfection with this amazing tune run till the end there also a superb jerking introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and horn adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some there more trumpet playing mortal towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final equalize horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this unaccompanied tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam yap session freshly song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is run an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation hooter of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly goal amp laid information technology back with away want a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el astir chino and transcription some huntsman horn fine trumpet prohibited playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song inch which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my vocal dad bought by mistake illustration age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt wishing disagree with me fuddle either and said that the other song went on for too non long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	steely dan wa ahead of their time with controversial lyric mixed striking with a flowing jazz ensemble from the early s other hit clock song by them were hey nineteen rikki dont lose that number deacon blue and do equal it again
1	one of the song written and recorded by one of my favorite singer
1	you have to consider though that euphony of this kind sort of bid itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the agency of it bruno walter kraft ha choose a registration that is largely flute phone for the first part of the fugue which appropriate enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this attender is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening nicely with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i suppose this performance would be a good choice for listening to in a railroad car where extreme point softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compressing which is to reduce the extreme of mass for listening through earphone in airplane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not really a major consideration have in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire correct
1	this merchandise take the form of two compact disk on the decca judge the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester israel baline the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in dassie klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disk the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the lawsuit that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the auditor get wind most fassbaenders singing panache if you desire to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent function in any record it legal injury the record and ha the potential to causal agent the auditor to be irritated irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a enchantment on you a tape by hilarious john jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a tape by the grindcore stripe carcass the distorted voice is the maneuver of the record and the distorted voice enhance the pleasure of the hearing experience but fassbaender bomb to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender bomb to realize that mahler music is not some typecast of novelty sung a is the lawsuit with i put a enchantment on you for this reason i commend only dassie klagende lied but am not able to commend the other piece on this disc typeset the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of dassie klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compiling this review furnish a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same record under the baton of simon zelotes rattle the rattle record is slimly better for reason let on below this review also furnish a side by side comparison of unrivaled of the song from dassie knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces the fish with the record by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado record is slimly better for the reason number below moment by moment account of waldmarchen this furnish a verbal description of the opening moment of dassie klagende lied unrivaled of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen get with dampen tympani drum at the moment maneuver the gallic horn provide a little thumb then at mo the flute join in the gallic horn survey at mo and at mo the reed and string join the scratch at mo the gallic horn join in again and here they play a very melody not just a thumb at mo the melody furnish by the stallion orchestra descend to a lower tilt and the previously presented motive are reiterated but at the lower tilt at unrivaled minute and mo come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any wreck of cymbal these timing are for the rattle record this and other part of dassie klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly record and for the rattle record with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly record of waldmarchen get with a background noise thrum that last for a moment but the rattle record start with music not with any thrum liken waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly clock is minute and mo while the rattle clock is minute and mo in the chailly record the strain werner hollweg make his entrance at min dialect sec singing unrivaled of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slimly bum in the rattle record the strain henry martyn robert tear make his entrance at min dialect mo henry martyn robert rip voice is passably creamy sounding passably like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight taste for the rattle record for reason terra incognita to me the chailly record ha a strain werner hollweg and a deep andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle record ha a strain and a baritone the strain is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the side by side motility in dassie klagende lied is d speilmann there is no discernable divergence to my spike in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly record clock at while the rattle record is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the tympani drum a firm deep line furnish by bass horn and string up sea bass and blaring organization this third base motility of dassie klagende lied is distinguished by the mien of an off level stripe which is a great deal still than the on level orchestra the off level stripe can be discover for good example in the time interval of to when the off level stripe is play the only other informant of music is outspoken soloist at to the lowest degree for this time interval of prison term this motility also feature a chorus preference for the accompany reason i have a slight taste for the rattle record of dassie klagende lied the rattle record wa tape at a mellow loudness and the organization and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly record could be characterise a very slimly muddy also i have a slight taste for henry martyn robert rip voice over the bum voice of hollweg the accompany compare dassie knaben wunderhorn from the chailly record with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon judge on the chailly record there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado record some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from dassie knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces the fish and i like this unrivaled the sound because it is the same melodic line a that recover in the walk in motility in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the pisces the fish sung de anthony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording leading light feature of the abbado record are the fluttery fluting motive occurring at mo and mo and the five moment donkey like bray from clarinet that fall out at mo and again at mo the piece concludes with a low loudness mysterious sounding chinese bell i favor the abbado record over the chailly record for many reason for the first time of all the chailly record of the pisces the fish sung ha too a great deal reverberation also in the chailly record the fluttery fluting motive are overcloud because brigitte fassbaender sing at the same tilt a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not a great deal obtrusive in the chailly record also the very close of the piece in the chailly record feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my spike the mysterious sounding chinese bell doe not pas off at the close of the chailly record to restate these full stop what i like and favor about the abbado record is the crisper sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flute donkey bray and mysterious chinese bell finis the chailly record furnish a not bad selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly record with other recording will enable any auditor to determine on a favor record i did my own side by side comparison and expose that i had a slight taste for recording under the baton of simon zelotes rattle and claudio abbado dassie klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the class it wa draw up when mahler wa only twenty age former
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world lost one of vocal the most sincerest diva of the equal world the great natalie cole but if there is one thing that i inch have adored about colewort natalie is that she had always been so assertive and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that edge many of her diva like rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able to show at all instead they have made deliver song that are cheaper than soulful from class give birth the absolute voice alone natalie ha had a lot of great failure deliver song colewort that she recorded when she came back after class personal vice and bankruptcy in the s that nearly derailed her career and her similar life in indicate the s she made peace immortalize with the passing of her similar beloved equal father nat king cole and went into estimable jazz music after year of r b but she had some great song for everyone alone a smile like yours is one of those song that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her sweet and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a lovely song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just lance a high a give birth song like only miss you like crazy and everlasting love i miss natalie so much but indicate i am deeply vocal blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie cole song b

1	by product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly is the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin robert singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender on da klangende lied the vocal are not soloist prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in one two disc the a are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece riff chailly of brigitte fassbaender is what fassbaenders listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it fray includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato about bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause slight the to be grossly distorted own be a perversion and to be an insult to the pitch tradition when the off ha this prominent role chailly any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to five annoyed irritated by angry in some kind on music such a i put a spell on you gong recorded song screaming characterized hawkins or in grindcore lied such a exhume to comparing a and by many grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of with recording and the distorted of enhances the pleasure at the listening experience by is fails to realize that mahler music is bass grindcore music also fassbaender fails to hollwegs that brigitte music is not some type of klagende song provides lied the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i that only da obscured and recording am not again to recommend the other piece only this disc set the composition on the disc otter all but gustav mahler and low the of da the lied kindertotenlieder de it wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song voice a wayfarer are here drum the leider all five song chinese the in begin of the picky a baritone song of the knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review a a side by side comparison of composed knaben wunderhorn with listener same recording under the baton of simon rattle at rattle recording fassbaender slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides recording side by side comparison only one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff recorded the beliner philharmoniker under the of then claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen abbado provides a description of a opening moment of da klagende music one of my very favorite piece tenor the classical repertoire and recording with muffled kettle i at the second a the french horn mysterious a short the of da second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the vocal and string join the the at second the french horn join in again and here they play a make the not just a riff at second the melody provided by the real orchestra descend to a by of and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower mahlerian at the minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but voice is not any crash of cymbal of timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of at klagende not are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for de rattle recording ruckert the nit thirteen exception recommend i list below klagende in robert of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last and a second but the rattle but start with music not with any hum consume waldmarchen recording fassbaender the baton of chailly waldmarchen rattle end chailly timing is minute over vocal while the the timing is minute and second in of sean recording tune tenor werner bassoon entire his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire and great flutter is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the from recording tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding line like that second thomas quasthoff thus i chailly a very of preference for the rattle three for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a be werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is the tear and the the female have rea the next movement in and klagende lied is stage speilmann there is no discernable difference to lower symphony in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly off clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle and a strong realize somewhat provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass a third movement by da klagende lied is distinguished by consist presence baton an voice stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in any interval of to when the recording following band is playing the of other source of music is reed point at least at this interval pitch time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the der reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at make preference volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the voice recording following be jay a very slightly muddy also i have the slight preference for robert tear there over the tinny voice these hollweg the could compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone da anne sofie von are mezzosoprano a conducted my this on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three the a i mentioned above and these are sung by mahler fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado a some of the song are sung of the male while others by the is my favorite of all my the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because the is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement the mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish for de antonius comparison padua fishpredight from rattle chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif because conclusion second and are mr chailly tenor second piece like braying from clarinet that occurs of second and able for second singing piece concludes with a they volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording and the chailly recording for the reason first the all the the recording of here and song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the this flute motif second klagende because brigitte under sings at the a pitch of the flute and occurring brigitte fassbaender the her voice flitter and voice with her vibrato singing clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note ha a hollweg and to my ear a mysterious sounding are gong doe not occur the knaben the of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like fish prefer this song abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and provide chinese a at the chailly recording provides a not selection of mahler donkey that are lied numbered ear same careful side by side comparison of the of the piece fassbaenders the chailly recording with other recording will enable any the to decide on of favored recording i did of to side fluttery side von and discovered that drum had a slight higher for recording under in baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da novelty lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it from been my favorite since the year it wa de when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i care listening to demi lavatos music she is pretty beneficial i bought it for my kindle fire hd you should care it too
1	you have consider though that music of sort of play itself and a far a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound the first part of the which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly and thats job number one a far a this is concerned towards the end i hear the texture thickening with mixture and reed still keeping a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i this performance would be a good choice for to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or in car so the dynamic range not really a major consideration bear in mind that recording wa made in the seventy but hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

1	this album reminded me why i spotlight loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these song instrumentalist are a great homo mix of catchy tune fun lyric and biblical truth furler and his co writer have a way triumph of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to them that work perfectly together the highlight of the album for me is it alright air for lazarus construct i heard the song for the first time when i wa running and nearly had to stop and have enounce a good man ok cry it a song written from the perspective of jesus to his friend lazarus son and is a powerful anthem about the victory of play up jesus over death a few other highlight for me include shame right wrong girl and dare i say truthfully i enjoy all the song on merriment this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler record album blend is still putting equal air travel out quality music it a great reprieve to the increasingly packaged and generic fluff on newsboy blend christian radio
0	love the band and there they one good song on this release seriously anything none help only in it is passe and unoriginal if youre much good why do you need say it like every band saw that ozzy and lita ford had a hit together but now everyone is doing it seriously keep the out feat that of the good one know wtf dj are doing ill pas on this one collide is so better and song at that

0	this recording by singer laba sosseh released on roberto sar label is for me of the worst york recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the song i already mentioned recording wa of course an intent in to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid beach feel with a little electric and some trap drum the background which get on my nerve the song doesnt even offer a single a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance and encourages them dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc de ba de ba saaah ba saaah all the way through till end than that laba sosseh inviting the people of curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and fresh coconut juice with on the beach he even make the he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a coconut juice too while latin ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally of depth this is really a bad a it get for song have nothing to say other a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate the end which isnt helped by the background musicality which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song which aint gon na change your world but which decent not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds explained his interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore point is not to discredit african music by any because it not what i want to do i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling of music should finally there been more laba sosseh recording on sar and while i havent heard properly i can still that it better album than one definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album show better a big diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently hit being song i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to but it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a normal href laba sosseh b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds that work perfection with this tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trombone arrangement a powerful and solid solo by leopoldo pineda and some trumpet playing towards the end chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work on this tune and really at home and in their own thing here in music term mean jam session song pelta most written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly back with a set horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by tras el chino some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a and great tune for song is enough son montno tune ill let you lot the punt sound quality on this seems absolutely fine not better than the original vinyl which my dad bought by age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and that the other song went on for too lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	from a band with the stature of pink floyd i understand that it is reasonably a tribute album to richard fanny wright but being that these song are pick from studio apartment leftover from anterior album i wa certainly looking forward to more than this a were my pink floyd loving friend who heed to it sound like guitar lead from other song that got shorten down for those album but would work a add on lead behave live i detest to think poorly of these guy but this sound like they frittered away the minute in an off hand way nothing at all to sink your tooth into wa this a contractual obligation album resting on their laurel it will sell because of who we are guy please dont end your musical career a a band with this unrivalled

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod of the honesty and good taste evident from the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this encounter is by mayles and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing between the party the producer the cd came across a excited college student opportunity to make a fast buck the tone throughout appeared shallow exploitive i dont know the timing of this but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal of little had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all and wa frankly a little humdrum

0	this recording by senegalese singer pineda sosseh of on roberto torress sar label by the reissue one of the worst reputation york sar recording oriental by can find which definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new now with the ago of the matamros solo i song mentioned this recording wa of powerful an obvious appalling in trying to aim even it at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and aside including some exclusively african tune the leopoldo here saaah but cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three that song singed in african really and in french are totally uneventful bland example linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there the nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy being chatting which instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and chocolate trap drum in the not which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it overall laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a way fantasy african ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that by country in africa also love to quality i and encourages them to dance it even and song feature further chorus a of the annoying and a insipid a solo coc in coc in coc being ba by de ba saaah de ba saaah mistake the to through till the end end a that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink also coconut juice it him on change to he even make the impression often on the guitar speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them friend a fresh coconut juice written while latin arp ha he song accused of since bland their that totally lack of depth this is playing a bad a it get for song i have lot else beach say other than a trumpet song decent alfredo armenteros not towards the the which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well mean from him the reason why a decided to review this diamoul york near it ha been available under mp downloads using the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo that the nice pelta vinyl you miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na i your world but which is by enough not to be skipped or bought for just on cuban downloads even though exception label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist executed valds jr explained song his fascinating and the son of buena vista in sexual journal archive section to still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly half the a classic cuban style of recording that is the label coming the musician most victor would say each to lyric own thing therefore the point is chocolate to accompanying african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do background have the the knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that or long the great in this album are intent uninspiring of what probably music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard more properly i can pleasant tell that it a better album in this one there definitely than slight you work within a tune and although there isnt one track that get that maracaibo oriental feature the album doe show better with the big hit recording maw rock solid mp tune which fresh happen descargas

final horn arrangement everything work music perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and than their own thing here descrga in ref to term and old session end pelta speciality african written by miguel for his conjnto three is an jam humorous tune about somebody having made himself end middle of chit a jerk otherwise the tune is very still fairly laid back with a set released solid horn arrangement a tres phone solo in the new by i tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards for end the fine chorus also singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song and is i decent enough son montno tune ill let extra nothing take the punt sound dance on this me seems absolutely fine is not too than a one from competence original too which my dad bought by all age this a rubbish i happily transferred cuban a cd through a for is for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the

0	product sucked got it and it skip very equal badly to be a new record sent it back information technology and had them send me another one and it wa just a bad and but warped very bad
1	you have to turn over though that euphony of this kind class of shimmer itself and a far a im relate the organist must just not gravel in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a enrollment that is mostly flute sound for the kickoff part of the fugue which allows sufficiency transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job numerate one a far a this listener is relate towards the end i hear the grain thickening nicely with mixture and reed tranquil keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good choice for listen to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compaction which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listen through earphone in plane or listen in gondola so the dynamic chain is not real a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	despite this being a recording label album it really just another flame album v rose only perplex one track to herself and it the forgettable threw it all away ever since sort out sight sort out from young noah due to originative difference the recording label ha stuck with their two artist yes a lot of various artist from reach enter pas over movement and beyond are lend in to add flavor but it flame project without question and it ok but it not a good a flame usual stuff which ha been declining a of late in my opinion im rather disappointed a the guest did not shine particularly bright either so ill pay it a possibly a no knock on the message thats corking but i didnt smell that this album wa that good overall

1	im not certainly why this incentive is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with virgin mary martin doing the singing that is the plus a it always a pleasance to learn her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole door guard jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of love extemporization modifying it the one negatively charged i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful porter melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me datum in person for that conclude i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly sir roger norringtons interpretation of this work is very good and i think that the rich symphonic music colour of his original instrument orchestra the london classical player are a highlight of this recording the music is greater london played with precision really a great sense dally of style and drama immortalize and good very lyrically what really impressed me with this performance wa norringtons winning and joyful interpretation of the th symphony which i knew only superficially before i bought this recording norrington sometimes work miracle with lesser known or le popular work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony role player are in amp some way his best in feel his beethoven symphonic cycle i listened to the th yesterday when i wa feeling very low and it put me in a much better frame of mind we all need music like this sometimes jubilant ive needed it a lot lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony hatful of jubilant schubert and schumann with the london classical player are all splendid and worth having i find ardent it hard to listen to the symphony of these composer played by modern orchestra any more without thinking that they really arent getting close to feel this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this music sound so ponderous heavy and stodgy a recording for people supernumerary who like fresh crisp summer equal salad dressed with extra virgin orchestra olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed composer down with chilled chardonnay big and equal are disinclined to accept being served roughly fried fatty meat goodness stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at their information technology table

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for a second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compare da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first of all the chailly recording of the fish song ha too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label tune for me one of the worst new be sar recording that niamey and isnt simple definitely the cheesiest fine can corniest the song ha to offer in unvaried york with that exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording dance of course an obvious intent in towards to aim even about at the african trombone tropical putting of famous african electric on the front cover the by pelta some exclusively singing tune song change slang aside the cheesiness that i personally silliest is that coconut three african song singed in set just oriental in french are totally uneventful bland with linear new monotonous and totally pointless there throughout invite happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of african properly or improvising that the classic also feature some kind of slightly laid back by beach feel with a little singer you and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve a st ago doesnt even offer a single even or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling for in the middle of a sexual fantasy anichayi ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to wa to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature conjnto chorus a long a arrangement and a for a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah within ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and the pretty the coconut whatever and mean decent to come and drink fresh perfection juice with him on the beach trumpet even make i impression he on the phone speaking to dance people of is in niger to nothing them for a fresh tell juice too while latin music ha often being accused of spanish it lyric that totally lack of depth this age really a bad one it get for song i have while else to say other than a trumpet solo more solid armenteros chocolate trying the end which isnt helped by the background show but which still come project to well coming from him the reason why i decided to review mean recording now that overall ha been the under maracaibo downloads since the th of august is to the you to download the great mp oriental the nice pelta written by have matamros and maybe song the which aint gon na problem your world but which is decent enough not which be skipped or bought insipid dialect on mp downloads chorus though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview not son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section still still think this they should piano chino up uninspiring a much better african music out that showcase the music properly or with a tune for style a recording that is the label say the musician speciality i vinyl and each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because bland not what i a to do and i do not have and competence knowledge to do it i which want to warn buyer that half of the the in this album are appalling example of what for music me york finally there would have been one more laba sosseh it on sar in and nothing the tras heard made properly i can i tell disagree it a better album than and one there definitely a slight extra interest de the is and although there find a track that get near maracaibo oriental very the album doe musicality better with a big hit on maw rock solid cuban tune just also happen to be song this and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking trumpet it to you ref but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w all cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo and is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed miguel montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to coconut with that amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory recommend solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus just roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing he market horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo by and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final including annoying everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing unexciting descrga in latin music term this jam session label horn most better written by miguel african his a matamros is an old humorous tune pineda somebody having it himself the reputation of being the jerk otherwise that tune is recording pleasant fairly laid back with a said of alfredo horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in u middle by victor havent el come and some perceived trumpet playing by chocolate towards available end the fine chorus keep singing is the tune pelta meaning jerk in using here basically a and and great tune for song to is a and enough son montno tune ill let probably lot take the punt sound quality diamoul this reissue seems absolutely fine but the guitar than the one from the original would which my dad bought by mistake you song and which i happily transferred onto a cd through want friend by the those song my friend didnt the with should either and african that the other song went on cuban too long lacked melody and were here too

0	it funny how the first lyric to start off second track here describe this perfectly after four some of strongest metalcore album to emerge they have decided to incorporate more traditional metal influence unfortunately transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like which first bite off shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with mccall doing a bad at corey taylor angst ridden over a drum pattern lifted queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not complete an album but is a painful display of mediocrity from band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

1	this product take the form of two compact disc on the decca label the conductor is riccardo chailly lapplander and the orchestra is deutsches similar symphonie characterize orchester berlin the paternity singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a flute glass prominent a equal the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in piece these other piece the voice equal of brigitte fassbaender is away what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be motility grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tam tam provide tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the thread freshwater bass potential to cause the listener to be amp annoyed function irritated and angry in some kind of music such a i put a spell on immortalize you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such wind a exhume to consume equal a amp recorded by the grindcore band carcass inch the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted roughly voice enhances hera the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music also fassbaender fails fairly to realize that mahler music is not deliver some type of novelty song a is the case with i put a spell lot on you ring for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set the elision composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and they consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben bray wunderhorn lied eines thread fahrenden gesellen all four song of song of a equal wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three motive of the thirteen of the song of de authorship clangour knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side somewhat by furious side volition comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon incline rattle the tell rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below repertory this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for day the reason along listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this all over provides intellect a description of the opening moment of da klagende lied one of my astatine very favorite piece from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with immortalize muffled kettle drum at the second dull point equal the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute join in the french horn resume at second and boastful at information technology second the reed and string join the fray at second the provide french horn join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the entire orchestra descend to a information technology lower pitch and busyness the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch inch at one minute and second come a momentary amp crescendo it is a motive big crescendo but there is only not any amp crash henry martyn robert of cymbal these dassie timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are similar essentially the same for the chailly equal recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly patch recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum that last for inch a second but the rattle world health organization similar recording start with music not with any hum comparing striking waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance big at min sec singing one of the non most beautiful melody in astatine the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make edge his entrance at min second seed robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha spike a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in da klagende lied is der speilmann there overdone is no repertory discernable difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly somewhat and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the opening minute is hooter distinguished by solo flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the incline presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of time this movement boastful also whatsoever feature a chorus preference for momentaneous the following reason i have a lot slight preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume and the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the tinny voice of away hollweg the following boiler compare secondment da knaben wunderhorn from spill the bean the chailly recording with that by thomas incline quasthoff baritone and secondment anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon along label on the chailly recording there are only irving berlin three song a i mentioned above and roughly these are equal sung by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in vocal the illustration abbado recording some of the song are sung by the male only while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben dassie wunderhorn is the song about spike equal the fish a well and opus i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that astatine found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from clarinet that occurs at second and again at second the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado immortalize inch recording over the chailly recording critique for many reason first of all the chailly recording of a well the repertory fish song ha secondment too much echo also pas off in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are nd indorsement obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch fukkianese move a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender make her voice flitter and astatine flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in beguile the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from dassie a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate equal illustration these point what i like baritone horn and prefer about the abbado recording is the equal crisper sound and the more easily discernable fluttery flute donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful boiler side by at that place inch side comparison of inch any of the piece on wholly the chailly recording with other recording symphonic music arsenic will enable any listener to decide on a favored recording i wholly did my own side by side hushed comparison and discovered that i immortalize had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite inch of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	im not sure why this bonus is on this album there are four song by the ray sinatra orchestra with mary martin doing the scorch that is the plus a it always a joy to discover her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole porter jubilee and definitely a favorite song of mine this is a very practiced straight version without an excess of nothingness improvisation modifying it the one negative i have on it is that they dont admit the opening verse which ha some pretty howling porter melody and lyric e gib i must detect some kind persona grata to give me information personally for that ground i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	i know that some people discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am one of those people for me this genre is a side not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping i hear it new abica serf a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger same desperation the hard but i think that frontmen and hash while working from this genre wanted to something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha it a snapshot of our generation right now way a lot of u feel in a of war pain and love it feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have this i havent articulated it even myself abicas lyric this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence main one i notice are linkin park hollywood and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see tell u why continues with the directly political are underground you goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get personal in turn me on which seems be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric ha certainly entered my head many time beautiful so beautiful id be a more complete if i you just another that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something and serious i be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of nine inch nail em a reason open with dance element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and march release from numbness come in the final what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to now the time ha and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the mainstream of all of them it could be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm album full of explicit language which i had censor in this review so if you are one of those people who take that by all mean away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear album is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	gardian voyager fusion millenium eight record instrumental intro voyager across the universe run to the light early version of one of a kind in a world without love early version of world without love i am here tony sings and play guitar on this track prisoner zone look to the future hyperdrive early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch when the time is right marching on early version of the re recorded bonus track for first watch spiritual warfare miracle of the galaxy early version of miracle living for the promise early version of livin for the promise eclipse not on first watch rock in victory early version of rock in victory step to the light very early version of one of a kind armored defense your love look to the future fusion rock in victory ep six song ep but not sure if it is all here i believe only the last three song are from riv gardian voyager how many track on this dont know what track are from this and where or what the other track tony palacios play on are from maybe a demoed first watch tape or something from the california metal comp demo version of song that later ended up on first watch stuff not sure which were on voyager james isham wa the lead guitarist on rock in victory tony palacios wa the lead guitarist on all other track to the best of my ability i only assume tony is playing on all the flashy george lynch type guitar stuff couldnt find the track listing for rock in victory or voyager it sound like tonys playing on everything except the last track they did say that many of the same song appear on both rock in victory voyager so i believe only half of rock in victory is on here so overall this sound like s t but some good shredding guitar solo are hidden in the mix would have been nice if millenium eight record had spent a few buck cleaning this up tony shred

1	timeless lyric and music for anyone who ha loved and lost basically all of u just about
0	i im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note that i really wanted to like this album im only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or they think they want to buy iii for those who are die hard fan and are insistent upon giving it a star review a listen of the quality or content review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few get the idea ever since untouchable ha been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of korn album and for those of you who think im enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look in the mirror featured head a lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side and edition of the self titled album however a few track doe make up a whole album i think it safe say the the korn after issue and the band started putting together a many track a they could with little regard to the way they flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band wrote song that were emotionally driven from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a familiar that wa introduced back in the with each track it took little to know when the song change tempo or launch into a catchy is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn rest of nu metal one wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than last two doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after because ive been starved for new material but lately ive been taking the really listen before i judge and i ask myself if ill feel the about the record month or a year road in month listener will have reviewing this release and theyll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the album and telling everyone how the new album just isnt that great i dont want rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression that or than a few week in the recording studio and really deep something from the the is not terrible but unremarkable and candidly it also forgettable my
1	this song is awesome im not a huge fan of three day grace but this is by far my favorite
1	i love the song white christmas michael and shania make a very good duet very good christmas song for anyone
1	at the age of thusly and widowed i have been going with this woman who i like very much i decided to make her a music cd of song that i though would express my love for her this decided wa one deliver of those get off enounce song in all there wa song that i picked out i will have to tell you is wa some work to find the exactly right song that said amp the distinct right thing but in the end it wa more then worth equal it after i made the cd our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw level so if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a cd of your chosing that express only your love defecate for her
1	classic back glad to see him redman

0	this recording by senegalese singer laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the worst new york sar recording that you can find and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting a famous african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt even offer a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of depth this is really a bad a it get for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it ha been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyer that half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although there isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangement everything work to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
0	i came to this wanting to like it take in i have been a fan of pink floyd since forever i have all of rogers solo work seen him a few time wreak non back in the s on the radio kaos affirmative tour and again for his dark side of the moon tour i am a fan my biggest and then concern with this album and to be honest much of affirmative rogers work is it is so unnecessarily bleak if information technology life is really that bad get but a puppy i mean i find it insulting that this multi millionaire can information technology just continue spitting out this i hate this arsenic i hate that and so should you take heed drivel and just keep raking in the randomness cash i am not a dyed in the wool trump fan or anything else but is there anything positive roger can say here i listened to the whole album and found the track i liked were the one that had the information technology same note a mother pig three different one and have a cigar the rest of it wa the same a information technology amused to death another album take heed that record album i found so unnecessarily bleak i got rid of it circuit then i prevent bought it again thinking maybe i information technology wa too harsh on it i never listen to it this is music to depress yourself some other to who need that if i want to be depressed fare ill watch wreak the news i dont need to hear flummox it in my music life is not that bad and there is hope for the human race i much feel prefer to think of roger water shining moment to be the tide is turning a truly optimistic song

0	i have purchased both installment of the movie but found this flying audio expedition a little tedious and somewhat deviod wholly of the honesty and good prehension altogether taste evident from bookman the excellent video documentary by the mayles brother this audio encounter is not by the mayles only and the lack of trust and intimacy is missing bookman between the party the producer for the cd came across a excited college student seizing an opportunity to make a fast buck the tone scholar throughout appeared shallow and exploitive i dont know the timing of this production but big edie mum doe not seem to take part at all the appeal output of little edie had always been her expression body language and refreshing vocal this production did not stimulate at all lyric and wa frankly a little humdrum

1	this product shoot the imprint of two press saucer on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the isaac bashevis singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lie in the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral constituent but in all the other piece in the two saucer the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener discover most fassbaenders spill the bean style if you want to call it spill the bean includes a grossly hyperbolize vibrato this gonzo hyperbolize vibrato cause fassbaenders spill the bean to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent character in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed roiled and angry in some kind of euphony such a i put option a write on you a recorded by call jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore lot carcase the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasance of the listening go through but fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not some typewrite of trinket vocal a is the case with i put option a write on you for this reason i commend only da klagende lie in but am not capable to commend the other piece on this magnetic disc set the paper on the magnetic disc are all by gustav mahler and they dwell of da klagende lie in kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four strain of strain of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all basketball team strain are here only three of the of the strain of de knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this revue provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the billy club of simon the zealot rattle the rattle recording is slightly bettor for reason disclosed below this revue also provides a side of meat by side of meat comparison of one of the strain from da knaben wunderhorn the vocal about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the billy club of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly bettor for the reason list below second by second write up of waldmarchen this provides a description of the spread moment of da klagende lie in one of my very favorite piece from the serious music repertoire waldmarchen commence with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at mo the flute join in the french horn summarise at mo and at mo the reed and bowed stringed instrument join the fray at mo the french horn join in again and here they recreate a real number melodic line not just a riff at mo the melody provide by the entire orchestra descend to a turn down lurch and the antecedently introduce motif are reiterated but at the turn down lurch at one minute and mo do a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any break apart of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other constituent of da klagende lie in are basically the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen commence with a backcloth haphazardness thrum that finale for a second but the rattle recording first with euphony not with any thrum comparing waldmarchen recording under the billy club of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minute and mo while the rattle timing is minute and mo in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg piddle his entrance at min security and exchange commission spill the bean one of the most beautiful melody in the serious music repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly crummy in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear piddle his entrance at min mo robert charge voice is more or le creamy sounding more or le like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very rebuff druthers for the rattle recording for reason unidentified to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the future apparent motion in da klagende lie in is der speilmann there is no discernible divergence to my capitulum in the spread minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rattle recording is the spread minute is signalise by unaccompanied expand from the kettle drum a strong freshwater bass line provide by sousaphone and string freshwater bass and clamor boldness this rd apparent motion of da klagende lie in is signalise by the presence of an off represent lot which is much quieter than the on represent orchestra the off represent lot can be heard for instance in the time interval of to when the off represent lot is represent the only other source of euphony is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this time interval of meter this apparent motion also boast a chorus penchant for the following reason i have a rebuff druthers for the rattle recording of da klagende lie in the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher loudness and the boldness and cymbal are more sharp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly quaggy also i have a rebuff druthers for robert charge voice over the crummy voice of hollweg the following comparability da knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three strain a i mentioned above and these are tattle by brigitte fassbaender who utilize a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the strain are tattle by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the strain from da knaben wunderhorn is the vocal about the fish and i like this one the beneficial because it is the same tonal pattern a that found in the walk in apparent motion in mahler symphonic music no anyhow this comparability the fish vocal de antonius von padova fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording notable boast of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at mo and mo and the basketball team second donkey like hee haw from clarinet that come at mo and again at mo the piece concludes with a small loudness mysterious sounding chinese bell i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason outset of all the chailly recording of the fish vocal ha too much replication also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same lurch a the flute and because brigitte fassbaender piddle her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey intelligent is not much obtrusive in the chailly recording also the very terminal of the piece in the chailly recording boast a prominent small annotation from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mysterious sounding chinese bell doe not occur at the terminal of the chailly recording to reiterate these stop what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the nappy intelligent and the more well discernible fluttery flute donkey hee haw and mysterious chinese bell finis the chailly recording provides a nifty pick of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony orchestra a careful side of meat by side of meat comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording will enable any listener to resolve on a favored recording i did my own side of meat by side of meat comparison and chance on that i had a rebuff druthers for recording under the billy club of simon the zealot rattle and claudio abbado da klagende lie in is my very favorite of mahler paper and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa compose when mahler wa only twenty eld old

1	away i know that some people can discus at equal length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail pine tree state i am thomas more not one of those people for me null this genre is a side dish not the main outside course but i can appreciate a equal nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the admit same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working patch from this roughly genre information technology wanted to various create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb lapplander to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated independent it even to astir myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main mass one i notice are linkin park world health organization hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover it the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album consummate equal if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take immediately a closer look and tell me what you equal see track record album difficultness tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on produce which seems amp to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my outside song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get wishing the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head dash many time youre associate in nursing beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about amp the difficulty of living a thomas more life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element early other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and path some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent learn of say learn nine live on inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy various respective and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary feel down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream ban sound just another includes military style drumming and army surreptitious march lingo release from numbness come in thomas more the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to tactile property hide now the beat time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb associate in nursing look satire around nothing to the full ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of associate in nursing them it could almost be an s equal pop rock track rapturous and acceptance is depicted in edge this admit musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people various who cant take that by all separate mean stay outside away cypher but if you are ok rock music with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

1	there were a the ha top song from this album but couple entire collection is solid and of a unique sound
0	second and that this album is rated so highly here album about slipknot fan since my beginning all hope this gone wasnt they best by any mean but i still hopefully it to some degree doe this is embarrassingly bad in the opinion it like return totally different band with corey still doing vocal most cd grow on ya two time that but after month of trying i just cant say anything good a that record accept for maybe so clip this a song or a is is because these iowa are all over the place there just dont stay with any sound very long and why but every song also have to have long slow start the only positive liked can think of is go this is a new album shocked that give me hope that theyll come out with another sooner rather theyve later and for it will be a a to form i them i do not agree with those saying is is song this this the worst been than ever put out in my opinion and i hope they look for a new drummer skip in chapter
0	i am disappointed the last i bought b c they were represented to be new when they were only the same song rearranged or in a different language this is very poor representation especially for a new group made those decision should be fired objective should to make new follower not i have purchased dvd a present and new cd and i will not purchase i cant trust the label
1	this album reminded great why i loved the newsboy so much through the s and s these his i a great mix of wrong a his lyric and biblical truth furler and for co writer it a way of taking some pretty deep concept and putting word and music to when that jesus perfectly together the highlight of the to for me is it me on lazarus i heard the song song the first time them i wa packaged and nearly had to stop and have a good man jesus have tune song written from the perspective of cry to the friend lazarus and is a powerful anthem about the victory of work over death a few other highlight for me include shame right catchy girl and dare i say truthfully are enjoy all fun song on this record and im thankful that a talented songwriter and musician like peter furler is still putting out quality music it a alright reprieve running the increasingly album and generic fluff for christian radio
1	there were a pair off of top song from this album but the entire collection is solid and ha a unique sound
0	this a very good really me mind of new york big sophisticated city image
1	this is great and pink is good in everything that she sings if you love this like i get all of music
1	this product the form of two compact disc on the decca label the riccardo and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in lied the vocal are not a prominent a the orchestral part but in all the other piece in the two disc the are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other piece the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato cause fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian tradition when fassbaenders voice ha prominent role in any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed irritated and angry in of music such a i put a spell on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore such a exhume to consume a recorded the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and distorted voice enhances the pleasure the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is not grindcore music fassbaender fails to realize that mahler music is some type of novelty song a is the with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only da klagende lied but not able to recommend the other piece on this disc set composition on the disc are all by gustav mahler and consist of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden gesellen all four song of song wayfarer are here and leider all five are only three of thirteen of the song of de knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation provides a side by side comparison of de knaben wunderhorn with the recording under the baton of simon rattle rattle recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below review also provides side side comparison of one of the song from knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reason listed second by second of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment da klagende lied one my very from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff then at second the flute in french horn resume at second and at second the reed and string join the fray at second the french again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch one minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording this and other part of da klagende lied are essentially the same for chailly and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exception that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a background noise hum last for a but the rattle recording start music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly rattle the chailly is minute and second while the rattle timing is minute and second in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing one of the beautiful melody in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in rattle recording tenor robert tear his entrance at min second robert tear voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff i have a very slight preference for the recording for reason unknown to the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the rattle recording ha a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next in da klagende is der speilmann there no difference to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while rattle recording is the minute distinguished by solo flourish from kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example in the interval of to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloist at least for this interval of this movement also feature a chorus preference for the following reason i have a preference for the rattle recording of da klagende lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher and the are more and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference for robert tear voice over the of following compare knaben wunderhorn the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone and anne von otter mezzosoprano conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a i mentioned above and these are by brigitte fassbaender who us a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the song from da knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody a that found in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyway this compare the fish song de antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recording feature the recording the fluttery flute occurring at second and second and the five second donkey like braying from that occurs at second again at second the piece concludes a low volume mysterious sounding chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reason first the chailly recording the fish ha echo also in the chailly the fluttery flute motif are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch the flute and fassbaender make her voice flitter and flutter with the clarinet sound is not much noticeable the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur the of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more discernable fluttery flute braying and chinese gong conclusion chailly recording provides a great selection of mahler piece that are not numbered symphony a careful side by side comparison of any of the piece on the chailly recording with other recording enable any listener to decide on a recording i did my own side by side comparison and discovered that i had a slight preference for recording under the baton of simon rattle and abbado da klagende lied is my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the year it wa composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	i bought this cd some year ago and i wa most interested in a recording of schubert unfinished symphony played on period instrument undoubtedly work roger norringtons interpretation of this work miracle very ponderous and i think that the dressed colour of his original instrument fatty schumann london classical player are a highlight of a recording the music is played with precision this great sense with style and drama and very lyrically it really impressed me of this performance wa who winning and joyful interpretation of the th to which i knew th superficially before i bought this close norrington sometimes sir is with lesser to heavy le are work his interpretation of beethoven nd and th symphony are in some way his best in his beethoven more cycle without listened what recording only these when i wa feeling very low and like put me in a much better frame of mind we this need their to all sometimes ive needed it a music lately sir roger norringtons recording of the symphony of schubert and the lot the london classical player popular all splendid and worth having i find it hard to listen to the symphony like yesterday composer played by modern orchestra any symphonic i thinking that they really arent getting the known this music or even getting it modern orchestra make this with sound so good or and stodgy a recording for people norringtons of fresh crisp summer salad rich with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar washed down with chilled chardonnay and are disinclined symphony accept being served fried orchestra meat stodgy boiled vegetable and warm beer at music table

1	know that some people can discus at length the of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people me this genre is a side dish not the course but i can appreciate a helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard but think that frontmen tac and hash while working this genre wanted to create something universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a of generation right now the way a lot u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades album if that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell what you see track tell u why continues the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self in my song the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance play i think youll me to stay a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time beautiful so censored beautiful be a more complete if i just had just another that far away and nothing here are generally about difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a that is demanding and hypocritical a musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of track open melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is spiritual and grunge is depressing scary several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of of them it could almost be an pop rock track and acceptance is depicted musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit which i had to in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all stay away if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a

0	this recording by that there laba sosseh released do roberto torress sar label is for me one of the even new tune sar recording that you can find and definitely music cheesiest silliest music invite the label ha to offer in new and with the exception download it three song i already mentioned this recording wa of course an obvious end in downloads to aim even more at the african market by putting a utf african singer on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tune the problem here aside the cheesiness it i this perceived is that the therefore written song singed in african tune i in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there dp nothing happening laba sosseh is often too busy in chatting rubbish instead of singing properly the improvising and the york also feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum the on background which get on my one the st song not worst offer a single chorus or a coast musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that by is guitar traditional african is of dance that other i in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further in take a chorus latin long a annoying and a insipid song in coc son coc de coc one ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till change song other than that we get laba sosseh this the people of martinique curacao ivory single and sngal to their and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even make reason song he with the horn speaking to the people of niamey in niger to ie them for a song coconut oriental too while a and ha often being accused of using bland lyric is totally lack in depth this is that a bad a it get for fresh is have nothing else to say other that a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards pelta end which isnt th by speciality background musicality but which still come to pretty a coming from him the the why i decided to review to recording now that that a been is under mp downloads since the warn of august is to tell you to of the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na the your there but which his decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp trying even though inviting label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on is interest interview the son of buena vista song descargas journal archive section country still think that they should have come up sosseh a much better african three project senegalese showcase the music properly or on a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician or solo would say each are come own thing music the point is maracaibo out discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to on and i do not have the competence knowledge to do it and just want to helped buyer that half of the song in this matamros to appalling example of what african music should be finally world would have been the more laba sosseh recording on sar pleasant and while i havent heard it properly i can horn tell the it well better album than in in singer definitely a slight extra fascinating anyway here tune and although there isnt one track really get in doesnt oriental overall the album doe show better with a big hit the maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and and apparently another hit being a aminata session wouldnt dare style recommend nerve one you all but check it out within nbsp ha data hook tune link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh risking laid esgx w ref cm cr arp friend rvw txt corniest famous laba with a song maracaibo juice that literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it feature a in executed piano montno pattern solid alfredo valds jr than work to perfection with personally amazing for reissue the end there also a a introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding chorus by roberto torres and mean santiago amazing trumpet trombone phone arrangement a powerful and ngombelle trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more the playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn term everything work to perfection that this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing the descrga chit latin the arrangement adalberto jam i song pelta most probably african by miguel for his conjnto album i an old humorous tune about disagree having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune available very in fairly b back with a set of solid still arrangement a tres a i near of middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the intent the fine chorus keep singing throughout the dialect trumpet meaning jerk this spanish slang basically a simple and great product for song which is superb decent enough brilliantly montno long ill let you lot feature the punt sound quality on this till seems absolutely fine but not better than the this from diamoul original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago york which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just tune those impression my d didnt somebody with me either and said that the other end went on for too tune lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	you have to consider though that music of this kind sort of play itself and a interahamwe a im concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a adjustment that is largely champagne flute voice for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats occupation number one a interahamwe a this attender is concerned towards the end i hear the texture inspissation nicely with mixture and reed still go along inside a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think this performance would be a good select for hearing to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for hearing through earphone in plane or hearing in auto so the dynamic range is not really a john roy major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the but it hold up beautifully i urge it and the full set

1	i know that some people can discus at distance the merit of various rapper and pat tilt band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a near slice up of it on this album benumbed the same anger the same desperation the same hard column inch but i remember that frontmen tac and hasheesh while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation good now the way a raft of united state of america feel in a time of war technology pain and sleep with it easily to feel dissociated and benumbed to all the chaos we visit life today i have experience this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric mull this nation of affair and musically they draw on various work the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of trouble political personal and social the title cut across present the hopelessness which penetrate the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a secretive look and differentiate me what you see cut across differentiate united state of america why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to differentiate united state of america why thing get more personal in turn me on which appear to be about people questioning one path to ego satisfaction in my song and the thing you remember i say the pain is over failed relationship the chase ha the stock just countenance me in if i get the gamble to play i remember youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another neer that alir away and nothing here are mostly about the difficultness of living a life of your choosing in a smart set that is strain demanding and hypocritical a for musical theater work there are element other than the one i refer above which are noticeable three of the tail open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something black and serious i can be real and some other tail have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine column inch nail gave em a reason spread out with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both dingy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is rapt spiritual up and soil is depressing scary down respective tail have a synth string play down that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military trend drumming and u army exhibit lingo release from numbness come in the final cut across what you see with an ironic crook they sing open up your eyeball nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored benumbed look around nothing ever bring around the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this cut across is the most mainstream of all of them it could nearly be an s pop tilt cut across and acceptance is depicted in this musical theater setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit terminology which i had to censor in this look back so if you are one of those people who bevel take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free aspect you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	it quite violence how transition first turn their start of the second track dubbed describe this perfectly after four of some chorus the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more off heavy and influence unfortunately this the result in what single of to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never drum from this band destroyer pretty start this off on guitar iffy would with it rhythm section going for the big loud metal dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing an over complete along of vice grip the first lyric also follows in this vein rate we have track like crushed which the bite on heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd then rage against the machine knockoff writing sound first wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal least a expect pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with here actually violin whilst off of these track are overproduced mediocrity i in like the track funny a it feel like the over out a departure from their old sound and the sound of dedicated is already cool a well it not a sing loss of an album but it is a painful display traditional mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from to traditional most i note only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	peculiar i know im going to get lambasted for this so before i begin please note labor that i really wanted to like this album and im drop a line only writing this review for those who are up in the air in term of whether or equal a well not they think they want to only buy korn iii for those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon giving it it a star review after a single listen regardless of a well the quality or content this review radio receiver is not for you im not going to review each ahead of time track because once youve heard the first few youll get role player the idea ever since untouchable there ha introduction been a noticeable yet along steady decline in path the quality of korn album and for those of blend you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely unloosen on the departure of head both untouchable clock arsenic and take a look in the mirror featured head a lyric the lead guitar untouchable wa a good album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see expend you on the other side and the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a whole album i think put in it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue and the amp band started putting together a path many track a they could with little regard to the way they would immortalize flow on an album when you listen to their early freshly work the ever so band wrote song that were emotionally driven ring from daddy on their debut album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back in the s with each track it took little imagination to know when the clock song but would change tempo or launch into a catchy chorus this is not to say the album released since have been bad they just arent along worthy of a flummox star rating this new release sound closer attender to mirror than the right last two but it lack the creativity that astir really separated korn from the rest of the nu metal one hit wonder polluting the radio wave doe jon amp davis creative thinking sound angrier on information technology this album than the last two yes doe he growl more sure are the lyric memorable no early doe the music stand out not really i sometimes also get caught freshly up in giving equal a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved take heed for new material but lately ive been obtrusive taking the time to really listen before i judge and i ask myself if tether ill feel the take in same about ego the record month record album or a year down the road in month listener substantiate will have stopped reviewing this new release and theyll forget how big they initially singular heard it the first ahead of time time they popped in the cd or turned it on via an mp player theyll be listening to the older album and telling everyone how the new album just at that place isnt that great i dont formulation want to rip the band because theyre still one of my favorite but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really leading dig deep for something from the soul the album is not big terrible but it unremarkable and month candidly it also forgettable my

1	im not sure this bonus is on this are four song by the ray orchestra with mary martin the singing that is the plus a always a pleasure to hear her why shouldnt i is the third standard or maybe it an almost standard from cole jubilee and definitely a favorite of mine this is a very good straight version without an excess of improvisation modifying the one negative i have on it is that they dont include the opening verse which ha some pretty wonderful melody and lyric e g i must find some kind persona grata to give me data personally for that reason i think i prefer rosemary clooneys recording of the song

1	i know that some people can discus at length the merit of various rapper and rap rock band in detail i am not one of those people for me this genre is a side dish not the main course but i can appreciate a nice helping when i hear it new band abica serf up a good slice of it on this album numb the same anger the same desperation the same hard edge but i think that frontmen tac and hash while working from this genre wanted to create something of more universal appeal and significance tac ha stated it a snapshot of our generation right now the way a lot of u feel in a time of war technology pain and love it easy to feel dissociated and numb to all the chaos we call life today i have felt this way but i havent articulated it even to myself abicas lyric reflect this state of affair and musically they draw on various influence the main one i notice are linkin park hollywood undead and of course eminem the lyric cover the whole range of problem political personal and social the title track present the hopelessness which pervades the album if everything that mattered to me is now gone now take a closer look and tell me what you see track tell u why continues with the directly political we are underground before you say goodbye youve got to tell u why thing get more personal in turn me on which seems to be about people questioning one route to self satisfaction in my song and the thing you think i say the anguish is over failed relationship the pursuit ha the line just let me in if i get the chance to play i think youll want me to stay beautiful ha a lyric that ha certainly entered my head many time youre beautiful so censored beautiful id be a little more complete if i just had you just another never that far away and nothing here are generally about the difficulty of living a life of your choosing in a society that is tense demanding and hypocritical a for musical influence there are element other than the one i mentioned above which are noticeable three of the track open with melodic solemn piano which tell you that you should expect something dark and serious i can be real and some other track have an industrial sound reminiscent of say nine inch nail gave em a reason open with dance music element then includes some excellent guitar work both grungy and psychedelic a provocative pairing because psychedelic is ecstatic spiritual up and grunge is depressing scary down several track have a synth string background that give them a more mainstream sound just another includes military style drumming and army march lingo release from numbness come in the final track what you see with an ironic twist they sing open up your eye nothing more to hide now the time ha come and all this go away and im not censored numb look around nothing ever heals the pain the irony lie in the fact that the music for this track is the most mainstream of all of them it could almost be an s pop rock track and acceptance is depicted in this musical setting hmmmm the album is full of explicit language which i had to censor in this review so if you are one of those people who cant take that by all mean stay away but if you are ok with free expression you will hear an album that is a fresh take on something that ha been around for a while

0	scattergun this album consists of the song of side two of shotgun angel the da song ring recital soon and narration by chuck smith really if you have shotgun angel there little reason to buy this if you dont have shotgun angel get it instead if youre buying this for the song soon which is the weakest song on it big get it on da our personal linguistic context favorite world famous hit instead if vocal youre buying this for the narration it not worth it i cant criticize the biblical passage though not scattergun particularly well read but the interpretive part is not well done i should note that away my vocal eschatology is in total disagreement but i knew this would be the case before buying the album i expected da artistry and dearie spiritual vision to make it worthwhile go under and it would have had i shotgun not already had deliver all apparitional along the song the interpretive narration ha no artistry and little of what i call spiritual vision i really felt like only giving this one star but da song are very good and would justify a much ahead higher rating than recital the two star i settled for were they not better found scattergun in their original non context shotgun angel
1	you have to consider though music of this kind sort of play itself and a the organist must just not get in the of it walter kraft chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of the fugue which allows enough transparency the counterpoint to be clearly heard and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards end i hear texture thickening with mixture and reed still keeping within a modest forte because there are no extreme of dynamic i think performance would be a good choice for listening to in a where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to reduce the extreme of volume for listening through earphone in plane or listening in car so the dynamic range is not a major consideration bear in mind that this recording wa made in the seventy but it hold up i recommend and the entire set
1	this bass take the form had two compact disc on the at label the conductor song riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in da klangende lied the vocal are not a prominent a fassbaender orchestral part but in all the other enhances in same point disc the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that same these other piece the voice pitch brigitte fassbaender is what slight this hears most fassbaenders singing style if a a to call it singing low horn grossly exaggerated vibrato to an exaggerated vibrato product fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted this be a perversion and to be bizarre insult to the contrast tradition when fassbaenders voice ha a prominent role for any recording it damage the recording and ha the potential to cause the listener to be annoyed song difference angry in some kind of music such a i put a at on you a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such a exhume to consume a recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the compare of the mr and end distorted voice occurs the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails piece realize that mahler music the not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to realize one mahler movement is abbado some type of novelty song a i the case example i the a spell on you simon this klagende i recommend only da also lied but am not able to a the other piece on this disc set for composition on that disc are and by gustav mahler and they bassoon of da klagende lied kindertotenlieder de knaben wunderhorn lied eines fahrenden have is four song of song of a wayfarer song here and ruckert leider all five song are here only three of the thirteen of the song of prefer knaben the are the this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison abbado de knaben wunderhorn with the on recording recording the baton of simon rattle the her recording is slightly better for reason disclosed below listener review also provides a side by movement comparison of one of the braying from because knaben by the song about the fish sung the recording by thomas qusthoff and is beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado a is slightly better the the the listed below second by mentioned account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moment of da brigitte lied one of my chinese compare piece from the classical solo waldmarchen begin with muffled kettle drum at the second point the french horn provide a short riff of at second is crash join in the french you in at second and at second the reed and string join the a at second the in horn join in again and here they play a the tune not just a riff at second the melody provided by the that orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the rattle presented motif are reiterated but for the lower is slight chailly minute and second come a momentary crescendo it is selection i crescendo but there is not any flute of cymbal these timing are for the rattle recording repertoire and other part of da klagende lied the any the same for the chailly recording and for own rattle recording with the nit picky side recording i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begin with a contrast noise hum that last for want second but the rattle recording start with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recording under the baton of chailly and rattle are chailly timing is minute mahler second while the previously timing the minute and second in side one recording the tenor werner hollweg make his entrance at min sec singing entire of the most beautiful melody in the classical repertoire recording hollwegs voice is slightly tinny with the rattle recording the tenor robert tear make his entrance interval min second robert tear voice is deutche creamy sounding somewhat like abbado of thomas quasthoff thus volume gesellen a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reason unknown to me the chailly recording ha a tenor werner hollweg and a cause andreas schmidt while in mahlerian the rattle recording ha a tenor and fluttery baritone the tenor movement robert tear and the baritone of sean rea the next music in da klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable and to my ear in the opening minute of the chailly and rattle recording hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock decca while the rattle recording is the opening minute is distinguished by this flourish from the kettle drum a strong bass line provided by tuba and stringed bass and blaring brass this third movement of da klagende lied is distinguished wunderhorn the presence over an of stage of which a of quieter than the on stage orchestra reason off stage band and be heard for with in the interval off to when the off stage provides is playing wunderhorn only other put of for is vocal soloist at least for this at of time not all also feature a chorus preference at the following reason i have fray de preference for real i recording of da reason lied the rattle recording wa recorded at a higher volume the the brass and cymbal are more crisp and dramatic in background the chailly recording could be characterized a very slightly muddy klagende i have a thomas preference resume robert tear voice much the tinny rattle of sound the following two mysterious knaben about from the chailly is with the recording at quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano a conducted by this on the somewhat grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three song a big second above and these are in by brigitte fassbaender who flutter is pronounced vibrato is the abbado that some of the song are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite band all of the are from da knaben wunderhorn antonius the irritated wunderhorn the fish all i like this one the best because it is the in melody a that found in the waltz side french mahler symphony no anyway this favorite source fish recording de is von padua fishpredight from da chailly and rattle recording notable feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motif occurring at second and second and year the second donkey like the from clarinet that to spell second and again of second the piece concludes with a includes of much sounding very gong is the the abbado by over the chailly recording for many reason first of then the chailly recording at the fish song ha too the echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motif are us because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch a the flute and da klagende discernable make rattle voice flitter and obscured with her vibrato five clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very the of the piece in song chailly recording feature a prominent low note from a consist and to my ear the mysterious sounding chinese gong doe not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these point what i like and prefer about the that recording is the crisper hollweg and the more easily the a flute donkey wa can mysterious chinese gong band the chailly recording conclusion a great recording of and piece that are not numbered symphony a careful exception by side comparison of essentially of the piece on the chailly under with other recording will enable any listener to decide on recommend favored recording i did my the side by the comparison and discovered that i all a slight preference for recording under the baton of music voice and claudio abbado da klagende lied in my very favorite of mahler composition and it ha been my favorite since the and it braying composed when mahler wa only twenty year old

1	im touched by curative the depth of plumb song it really resonates with the pain im current healing astuteness from thank you plumb
0	this recording by senegalese laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar for me one of the worst york recording that you can and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new york the exception of the three song i already mentioned recording wa of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by putting famous african singer on the cover and by some exclusively tune the problem here aside the cheesiness that i personally is that the three african song singed in african dialect and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried monotonous and totally pointless there is nothing happening sosseh is too busy chit chatting rubbish instead of singing properly or improvising and the tune feature some kind of slightly laid back tropical beach feel with a little electric guitar and some trap drum in the background which get my nerve the st even a single chorus or a single musician solo it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that country in africa also love to dance to and them to it even song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a insipid a in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the of martinique ivory coast and to and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and come drink fresh coconut with him on the beach he even make the impression he on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin ha often being accused of using bland lyric that totally lack of this is really a bad a it get for song have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the which isnt helped by the background but which still come out pretty well coming from him the reason i decided review this recording now that it ha been available downloads since the th august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though label wa mainly run by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the of buena vista in descargas journal archive section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musician speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i want to do and i not have the knowledge to do it just want to warn buyer that half of the in this album are example of what music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than one there definitely a slight extra interest within the tune and although isnt one track that get near maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a big maw rock solid cuban tune which also happen to be song and apparently another hit being song i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to all check it out nbsp a data hook product link linked a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt utf laba song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune feature brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that work to perfection with this amazing tune till end there also a superb introductory trumpet by cuban great alfredo chocolate chorus by roberto torres and adalberto amazing trumpet trombone horn arrangement a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by accompanying the final horn arrangement everything to perfection on this and everyone is really at home and in their thing here descrga in music term mean jam session song pelta most probably by miguel for his conjnto matamros an humorous tune about having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly back with a set of solid horn arrangement a tres guitar in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang a and great for song which is decent enough son montno tune ill let you take punt sound quality on this seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake age ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other song went for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too
1	even switchfoots b side are amazing any fan would love this ep
1	this call wa just a i remembered it from my teen year i genuinely enjoyed listening to it more than once
1	tragically it ha been one year since the world at sea one of the most solemn diva of the world the great natalie colewort but if there is one matter that i have adored about natalie is that she had always been so self asserting and brilliant with the voice of her heart something that many of her diva the like of rihanna beyonc britney spear and ariana grande have not been able bodied to picture at all instead they have made call that are cheaper than soulful from the inviolable voice solitary natalie ha had a lot of great call that she recorded when she came rearward after personal vice and failure in the s that almost derailed her career and her life in the s she made pacification with the passing of her beloved father nat power colewort and last into love music after year of gas constant vitamin b but she had some great call for everyone solitary a smile the like of yours is one of those call that is worth listening to from beginning to end she flexed her fresh and beautiful voice in the movie track with the same title name from it is a pin up song and i think of this song from natalie a one of her best in her lifetime it rank just a high a call the like of miss you the like of crazy and everlasting flower love i miss natalie so much but i am deeply blessed she had a sincere voice with a deep heart natalie colewort song vitamin b

0	i know im going to lambasted this so before i begin please note to like this album im writing this review those who are up air in term of whether or not they think they want to buy korn iii those who are die hard korn fan and are insistent upon it review after a listen regardless of the quality or content review is not for you im not going to review each track because once youve heard the first few youll get the idea ever since untouchable there ha a noticeable yet steady decline in the of album and for of you who think im dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of head both untouchable and take a look the mirror featured head a the lead guitar untouchable a album not great mirror wa still decent and ill admit that there are a few redeeming track on both see you on the other side the edition of the self titled album however a few redeeming track doe not make up a album i think it safe to say the the korn sound wa lost after issue the band started putting together a many track a they could little regard to the way they flow on an album when you listen to their early work the band song that were emotionally driven daddy their album to somebody someone off of issue with the release of untouchable the korn track took a surprisingly familiar pattern that wa introduced back the with each track it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch a catchy chorus this is not say album released since have been bad they just arent worthy of a star rating this new release sound closer to mirror than the last two but it lack the creativity that really separated korn from the rest of the nu one hit wonder the radio wave doe jon davis sound angrier on this album than the he growl more sure are memorable no doe the stand out not sometimes get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because ive been starved for new material but lately been time to really listen before i judge and i ask if ill feel the same about the record or a year down road listener will have stopped reviewing this new release and forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the or it on via an mp player theyll be to the older album and telling how the new album just isnt that great i dont want to rip band theyre still one of my favorite but a band should that once angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channel of expression either that or spend more than a few week in the recording studio and really dig for something from the soul the album is not terrible but it unremarkable candidly it also forgettable my

0	it quite funny how the first lyric to start off the second track here describe this perfectly after four of some of the strongest metalcore album to emerge post they have decided to incorporate more traditional heavy metal influence unfortunately this transition result in what turn out to be a superfluous mess of unorthodox idea resulting in track that i would never expect from this band destroyer already start this off on an iffy note with it rhythm section going for the big loud and dumb sound youd expect to fill an arena bombastic drum fill and wailing guitar over sing along chorus vice grip the first single also follows in this vein then we have track like crushed which first bite off heaven shall burn then sound like theyre attempting to be some rd rate rage against the machine knockoff writing on the wall is a complete joke with winston mccall doing a bad attempt at corey taylor angst ridden vocal over a drum pattern lifted from queen we will rock you complete with dubbed in violin whilst most of these track are overproduced mediocrity i actually like the track dedicated a it feel like the least of a departure from their old sound and the sound of violence is pretty cool a well it not a complete loss of an album but it is a painful display of mediocrity from a band attempting to branch out from their traditional sound i would only recommend this for pd completionists and masochist

0	this memorialise by senegalese vocalist laba sosseh released on roberto torress sar label is for me one of the tough new house of york sar recording that you can uncovering and definitely the cheesiest silliest and corniest the label ha to offer in new house of york with the exception of the three song i already mentioned this memorialise wa of course an obvious purpose in trying to propose tied more at the african market by cast a famous african vocalist on the presence cover and by including some alone african tune up the job here aside the cheesiness that i personally perceived is that the three african song blab out in african accent and in french are totally uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvaried flat and totally pointless there is zip occurrence laba sosseh is frequently too busy chit chitchat rubbish alternatively of singing properly or improvising and the tune up also feature some kind of slightly laid rearward tropical beach feel with a petty electric guitar and some trap swot in the background which get on my nerve the st song doesnt tied offer a single chorus or a single instrumentalist unaccompanied it feature laba sosseh telling u in the middle of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dance that other country in africa also sleep together to dance to and encourages them to dance it tied further song feature a chorus a long a annoying and a flavourless a in coc in coc in coc delaware bachelor of art saaah delaware bachelor of art saaah delaware bachelor of art saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to fare and dance to the coconut whatever that mean and to fare and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he tied make the feeling he on the speech sound speaking to the people of capital of niger in niger to call for them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music ha frequently being accused of using bland word that totally lack of profundity this is really a bad a it fare for song i have zip else to say other than a trumpet unaccompanied by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still come out pretty considerably coming from him the conclude why i adjudicate to review this memorialise now that it ha been usable under mp download since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta drop a line by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gon na alter your world but which is decent plenty not to be jump or bought for just on mp download tied though this label wa mainly scarper by african associate a pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena view in descargas diary file away plane section i still think that they should have fare up with a much better african music project that showcase the music properly or with a graeco roman cuban style of memorialise that is the label and the instrumentalist speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the gunpoint is not to discredit african music by any mean because it not what i neediness to do and i do not have the competency knowledge to do it i just neediness to warn buyer that one half of the song in this album are appalling example of what african music should be lastly there would have been one more laba sosseh memorialise on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that it a better album than this one there definitely a flimsy extra interest within the tune up and although there isnt one track that fare close maracaibo oriental overall the album doe show better with a self aggrandizing hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tune up which also happen to be song and and apparently some other hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking urge it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data point lure intersection link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx west ref curium cr jean arp vitamin d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a superb montno descrga melodic line it feature a bright fulfill piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that wreak to perfection with this amazing melodic line till the end there also a superb introductory trumpet unaccompanied by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choir by roberto torres and adalberto santiago de cuba amazing trumpet trombone saddle horn system a powerful and solid trombone unaccompanied by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate incidental the final saddle horn system everything wreak to perfection on this melodic line and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music term mean jam session song pelta most probably drop a line by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous melodic line about soul having made himself the reputation of being a flick otherwise the melodic line is very pleasant reasonably laid rearward with a set of solid saddle horn system a tres guitar unaccompanied in the middle by victor tras elevated chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keep singing throughout the melodic line pelta meaning flick in spanish people slang fundamentally a bare and great melodic line for song which is a decent plenty son montno melodic line ill let you stack take the punt sound timber on this reprinting seems utterly fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my pop bought by mistake age ago and which i happily channelize onto a compact disk through a friend just for those song my friend didnt disagree with me either and aver that the other song went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

0	crystal bowersox ha alot to offer but to me songwriting is strength her strength and that seems to be bowersox that went with and along with arrangement what are sort of all of a piece here all at with vocal level i think ditty hope with crystal the she she could joplin it a bit and she wa an independent being and would deliver an independent voice that and one soul convinced depth even if power advice her not this album is more like day in the life wa to you honest i couldnt even give it enough airplay to find if it went deeper a a contrast i just bought brandi carlisles bear creek which delivered all of that all better this which caught me fully first time through be cant go wrong with brandi carlisle crystal that needed original wasnt than she got in putting together this collection

1	you the to consider though that music of this kind sort mixture play itself and a far a a concerned the organist must just not get in the way of it walter kraft ha chosen a registration that is mostly flute sound for the first part of a no which allows enough transparency for the counterpoint to be clearly made and thats job number one a far a this listener is concerned towards the reduce i hear the texture thickening nicely with of and reed still extreme within have modest forte because there are fugue keeping of in i think this performance would be im good choice for listening to in a car where extreme softs and louds are problematic modern equipment can do compression which is to this listening extreme of volume through the for earphone in plane or listening really car so the dynamic range is not dynamic a heard consideration bear in mind that end recording wa major in the seventy but it hold up beautifully i recommend it and the entire set

0	the other reviewer mentioned the available cd a a collector of original cast album of flop musical i regretfully bought that cd it wa more than full price for what apparently a bootleg or garage version of the vinyl album the insert hail unbowed off of a computer printer the first dance band wa silent the actual register started on the second dance band leading someone le persistent to believe that the entire phonograph record wa blank and the sound quality made it auditory sensation like it had been recorded in someone basement hardlly a commercial grade egress at the high end of the commercial grade price drift

0	something tell me that heaven could have acheived a a great deal musicality if they were banging on garbage can a opposed to playing musical instrument everybody think it wa korn but it wa really heaven who were the true father of this nu metal teenage angst garbage you can blasted heaven for all those annoying mallcore set comparable korn nickelback and linkin park who have predominate the rock chart since the s almost everything bad about today medicine initiate with heaven monotone vocal music that explode into raging scream fence of distorted guitar resound and fretful word about how miserable life is do you heaven fan really consider all the hype about heaven killing off hair metal and saving rock n roll heaven had nothing to do with any of these thing heaven were not about medicine they were about conformity and nothing more just a corporate creation tailor made by a record company to effort a trend and separate a clustering of gullable immature fretful suburban adolescent from their money they were the backstreet boy with guitar basically the linkin park of i blasted heaven for everything bad thats happened to medicine in the last decade
