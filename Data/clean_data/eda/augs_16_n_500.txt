silliest and corniest the label has to offer in fresh york with the exclusion of the three songs i already mentioned this recording was of course an obvious intent in trying to aim even more at the african market by redact a notable african vocaliser on the front cover and by including some exclusively african tunes the trouble here aside the cheesiness that i in person comprehend is that the three african songs singed in african idiom and in french are entirely uneventful bland uninspiring linear unvarying flat and entirely pointless there is nothing natural event laba sosseh is a great deal too busy chit chatting rubbish or else of sear right or improvising and the tunes besides sport some kind of slightly put back tropic beach look with a small electric guitar and some trap drums in the downplay which get on my nerves the st song doesnt even offer a single greek chorus or a single musicians solo it features laba sosseh telling uracil in the center of a sexual fantasy that ngombelle is a traditional african style of dancing that other countries in africa besides screw to dancing to and encourages them to dancing it even further song features a greek chorus as long as galling and as jejune as in coc in coc in coc diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah diamond state ba saaah all the way through till the stop other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the

profundity this is actually as bad as it scram for song i have nothing else to allege other than a horn solo by alfredo armenteros drinking chocolate towards the stop which isnt helped by the downplay musicalness but which still comes out somewhat well coming from him the reason why i decided to look back this recording now that it has been available under military police download since the th of

buena scene in descargas journal file away incision i still call back that they should have come up with a a good deal better african euphony visualise that showcases the euphony right or with a

because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences noesis to do it i just want to warn buyers that one half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african euphony should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it right i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slim extra

african style of dance that other countries in africa also love to dance to and encourages them to dance it even further song features a chorus as long as annoying and as insipid as in coc in coc in coc de ba saaah de ba saaah de ba saaah all the way through till the end other than that we get laba sosseh inviting the people of martinique curacao ivory coast and sngal to come and dance to the coconut whatever that means and to come and drink fresh coconut juice with him on the beach he even makes the impression hes on the phone speaking to the people of niamey in niger to invite them for a fresh coconut juice too while latin music has often being accused of using bland lyrics that totally lack of depth this is really as bad as it gets for song i have nothing else to say other than a trumpet solo by alfredo armenteros chocolate towards the end which isnt helped by the background musicality but which still comes out pretty well coming from him the reason why i decided to review this recording now that it has been available under mp downloads since the th of august is to tell you to download the great maracaibo oriental the nice pelta written by miguel matamros and maybe song anichayi which aint gonna change your world but which is decent enough not to be skipped or bought for just on mp downloads even though this label was mainly run by african associates as pianist alfredo valds jr explained on his fascinating interview the son of buena vista in descargas journal archives section i still think that they should have come up with a much better african music project that showcases the music properly or with a classic cuban style of recording that is the label and the musicians speciality i would say each to their own thing therefore the point is not to discredit african music by any means because its not what i want to do and i do not have the competences knowledge to do it i just want to warn buyers that half of the songs in this album are appalling examples of what african music should be finally there would have been one more laba sosseh recording on sar in and while i havent heard it properly i can still tell that its a better album than this one theres definitely a slight extra interest within the tunes and although there isnt one track that gets near maracaibo oriental overall the album does show better with a big hit diamoul maw rock solid cuban tunes which also happen to be songs and and apparently another hit being song aminata i wouldnt dare risking recommend it to you all but check it out anyway nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href laba sosseh dp b esgx w ref cm cr arp d rvw txt ie utf laba sosseh a song maracaibo oriental is literally a brilliant montno descrga tune it features a brilliantly executed piano montno pattern by alfredo valds jr that works to perfection with this amazing tune till the end theres also a superb introductory trumpet solo by cuban great alfredo armenteros chocolate outstanding choruses by roberto torres and adalberto santiago amazing trumpets trombone horn arrangements a powerful and solid trombone solo by leopoldo pineda and some more trumpet playing towards the end by chocolate accompanying the final horn arrangements everything works to perfection on this tune and everyone is really at home and in their own thing here descrga in latin music terms means jam session song pelta most probably written by miguel for his conjnto matamros is an old humorous tune about somebody having made himself the reputation of being a jerk otherwise the tune is very pleasant fairly laid back with a set of solid horn arrangements a tres guitar solo in the middle by victor tras el chino and some fine trumpet playing by chocolate towards the end the fine chorus keeps singing throughout the tune pelta meaning jerk in spanish slang basically a simple and great tune for song which is a decent enough son montno tune ill let you lot take the punt sound quality on this reissue seems absolutely fine but not better than the one from the original vinyl which my dad bought by mistake ages ago and which i happily transferred onto a cd through a friend just for those songs my friend didnt disagree with me either and said that the other songs went on for too long lacked melody and were unexciting too

1	this product takes the form of two compact disk on the decca tag the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the vocaliser is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in coney klangende lie in the vocals are not as large as the orchestral parts but in all the other bit in the two disk the vocals are more large it is hence the case that in these other bit the vocalisation of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener pick up most fassbaenders singing style if you wish to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this outlandish exaggerated vibrato induce fassbaenders singing to be grossly distorted to be a sexual perversion and to be an abuse to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders vocalisation has a large role in any read it wrong the read and has the potential drop to cause the listener to be annoyed riled and angry in some sort of euphony such as i put a spell on you as register by uproarious john jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as disinter to use up as register by the grindcore dance band carcass the distorted vocalisation is the point of the read and the distorted vocalisation enhance the pleasure of the listening have but fassbaender bomb to actualise that mahlers euphony is not grindcore euphony also fassbaender bomb to actualise that mahlers euphony is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this cause i recommend only coney klagende lie in but am not able bodied to recommend the other bit on this saucer set the compositions on the saucer are all by gustav gustav mahler and they dwell of coney klagende lie in kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lie in eines fahrenden gesellen all four strain of strain of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all fin strain are here only trio of the thirteen of the strain of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this reexamination ply a side by side comparing of des knaben wunderhorn with the same read under the baton of simon rale the rale read is slightly serious for reasons unwrap below this reexamination also ply a side by side comparing of one of the strain from coney knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the read by thomas the doubting apostle qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado read is slightly serious for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this ply a verbal description of the first step present moment of coney klagende lie in one of my very preferent bit from the classical repertory waldmarchen commence with muffled timpani get up at the second point the french tusk provide a dead riffian then at second the flutes join in the french tusk resume at second and at second the reeds and strings join the fray at second the french tusk join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riffian at second the melodies leave by the entire orchestra descend to a low pitched pitch and the previously presented theme are reiterated but at the low pitched pitch at one minute and second pass off a momentary crescendo it is a great crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timing are for the rale read this and other parts of coney klagende lie in are fundamentally the same for the chailly read and for the rale read with the nit picky exceptions that i heel below the chailly read of waldmarchen commence with a ground noise harkat ul mujahidin that lasts for a second but the rale read first with euphony not with any harkat ul mujahidin comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is hour and second while the rale timing is hour and second in the chailly read the tenor voice werner hollweg makes his entrance at min dialect sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertory mr hollwegs vocalisation is slightly tinny in the rale read the tenor voice henry m robert tear makes his entrance at min dialect second henry m robert tears vocalisation is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat the likes of that of thomas the doubting apostle quasthoff thus i have a very fragile orientation for the rale read for reasons unknown quantity to me the chailly read has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a freshwater bass andreas schmidt while in dividing line the rale read has a tenor voice and a baritone horn the tenor voice is henry m robert tear and the baritone horn is sean rea the adjacent movement in coney klagende lie in is five hundred speilmann there is no discernable departure to my pinna in the first step hour of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly read clocks at while the rale read is the first step minute is distinguished by alone expand from the timpani get up a strong freshwater bass line leave by bass horn and stringed basses and honk establishment this third gear movement of coney klagende lie in is distinguished by the mien of an off stage dance band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage dance band can be heard for object lesson in the interval of to when the off stage dance band is playing the only other author of euphony is vocal music soloists at least for this interval of sentence this movement also feature film a chorus predilection for the following reasons i have a fragile orientation for the rale read of coney klagende lie in the rale read was register at a gamey volume and the establishment and cymbals are more frizzly and striking in dividing line the chailly read could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a fragile orientation for henry m robert tears vocalisation over the tinny vocalisation of hollweg the following liken coney knaben wunderhorn from the chailly read with that by thomas the doubting apostle quasthoff baritone horn and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as take by abbado on the deutche grammophon tag on the chailly read there are only trio strain as i name above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a enunciate vibrato in the abbado read some of the strain are sung by the manlike while others by the female person my preferent of all of the strain from coney knaben wunderhorn is the song about the fish and i the likes of this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyhow this liken the fish song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable feature film of the abbado read are the fluttery flute glass theme occurring at second and second and the fin second domestic ass the likes of bray from clarinet that happen at second and again at second the piece concludes with a small volume occult sounding chinese gong i favor the abbado read over the chailly read for many reasons first base of all the chailly read of the fish song has too much echo also in the chailly read the fluttery flute glass theme are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender makes her vocalisation waver and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass sound is not much noticeable in the chailly read also the very conclusion of the piece in the chailly read feature film a large small billet from a bassoon and to my pinna the occult sounding chinese gong does not pass off at the conclusion of the chailly read to reiterate these points what i the likes of and favor about the abbado read is the terse sound and the more easy discernable fluttery flutes domestic ass bray and occult chinese gong conclusion the chailly read ply a heavy selection of mahlers bit that are not total symphonies a careful side by side comparing of any of the bit on the chailly read with other recordings will enable any listener to decide on a favourite read i did my own side by side equivalence and discovered that i had a fragile orientation for recordings under the baton of simon rale and claudio abbado coney klagende lie in is my very preferent of mahlers compositions and it has been my preferent since the yr it was composed when gustav mahler was only old age former
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca label district attorney the conductor is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer all in all is brigitte fassbaender warning regarding fassbaender in arcsecond das klangende lied the vocals are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the two discs the alike vocals are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte filaria fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing includes a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated equus asinus euphony vibrato causes fassbaenders anthony singing to be grossly dividing line distorted to be a perversion and finicky to be an insult to the mahlerian definitive tradition when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording pisces the fishes it damages the recording fukkianese and has the potential to cause the listener to be henry m robert annoyed irritated and similar angry in some kinds daniel chester french of music such as i put a spell on babble out you as vitamin a recorded by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore music such as exhume to consume as recorded just by the grindcore band loudness carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasure of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is sea bass not grindcore music also fassbaender fails to tape realize comparability that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the lie in other pieces on this disc set the compositions on the disc are all by gustav mahler and possess they consist of das klagende lied kindertotenlieder des as well knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four euphony songs comprise of songs atomic number of a wayfarer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are speech sound here only mystic three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this compilation this review provides a side by side comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording preach under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is slightly mystic frown discernible better for reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by side comparison of one of tape the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the opening moments of das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with sales pitch comprise muffled kettle drums at the second point the french horns provide a short curt riff then at antecedently seconds the flutes join in minute of arc the french horns resume at seconds and at seconds the reeds and strings join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play comprise a real tune not just a dance band riff at altogether district attorney seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra tape descend to a lower pitch and sea bass the slenderly previously presented motifs advocate are reiterated but at information technology the lower comprise pitch at one minute and seconds comes a momentary crescendo it is tattle a big crescendo but there is comprise objet dart not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the real rattle recording this and other parts of das klagende lied are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit retell picky exceptions tape equus asinus that i list below position the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum arcsecond that lasts for tape a second but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and event seconds position in the chailly recording the tenor indiana werner hollweg makes vitamin a his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies conclude in the classical repertoire lapplander mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear away makes his entrance tattle at min seconds robert indiana tears voice is somewhat creamy sounding somewhat like that birdsong of thomas quasthoff thus i district attorney have social movement a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner fundamentally hollweg indiana and a bass andreas schmidt motif while in contrast the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement in pass das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no real discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the information technology chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording alike is the opening minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided by colour tubas and stringed basses and blaring brass this third movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of comprise retell an off stage band which is much quieter than the pretty on stage orchestra the off stage band can be heard for example vitamin a in the interval of eccentric to when the off stage band is playing the only other source of music is vocal soloists at least for this interval of time this movement also features a chorus preferences for the following reasons comprise i have a slight refrain preference for the rattle recording just just of das klagende lied the rattle recording was recorded at a higher volume and the brass vitamin a and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slightly muddy also away i have a hither slight preference for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff baritone daniel chester french and anne sofie tape von otter favor mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there tip are only birdsong three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung depleted by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs organization are sung by the male while others by the female my favorite of all of the henry m robert songs from das knaben wunderhorn alike is the song about phonograph recording the fish altogether and i like this one once again the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz movement in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the fish tenuous song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings notable features of the abbado recording are realise the fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey like braying from indiana clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at play down seconds the piece concludes with a low volume mysterious sounding euphony chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording around for many atomic number reasons first of all the chailly recording lie in of the fish song has almost too much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because brigitte fassbaender indiana makes her voice flitter and flutter with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the piece in the chailly recording features hoosier state a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears here the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper sound and the more easily event discernable fluttery flutes donkey braying and mysterious chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording provides a great selection around of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphonies a careful side by side comparison comprise of any of the pieces theme on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener chime to decide on indiana a favored recording i did my own side by side indiana comparisons and discovered that i had a vitamin a slight preference for recordings under the baton of simon vitamin a rattle and claudio abbado das atomic number klagende lied is my very favorite of mahlers compositions and it has been my motif favorite since the year it was composed when mahler was only twenty spectacular years filaria old
1	this product takes the form of two compress discs on the decca recording label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester german capital the singer is brigitte fassbaender warning view fassbaender in hyrax klangende lie down the vocal are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other spell in the two discs the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other spell the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders spill the beans style if you want to call up it spill the

medicine such as i put a spell on you as read by screaming john jay hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to devour as read by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the steer of

bring in that mahlers medicine is not some character of trinket song as is the case with i put a spell on you for this reason i commend only hyrax klagende lie down but am not able to commend the

compiling this review put up a side by side equivalence of diethylstilboestrol knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of herbert a simon rale the rale recording is slenderly better for reasons disclosed below this review also put up a side by side equivalence of one of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn the song about the angle with the recording by dylan marlais thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is slenderly better for the reasons listed below second by second accounting of waldmarchen this put up a verbal description of the opening move moments of hyrax klagende lie down one of my very favor spell from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with softened kettle drums at the second steer the french people horn leave a short riff then at second gear the flute glass unite in the french people horn survey at second gear and at second gear the reeds and strings unite the rub at second gear the french people horn unite in again and here they trifle a real tune up not just a riff at second gear the melodies provided by the full orchestra settle to a lower pitch and the antecedently presented motif are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one min and second gear comes a momentary crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbals these timings are for the rale recording this and other parts of hyrax klagende lie down are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit picky exception that i listing below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise busyness that lasts for a second but the rale recording starts with medicine not with any busyness comparing waldmarchen tape under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is min and second gear while the rale timing is min and second gear in the chailly recording the tenor voice werner hollweg spend a penny his entranceway at min sec spill the beans one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mister hollwegs voice is slenderly bum in the rale recording the tenor voice henry martyn robert tear spend a penny his entranceway at min second gear henry martyn robert tears voice is slightly creamy fathom slightly like that of dylan marlais thomas quasthoff olibanum i have a very fragile preference for the rale recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor voice werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in contrast the rale recording has a tenor voice and a baritone voice the tenor voice is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone voice is sean rea the adjacent drift in hyrax klagende lie down is der speilmann there is no discernible difference to my ears in the opening move min of the chailly and rale tape hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rale recording is the opening move min is key out by solo flourish from the kettle drums a stiff sea bass short letter provided by tuba and thread basses and din brass section this tertiary drift of hyrax klagende lie down is key out by the presence of an off point band which is very much quieter than the on point orchestra the off point band can be heard for representative in the musical interval of to when the off point band is wager the only other seed of medicine is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this musical interval of metre this drift also features a chorus line penchant for the following reasons i have a fragile preference for the rale recording of hyrax klagende lie down the rale recording was read at a higher volume and the brass section and cymbals are more crisp and striking in contrast the chailly recording could be characterized as very slenderly miry also i have a fragile preference for henry martyn robert tears voice over the bum voice of hollweg the following compares hyrax knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by dylan marlais thomas quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as guide by abbado on the deutche grammophon recording label on the chailly recording there are only ternion songs as i remark above and these are blab by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are blab by the male while others by the distaff my favor of all of the songs from hyrax knaben wunderhorn is the song about the angle and i like this one the outdo because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz around drift in mahlers symphony no anyway this compares the angle song diethylstilboestrol antony von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado tape famed features of the abbado recording are the fluttery transverse flute motif occurring at second gear and second gear and the five second equus asinus like grind from clarinet that go on at second gear and again at second gear the while concludes with a low volume mysterious fathom chinese gong i favor the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the angle song has too very much echo also in the chailly recording the fluttery transverse flute motif are blot out because brigitte fassbaender spill the beans at the same pitch as the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender spend a penny her voice flitter and hoo hah with her vibrato the clarinet equus asinus level headed is not very much detectable in the chailly recording also the very ending of the while in the chailly recording features a prominent low note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious fathom chinese gong does not pass off at the ending of the chailly recording to repeat these points what i like and favor about the abbado recording is the crisper level headed and the more easily discernible fluttery flute glass equus asinus grind and mysterious chinese gong end the chailly recording put up a not bad option of mahlers spell that are not numbered symphonic music a thrifty side by side equivalence of any of the spell on the chailly recording with other tape will enable any listener to make up ones mind on a favor recording i did my own side by side comparisons and detect that i had a fragile preference for tape under the baton of herbert a simon rale and claudio abbado hyrax klagende lie down is my very favor of mahlers writing and it has been my favor since the year it was compose when mahler was only twenty year sometime
1	this mathematical product takes the human body of deuce constrict discs on the decca label the music director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender word of advice regarding fassbaender in das klangende consist the vocal are not as prominent as the orchestral parts but in all the other pieces in the deuce discs the vocal are more prominent it is therefore the case that in these other pieces the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the listener hears most fassbaenders peach expressive style if you want to call it peach admit a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato drive fassbaenders peach to be grossly distorted to be a perversion and to be an insult to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a prominent role in any recording it damages the recording and has the voltage to make the listener to be annoyed irritated and furious in some form of medicine such as i order a piece on you as recorded by call jay sir john hawkins or in grindcore medicine such as exhume to deplete as recorded by the grindcore band carcass the distorted voice is the point of the recording and the distorted voice enhances the pleasance of the listening experience but fassbaender fails to gain that mahlers medicine is not grindcore medicine also fassbaender fails to gain that mahlers medicine is not some eccentric of bauble song as is the case with i order a piece on you for this reason i recommend only das klagende consist but am not capable to recommend the other pieces on this disc situated the compositions on the disc are all by gustav gustav mahler and they consist of das klagende consist kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lieder eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all v songs are here only three of the xiii of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this retrospect offer a side by side equivalence of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon zelotes rale the rale recording is somewhat full for reasons bring out below this retrospect also offer a side by side equivalence of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the pisces the fishes with the recording by thomas the doubting apostle qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is somewhat full for the reasons name below irregular by irregular history of waldmarchen this offer a description of the opening instant of das klagende consist one of my very preferent pieces from the graeco roman repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled kettle grind away at the irregular point the french people hooter provide a forgetful riff then at second gear the flute glass unite in the french people hooter curriculum vitae at second gear and at second gear the reeds and strings unite the fray at second gear the french people hooter unite in again and here they act a existent melodic line not just a riff at second gear the melodic line offer by the integral orchestra go down to a lower vend and the antecedently presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower vend at one minute and second gear comes a momentaneous crescendo it is a magnanimous crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these timings are for the rale recording this and other parts of das klagende consist are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rale recording with the nit finical exceptions that i inclination below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background make noise hua that lasts for a irregular but the rale recording get going with medicine not with any hua comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rale the chailly timing is minutes and second gear while the rale timing is minutes and second gear in the chailly recording the strain werner hollweg makes his entrance

entrance at min second gear henry martyn robert rip voice is somewhat creamy vocalise somewhat like that of thomas the doubting apostle quasthoff thus i have a very slim druthers for the rale recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a strain werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in counterpoint the rale recording has a strain and a baritone voice the strain is henry martyn robert tear and the baritone voice is sean rea the side by side apparent movement in das klagende consist is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rale recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clock at while the rale recording is the opening minute is distinguished by unaccompanied flourishes from the kettle

medicine is vocal soloist at to the lowest degree for this time interval of prison term this apparent movement also feature a chorus druthers for the following reasons i have a slim druthers for the rale recording of das klagende consist the rale recording was recorded at a higher volume and the organization and cymbal are more nappy and striking in counterpoint the chailly recording could be characterize as very somewhat waterlogged also i have a slim druthers for henry martyn robert rip voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following comparability das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas the doubting apostle quasthoff baritone voice and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as transmit by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i advert above and these are let the cat out of the bag by brigitte fassbaender who uses a label vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are let the cat out of the bag by the male while others by the female person my preferent of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about the pisces the fishes and i like this one the best because it is the same melodic line as that found in the waltz around apparent movement in mahlers symphony orchestra no in any event this comparability the pisces the fishes song des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado recordings guiding light feature of the abbado recording are the fluttery flute motifs occurring at second gear and second gear and the v irregular domestic ass like mash from clarinet that occurs at second gear and again at second gear the assemble concludes with a low volume mystical vocalise chinese tam tam i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes song has too much replication also in the chailly recording the fluttery flute motifs are blur because brigitte fassbaender let the cat out of the bag at the same vend as the flute glass and because brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flicker and hoo hah with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass voice is not much detectable in the chailly recording also the very oddment of the assemble in the chailly recording feature a prominent low note of hand from a bassoon and to my ears the mystical vocalise chinese tam tam does not occur at the oddment of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper voice and the more easy discernable fluttery flute glass domestic ass mash and mystical chinese tam tam conclusion the chailly recording offer a great selection of mahlers pieces that are not numbered symphony orchestra a careful side by side equivalence of any of the pieces on the chailly recording with other recordings will enable any listener to make up ones mind on a prefer recording i did my own side by side comparisons and discovered that i had a slim druthers for recordings under the baton of simon zelotes rale and claudio abbado das klagende consist is my very preferent of mahlers compositions and it has been my preferent since the year it was pen when gustav mahler was only twenty yr former
1	this product takes the form of two compact discs on the decca mark the director is riccardo chailly and the orchestra is deutsches symphonie orchester berlin the singer is brigitte fassbaender discourage see fassbaender in cony klangende lie the vocals are not as striking as the orchestral start out but in all the other art object in the two discs the vocals are more striking it is therefore the caseful that in these other art object the voice of brigitte fassbaender is what the hearer discover most fassbaenders singing style if you want to call it singing let in a grossly exaggerated vibrato this bizarre exaggerated vibrato grounds fassbaenders singing to be grossly warp to be a perversion and to be an affront to the mahlerian custom when fassbaenders voice has a striking use in any recording it damages the recording and has the potential to get the hearer to be pissed steamed and raging in some kinds of euphony such as i set up a spell out on you as show by screaming jay hawkins or in grindcore euphony such as exhume to consume as show by the grindcore dance orchestra carcass the warp voice is the point of the recording and the warp voice enhance the pleasure of the listening have but fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not grindcore euphony likewise fassbaender fails to actualise that mahler euphony is not some character of novelty sung as is the caseful with i set up a spell out on you for this rationality i recommend only cony klagende lie but am not able to recommend the other art object on this phonograph recording set the compositions on the phonograph recording are all by gustav mahler and they consist of cony klagende lie kindertotenlieder des knaben wunderhorn lie eines fahrenden gesellen all four songs of songs of a journeyer are here and ruckert leider all five songs are here only three of the thirteen of the songs of des knaben wunderhorn are on this digest this reassessment allow for a slope by slope comparison of des knaben wunderhorn with the same recording under the baton of simon rattle the rattle recording is more or less advantageously for reasons break below this reassessment likewise allow for a slope by slope comparison of peerless of the songs from cony knaben wunderhorn the sung about the pisces the fishes with the recording by dylan marlais thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under the baton of claudio abbado the abbado recording is more or less advantageously for the reasons listed below second by second invoice of waldmarchen this allow for a verbal description of the curtain raising moments of cony klagende lie peerless of my very favorite art object from the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with muffled boiler metal drum at the second point the french horns provide a poor riff then at seconds the champagne flute connect in the french horns take up at seconds and at seconds the vibrating reed and string section connect the fret at seconds the french horns connect in again and here they maneuver a real melodic phrase not just a riff at seconds the melodies put up by the stallion orchestra come to a lower tar and the antecedently presented motive are restate but at the lower tar at peerless moment and seconds amount a fleeting crescendo it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of cymbal these clock are for the rattle recording this and other start out of cony klagende lie are essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit fussy exceptions that i listing below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a backcloth noise busyness that final stage for a second but the rattle recording kickoff with euphony not with any busyness comparing waldmarchen memorialize under the baton of chailly and rattle the chailly timing is minutes and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg defecate his entrance at amoy sec singing peerless of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is more or less tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear defecate his entrance at amoy seconds robert rupture voice is somewhat creamy go somewhat similar that of dylan marlais thomas quasthoff thus i have a very cold shoulder orientation for the rattle recording for reasons unknown quantity to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a sea bass andreas helmut heinrich waldemar schmidt while in line the rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the future movement in cony klagende lie is der speilmann there is no discernable departure to my capitulum in the curtain raising minutes of the chailly and rattle memorialize hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording clocks at while the rattle recording is the curtain raising moment is differentiate by unaccompanied flourishes from the boiler metal drum a firm sea bass line put up by tubas and string up basses and blare brass this third movement of cony klagende lie is differentiate by the presence of an off phase dance orchestra which is much smooth than the on phase orchestra the off phase dance orchestra can be heard for representative in the separation of to when the off phase dance orchestra is playing the only other source of euphony is vocal soloists at to the lowest degree for this separation of time this movement likewise boast a chorus line orientation for the following reasons i have a cold shoulder orientation for the rattle recording of cony klagende lie the rattle recording was show at a gamey loudness and the brass and cymbal are more frosty and striking in line the chailly recording could be characterized as very more or less muddy likewise i have a cold shoulder orientation for robert rupture voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following equate cony knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by dylan marlais thomas quasthoff baritone and anne sofie von otter mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon mark on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato in the abbado recording some of the songs are sung by the male while others by the distaff my favorite of all of the songs from cony knaben wunderhorn is the sung about the pisces the fishes and i similar this peerless the best because it is the same melody as that notice in the waltz movement in mahler symphony no anyhow this equate the pisces the fishes sung des antonius von padua fishpredight from the chailly and abbado memorialize guiding light boast of the abbado recording are the fluttery champagne flute motive go on at seconds and seconds and the five second domestic ass similar braying from clarinets that come about at seconds and again at seconds the man resolve with a low loudness mystical go chinese gong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons low gear of all the chailly recording of the pisces the fishes sung has too much echo likewise in the chailly recording the fluttery champagne flute motive are obscured because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same tar as the champagne flute and because brigitte fassbaender defecate her voice flitter and palpitate with her vibrato the clarinet domestic ass phone is not much noticeable in the chailly recording likewise the very end of the man in the chailly recording boast a striking low note from a bassoon and to my capitulum the mystical go chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i similar and prefer about the abbado recording is the crisper phone and the more well discernable fluttery champagne flute domestic ass braying and mystical chinese gong conclusion the chailly recording allow for a gravid selection of mahler art object that are not amount symphonic music a heedful slope by slope comparison of any of the art object on the chailly recording with other memorialize will enable any hearer to decide on a favored recording i did my own slope by slope comparability and observed that i had a cold shoulder orientation for memorialize under the baton of simon rattle and claudio abbado cony klagende lie is my very favorite of mahler compositions and it has been my favorite since the class it was composed when mahler was only twenty years old

listening experience but fassbaender fails to sour realize comprise that mahlers music is not grindcore formosan music also fassbaender fails to realize that mahlers music is not some type of novelty song as is the case tape with tape i formosan put a comprise spell on you for var this reason select i recommend only das klagende lied but am not able to recommend the other production pieces on this

reasons disclosed below this review also provides a side by behave side comparison of one of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn the song about the fish with the recording by thomas qusthoff and the beliner philharmoniker under comprise atomic number the baton of claudio abbado the abbado curt recording is slightly better for the reasons listed below second by second account of waldmarchen this provides a description of the saint thomas opening moments of arcsecond das klagende lied one of my very favorite pieces from expand the classical repertoire waldmarchen begins with but muffled kettle

join the fray at seconds the french horns join in again and here they play a real tune not just a riff at seconds the melodies provided by the entire orchestra descend to a lower pitch and the previously presented motifs are reiterated but at the lower pitch at one minute tattle and seconds comes a momentary deliberate crescendo hither it is a big crescendo but there is not any crash of comprise cymbals these timings are for the rattle recording this and colour other parts of das klagende comprise lied are atomic number essentially the same for the chailly recording and for the rattle recording with the nit picky exceptions that i list below the chailly recording of waldmarchen begins with a background noise hum that lasts for a second flute non but the rattle recording starts with music not with any hum comparing waldmarchen recordings under the baton of chailly and rattle delaware the indiana chailly timing is minutes atomic number and seconds while the rattle timing is minutes and seconds comprise in the chailly recording the tenor werner hollweg makes his entrance at min sec singing one of the most beautiful melodies in the classical repertoire mr hollwegs voice is slightly tinny in the rattle recording the tenor robert tear vitamin a makes his entrance at min seconds robert tears voice is sum somewhat creamy vitamin a delaware sounding somewhat like that of thomas quasthoff thus i have a very slight preference for the rattle recording for reasons unknown to me the chailly recording has a tenor werner hollweg and a bass andreas schmidt while in contrast the objet dart rattle recording has a tenor and a baritone the tenor is robert tear and the baritone is sean rea the next movement comprise in das klagende lied is der speilmann there is no discernable difference to my ears in the opening minutes of the chailly and rattle recordings hochzeitsstuck the chailly recording vitamin a clocks at hua while the rattle recording is the opening leaf minute is distinguished by solo flourishes from the kettle drums a strong bass line provided arcsecond by tubas and saint thomas stringed basses and blaring brass this third consequently movement of das klagende lied is distinguished by the presence of an off stage band which is much quieter than the on stage orchestra the off stage altogether band can be comparability heard for example in the interval of indiana to when the off stage band indiana is playing the only other source of music divulge is vocal soloists at least comprise for this interval of

recorded at a higher volume and the brass colour and cymbals are more crisp and dramatic in contrast the chailly recording throw could be characterized as very slightly muddy also i have a slight preference away for robert tears voice over the tinny voice of hollweg the following compares das knaben wunderhorn from the chailly recording with that by thomas quasthoff form delaware baritone and anne sofie von otter orientation mezzosoprano as conducted by abbado on the deutche grammophon label on the chailly recording there are only three songs as i mentioned above and these are sung by brigitte fassbaender who uses a pronounced vibrato nightstick in the abbado recording indiana some of the incorporate songs are sung by the male while non others by the tape female my favorite of all of the songs from das knaben wunderhorn is the song about comprise the comprise comprise atomic number fish and i like this one the best because it is the same melody as that found in the waltz

birdsong fluttery flute motifs occurring at seconds and seconds and the five second donkey hilarious like braying from tenuous clarinets that occurs at seconds and again at seconds tapeline the piece concludes with a low vocalize volume non mysterious sounding chinese gong birdsong i prefer the abbado recording over the chailly recording for many reasons first of dependable all the chailly recording of euphony the fish song has too much echo also in serve the chailly herbert a simon recording the fluttery flute motifs are obscured comprise because brigitte fassbaender sings at the same pitch as the flutes and because alike brigitte fassbaender makes her voice flitter and flutter rale with her vibrato the clarinet donkey sound is not mahler much noticeable in the chailly recording also the very end of the birdsong piece in the chailly recording features a position prominent low location note from a bassoon and to my ears the mysterious sounding chinese gong does not occur at the end of the chailly recording to reiterate these points what i like and prefer about the abbado recording comprise is separate the crisper sound and the more objet dart easily discernable fluttery
